Rick Scott, who is expected to announce on Monday that he is running for the United States Senate against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent.\n\nMr. Scott, a multimillionaire former health care executive whose style is more suited to the boardroom than the stump, is not frequently sought to campaign for fellow Republicans. But if the governor operates as he has in the past, he will likely spend big and early on television ads that could benefit other Republicans unable to purchase much airtime in Florida\u2019s expensive broadcast markets. His campaign team, unencumbered by a serious primary challenge, will be able to focus on mobilizing voters for the November general election.\n\nIn Mr. Scott, Mr. Nelson will face his toughest opponent since his election to the Senate in 2000; Democrats are expected to invest tens of millions of dollars to defend his seat. But Mr. Scott, too, will have to answer for Mr. Trump. He led a \u201csuper PAC\u201d raising money for the president during the 2016 election, and has been a frequent guest at the White House and Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Palm Beach estate.\n\nIn the past year, as he has prepared for the Senate race, Mr. Scott has broken with the president several times. He pressed the White House to let 32,500 Haitians, living in Florida under temporary protected status, remain in the country. He opposed the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has protected many immigrants brought into the country illegally as children from deportation. He pushed against allowing oil drilling off Florida\u2019s shores. And he made repeated trips to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, trying to establish a response to the catastrophic storm that was more proactive than the federal government\u2019s.\n\nMost important, perhaps, Mr. Scott signed off on new restrictions on firearm purchases after the Parkland shooting in defiance of the National Rifle Association, neutralizing some of the opposition he would have otherwise faced from vocal students and their families. That has not stopped Democrats from accusing the governor of acting only when it was politically convenient, especially given the lack of state action after a gunman killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016.", "title": "Florida\u2019s Governor, Eyeing Senate Run, Offers Hope to an Unsteady G.O.P.", "authors": []}

I assumed we didn\u2019t have much of a future: We were 10 years apart, shared no hobbies and I drank. What fun could possibly come from sobriety?\n\nA few weeks into our courtship \u2014 started mainly because we kept responding to each other\u2019s emails \u2014 we were walking through Chelsea Market. Our hands grazed, and as I glimpsed up at the back of her head, I had this feeling deep in my gut that I would love her. Not in that moment, not yet, but I knew in the way seasons change that I would love her before this one ended.\n\nI asked her early on why she had stopped drinking, and she described feeling as if everyone around her had known to get on a train moving forward, but she was watching from the road as these people slowly passed her by.\n\nI took stock of my life: a new relationship, wonderful friends, a rewarding job. Drinking had not kept me off the train. My heart exhaled; maybe I was safe.\n\nA few months later I was out late, propelled by a thirst to belong, and I walked unsteadily into the bathroom. The mirror caught my reflection, and suddenly I was squinting into my eyes, trying to figure out how I could be madly in love with someone but know in my core that if the person I was drinking with at this bar made a move, I would go along with it.\n\nThe next morning I called Sarah. \u201cI don\u2019t have a healthy relationship with alcohol,\u201d I said, cursing myself for saying it out loud because I knew she could never unhear it. But I knew: If I drank, I would cheat, and she would leave. She had the tools and presence to move on, and I didn\u2019t. She would be the one who got away.", "title": "Flying Close to Temptation", "authors": []}

Huge portions of advertising dollars in the last few years have gone to the big tech giants that we read about all the time \u2014 specifically Google and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, companies like Snap. Lately, advertisers have said they\u2019re spending more money on Amazon. So there are still more major changes afoot.\n\nAs for how advertisers are looking at tech \u2014 it can be a double-edged sword. The ability to follow consumers wherever they go online comes with the risk that brands could end up with their ads appearing on conspiracy and extremist sites or offensive YouTube videos. Platforms like Twitter have made it easy for brands to talk to consumers, but it\u2019s also opened them up to new criticism, demands and potential boycotts.\n\nAdvertisers are also grappling with how to measure their ads in this new world. That\u2019s a challenge throughout the industry. Think of all the ways that people watch TV shows now. I recently watched \u2014 or, more accurately, binged \u2014 NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d I watched the first season on Netflix, where there were no ads, then saw the first eight episodes of the second season through NBC\u2019s Apple TV app, where there were lots of commercials. I watched the final few on Hulu, which might have had different ads. That type of behavior \u2014 especially since I was using my parents\u2019 cable login for the NBC app \u2014 is a new kind of challenge for the people buying, selling and measuring ads.\n\nWhat do you think of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s power in the online ad industry?\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous topic within the advertising industry, which generally refers to Google and Facebook as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d It\u2019s pretty remarkable that two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies make virtually all of their money from selling online ads and dominate more than half of the American digital ad market.\n\nTheir size and influence make it essential for people to really understand how the companies\u2019 business models work and the types of information they\u2019re sharing with them every day \u2014 and what makes them such powerful advertising machines.\n\nObviously, advertisers are drawn to Facebook and Google properties because people are spending lots of time there. But they\u2019re also fast and easy to use and rely heavily on automation. Lately, we seem to be getting a crash course in how the tools that advertisers love can be misused, whether it\u2019s in the political realm or through fraudulent or discriminatory ads. I\u2019m interested to see how humans factor into solving some of these issues \u2014 for example, YouTube is implementing more human screening of videos to assuage advertisers\u2019 fears about appearing on inappropriate content.", "title": "Following the Trail of Online Ads, Wherever It Leads", "authors": []}

The first discussion that I led was, \u201cIf you could look back today, what were the three things that you would change?\u201d That brought out a very good conversation, and the next one was on mentoring. I\u2019m very happy to be part of it.\n\nSo what would you do differently?\n\nThe very first thing that I said was, \u201cYou have to remember, when I started in the art world it was 1990.\u201d Things have changed. I might have been working in what was called a contemporary field, but I was really only working with artists that were already very established. Every work of art had to be at least 10 years old before we sold it, and I don\u2019t think I got out enough. It took me a few more years, courtesy of Charles Saatchi and the like, to pick up on the truly contemporary scene.

How does that change your thinking?\n\nI love that question. I genuinely think that we have a chance to make a big dent in the duopoly. We can give collectors a third option that they like. I think the time is right. We really want to be the premier auction house in all areas that have to do with the 20th and 21st century. And, when you look at certain market segments, we are world leaders. We\u2019ve got the top worldwide market share in watches. We are also leaders in photography.

And since 2014 our sales are up 80 percent across the company.\n\nWhat makes you want to collect art?\n\nHow can you be in this market, and live in this world, and not want to buy things? I\u2019ve had a chance to work closely with some artists, like Damien Hirst. He and I did an amazing charity sale with Bono for (RED), and of course, the \u201cBeautiful Inside My Head Forever\u201d auction, that brought 220 works of art directly from the studio to market. And so, of course I\u2019ve also collected Damien over the years.\n\nThat\u2019s no small buy-in. How many Hirsts do you own?\n\nIf we\u2019re counting prints, I have more than five. Less than 10.\n\nWho else?\n\nI really, really do love Gerhard Richter. Obviously, you know, he is very expensive, but wherever I saw an opportunity, whether it\u2019s an edition or whether it\u2019s an overpainted postcard, I take it. I\u2019ve got one of his wonderful 1989 souvenirs. I don\u2019t own, and probably won\u2019t own, a large painting. But it\u2019s not about scale.\n\nDo you think living with art as a collector gives you a useful perspective in terms of your job?\n\nYes. And I\u2019m lucky that in my office I can hang works of art that are coming up for sale \u2014 I spend time with the art. I\u2019m lucky to have something amazing with me for six or eight weeks.

He initially shared his views on a blog, which he said only a few fellow doctors read. He then spread it on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service, where it was viewed more than 2,000 times, according to the police.\n\nBut the title of Dr. Tan\u2019s article was eye-catching: \u201cChina\u2019s miracle liquor, \u2018Hongmao Medical Tonic,\u2019 a poison from heaven.\u201d Dr. Tan argued that the supposed curative effects of the 67 ingredients said to be used in the alcohol-based elixir were unclear at best, and could be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But then this week, a news report mentioned his detention and his case became a national controversy.\n\nAfter the initial reports, the police in Liangcheng County at first insisted that they had plenty of evidence to support their charge.\n\nBut they wilted under the pressure and criticism of the state-run news media, as well as the Chinese Medical Doctor Association. The Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate, the top national prosecution office, ordered the police to release him for lack of evidence.\n\nDr. Tan was freed on a kind of bail.

More than a decade of deprivation and desperation, with little hope of relief, has led thousands of young Gazans to throw themselves into a protest that few, if any, think can actually achieve its stated goal: a return to the homes in what is now Israel that their forebears left behind in 1948.\n\nIn five weeks of protests, 46 people have been killed, and hundreds more have been badly wounded, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nWith its 64 percent unemployment rate among the young, Gaza, under a blockade maintained by Israel and Egypt for years, presents countless men like Mr. Gerim with the grimmest of options.\n\nThey can seek an education in preparation for lives and careers that now seem out of reach, and hope for a chance to eventually emigrate. They can join groups like Hamas or Islamic Jihad, devoting themselves to armed conflict with Israel in return for a livelihood and a sense of purpose and belonging. Or they can stay home, staving off boredom by smoking shisha, a tobacco-molasses mix, or stronger stuff, and wait for things to change.\n\nMr. Gerim considers himself neither a terrorist nor a freedom fighter. He is not much for prayer or for politics; he says he does not belong to Hamas or Fatah or any other faction. He is a young man with nothing to do, for whom the protests have offered a chance to barbecue with friends late into the night, sleep late most mornings, make himself useful while singing songs of love or martyrdom or an end to suffering, and lash out at a hated enemy all afternoon.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me if they shoot me or not,\u201d he said in a quiet moment inside his family\u2019s tent. \u201cDeath or life \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe protests, with an outdoor festival\u2019s schedule of fun and games, performances and creative programming \u2014 and carnage every Friday \u2014 is meant to build to a climax on May 15, the day Palestinians mark the Nakba, or catastrophe, of their flight and expulsion when Israel was established 70 years ago.\n\nThe protest, which grew out of a young activist\u2019s Facebook page and was a grass-roots initiative before being embraced, organized and publicized by Hamas, the militant Islamist group that rules Gaza, has hardly scared the Israelis into altering their basic policy. Israel continues to treat the tiny coastal enclave like a deadly virus to be quarantined and, other than that, more or less tunes it out.\n\nBut it has been a success in one important respect: It has cast a light onto the unsolved problem that is Gaza, and reminded a world that had seemed to move on to more urgent crises that its two million people, deprived of clean water, freedom of movement and a steady supply of electricity, are sliding steadily into despair.\n\nMr. Gerim is typical in another way: He does not think of Gaza as his home, but he has no idea what home is.\n\nHis grandmother, Haniya al-Kurdi, 80, was a little girl when her family left what is now Ashdod, Israel, in 1948. She has never been back, but has heard that there is a coffee shop next to where her home was. The closest anyone else in the family has gotten was in 2013, when Mr. Gerim\u2019s sister, Sabreen, now 26, contracted cancer and was allowed to spend a year in Tel Aviv getting treatment. On the way there, her mother, Iktimal al-Gerim, asked their driver to point out Ashdod to them from the highway.\n\nFor Mr. Gerim, the family\u2019s old property is an idea more than a place he can actually picture.\n\nIsraelis themselves he has had more experience with. When he was about 10, before the Israelis evacuated their Gaza settlements in 2005, Mr. Gerim climbed a tree outside his grandfather\u2019s house to get a better look at the soldiers a few hundred yards away. Then he fell to the ground and broke his right hand.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

But the closest he has ever gotten is loading tuk-tuks \u2014 motorcycles with cargo beds \u2014 or handling a pushcart to distribute sacks of donated flour, sugar and other staples to his fellow refugees.\n\nIn the autumn, Mr. Gerim sometimes harvests olives. When there is construction work, he looks for chances to lay bricks or pour concrete. He has never had a regular job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is stoic for a 22-year-old, though this may be an acquired response to adversity: His father is mentally ill, Mr. Gerim says, given to flying into destructive rages over the slightest disappointments. His family \u2014 two younger brothers, their sister and their parents \u2014 all share a single room with a tile floor and blankets but no beds. The kitchen floor is sand. The family\u2019s debts are choking them, he says.\n\nMr. Gerim\u2019s industriousness shows at the protests, as does his stoicism.\n\nOn Thursday, he arrived early at his family\u2019s tent, a roomy contraption that was provided to them by the protest\u2019s organizers, and set about sweeping the tarpaulin floor for the first of several times, before building a fire and cooking eggplants and tomatoes that city workers were distributing to the needy.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt lunch, a charity handed out meals of chicken and rice, and then Mr. Gerim swept the floor of crumbs and bones, singing a love song as he did.\n\nHe has no girlfriend, and no hopes of marrying. \u201cThere is no money, no work,\u201d he explained. \u201cMarriage is not free.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, he walked up to the fence for a quick look across at the Israeli soldiers, then foraged for firewood. He dragged a six-foot log more than a quarter-mile back to the tent, and broke it apart with his hands and feet.\n\nLater, he assembled kites from sticks, clear plastic and paper \u2014 and talked about attaching soda cans to them stuffed with gasoline-soaked rags, to sail over the fence and maybe set something or someone on fire.\n\nAt 10 p.m., he and his friends began barbecuing a feast for 12. It didn\u2019t end until 2:30 a.m. It takes a long time to cook 22 pounds of chicken wings on a grill about 18 inches across.\n\nSitting around the fire, a friend named Abu Moaz, 25, said he wanted to use a kite to drop leaflets in Hebrew and Arabic warning Israeli soldiers to \u201cevacuate your houses and return to the countries from which you came.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEveryone liked the sound of that.\n\nMr. Gerim went home to sleep, but was back at the tent at 8 a.m. on Friday, sweeping again, building the wood fire, drinking tea with his neighbors.\n\nHe went to Friday Prayer, then ate a falafel sandwich.\n\nAt 2:30, he was crouching behind the barbed-wire barrier, whirling his slingshot like a helicopter rotor, aiming in vain at Israeli soldiers again and again.\n\nAround 5 p.m., he saw a group of men a few hundred yards to the south, and ran to see what they were doing. They had breached the barbed wire, and were trying to get to the main fence marking Israeli territory. Mr. Gerim hung back, and did not try to join them.\n\nNear him, a man fell, hit in the stomach by what seemed like a grenade fragment, Mr. Gerim said.\n\nHe was not shocked by this, he said afterward.\n\n\u201cI could be shot or killed anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nNight had fallen now; the protesters were headed home. And soon Mr. Gerim was singing again \u2014 this time a Lebanese tune of weariness with conflict.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he crooned softly in Arabic. \u201cEnough for miseries, promises and words.

Fifty years ago, Ms. Collins and Stephen Stills of Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young became romantically involved while making an album together.

More than 1,700 contributed nearly $500,000 to the \u201cFloyd Fairness Fund.\u201d\n\nBut Landis lost his legal fight and ended up ostracized from cycling. The whistle-blowing began.

But the right-wing and populist League, led by the equally ambitious Matteo Salvini, 45, emerged as the leader of a coalition of parties that won even more votes, but still not enough to form a government on its own.\n\nAs a result, both men have strong claims to lead the next government. Neither seems particularly eager to let the opportunity of a lifetime slip away.\n\n\u201cAccording to the rules of our democracy, it is necessary that there be some accords between different political forces to form a coalition,\u201d Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, who has the job of cobbling together a sustainable government from the fractured parties, said on Thursday at the presidential palace. \u201cThis condition has not yet emerged.\u201d\n\nFor now \u2014 a key phrase when discussing fluid Italian politics \u2014 it seems doubtful such conditions will soon present themselves.\n\nFor now, Mr. Di Maio says he is seeking support in Parliament from the center-left Democratic Party, which suffered a crushing defeat and was incessantly demonized by Five Star\u2019s vast and often virulent social media network. (In an interview published in Saturday\u2019s La Repubblica newspaper, Mr. Di Maio said it was time to \u201cbury the hatchet.\u201d)\n\nFor now, the Democratic Party has resisted Five Star\u2019s entreaties and retreated to the opposition.\n\nFor now, Mr. Di Maio has said he refuses to join any government involving Silvio Berlusconi, the octogenarian whom Five Star leaders called a mafioso and a psychotic dwarf.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor now, Mr. Salvini won\u2019t abandon Mr. Berlusconi, whose comeback plans suffered a humiliating setback when Mr. Salvini outperformed him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, Mr. Di Maio and Mr. Salvini, who have expressed a similarly jaundiced outlook toward Europe, migrants and changes to the pensions system, are maintaining their opposing positions, despite Roman graffiti depicting the two in a lusty embrace.\n\nAnd for now, Mr. Di Maio says he is honoring the term-limit rule, of which he has said he is \u201cproud.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on March 13 at Rome\u2019s Foreign Press Club, Mr. Di Maio fielded a question about whether the term limit would still be valid if the president had to call new elections.

But he insisted such a maneuver had \u201cnever been discussed.\u201d\n\nThe party has loosened apparently hard-and-fast rules in the past.\n\nIt scratched its early ban on members appearing on television, hired a media consultant and flooded the airwaves with telegenic candidates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Di Maio and others hailed him as a model of good governance, but when he announced his desire to run for re-election, he found himself on the outs with the party\u2019s power-brokers.\n\nMr. Fucci argued in an interview that while the rule perhaps made sense 10 years ago when the party was a fringe protest movement, it was now \u201cillogical.\u201d\n\nNow that Five Star had become the leading political force in the country, the term limits prevented the formation of a management class with the necessary expertise at the local, regional and national levels, he said.\n\nTo make his case, Mr. Fucci and others traveled up to Milan in the Spring of 2017 to Casaleggio Associates, the internet consulting firm run by Davide Casaleggio, the son of the party\u2019s co-founder and the keeper of the web platform upon which Five Star elections are held.\n\nMr. Fucci said Mr. Casaleggio, who is unelected and unchecked by term limits, has a \u201chuge role\u201d in political decisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe was inflexible,\u201d Mr. Fucci said, recalling Mr. Casaleggio as saying, \u201cThe rule doesn\u2019t change and you can forget it.\u201d\n\nBut that was for Mr. Fucci. Now it is the career of Mr. Di Maio, the mainstream face of the party, that is at stake.\n\nIf the legislature were to be cut short for new elections, \u201cnot only Di Maio but dozens of newly elected members of Parliament\u201d would be barred from running again. \u201cThis will weaken greatly the Five Star Movement,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond automatically reinstating nominations, the Italian press has reported that the party has considered redefining two mandates as 10 years in office.\n\nMr. Fucci said he considered some such maneuver \u201cvery probable.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, and I say this with disappointment and bitterness,\u201d he said, \u201cthey change the rules because it\u2019s convenient.

She mothered her kids in every kind of living quarter imaginable \u2014 cheap inns, well-heeled mansions, hotel rooms, apartments and the back of a station wagon that she drove from Maine to Texas every year. She hosted 1,192 events at her house and 1,232 events in Washington. Yet she still answered her own front door. Her smile was genuine, her delight infectious. Mrs. Bush liked to laugh, and she could converse as easily with a Mexican mother of seven as she could with a head of state. It made no difference. She was a true Christian. My mother admired her.\n\nShe was not without fault. Her public statements sometimes caused controversy. She recalled wearing sneakers to meet the prime minister of Greece. When she was a young bride-to-be and was called upon to cook for Mr. Bush\u2019s younger brothers, her future mother-in-law bragged to Mrs. Bush\u2019s mother that Barbara was a wonderful cook. Her mother, shocked, responded, \u201cOh?\u201d Peanut butter and jelly was the actual menu. It didn\u2019t matter. The menu was love, something Mrs. Bush learned from her own mother, whom she would lose in an auto accident after she married, unable to attend the funeral because she was living in California and very pregnant with her second child and, ironically, her own duties as a wife and mother prevented it. There was nothing to do. Family comes first.\n\nAnd what a family she raised. In the tight-knuckled, bare-fisted world of Washington politics, the Bushes proved over the years that they could hit as hard as anyone. Some did not like it.

The team also argued that Mr. Manafort had no right to challenge Mr. Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction. (It did not, however, invoke the widespread belief that Mr. Mueller is using the Ukraine charges to pressure Mr. Manafort to divulge what he knows about 2016 events as part of a plea bargain.)\n\nBut members of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team also backed up those arguments with a striking move: They emphatically pointed to their subordination to Mr. Rosenstein \u2014 the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions is recused from it.\n\nWhile Mr. Rosenstein has testified that he knows about and approves of what Mr. Mueller is doing, the filing went into significant new detail, including disclosing that Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo on Aug. 2 blessing the idea that Mr. Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction extends to Mr. Manafort\u2019s Ukraine-linked dealings.\n\n\u201cThe acting attorney general appointed the special counsel, defined his jurisdiction, understands the scope of his investigation and has specifically confirmed that the allegations that form the basis\u201d of Mr. Manafort\u2019s prosecution are within Mr. Mueller\u2019s purview, the filing said. \u201cIn these circumstances, no serious question of political accountability can be raised.\u201d\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s assertive use of a Trump appointee\u2019s control over his investigation as a shield against Mr. Manafort\u2019s attack was a remarkable moment in the history of recurring tensions over the independence of investigations touching on high-level executive branch officials.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the Watergate scandal, in which President Richard M. Nixon forced the Justice Department to fire the prosecutor investigating him, Congress enacted a law permitting the appointment of an \u201cindependent\u201d counsel who would report to a panel of judges rather than to a presidential appointee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court upheld Congress\u2019s constitutional power to make that arrangement in a 1988 case, both political parties came to see it as a bad idea. In 1999, when the independent counsel statute expired, lawmakers did not renew it.\n\nAs a replacement, the Justice Department created a regulation to permit the appointment, from outside the government, of a special counsel who would exercise day-to-day independence but remain subject to control by the attorney general, who could veto decisions like whether to file charges or expand jurisdiction. At the same time, it limited the attorney general\u2019s power to fire a special counsel to cases of misconduct.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bush\u2019s administration \u2014 the appointment in 2003 of Patrick J. Fitzgerald to investigate who leaked the identity of Valerie Plame Wilson, a C.I.A. official \u2014 bypassed its envisioned arrangement.\n\nMr. Fitzgerald, then a United States attorney in Chicago, was appointed as a special counsel by James B. Comey, then the deputy attorney general, after Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation. Mr. Comey also delegated his supervisory powers as the acting attorney general to Mr. Fitzgerald, permitting the prosecutor to take major investigative steps \u201cindependent of the supervision or control of any officer of the department.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May from his subsequent job as F.B.I. director and Mr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel, Mr. Rosenstein invoked the regulation \u2014 meaning he retained supervisory control.\n\nAt the time, some Democrats greeted that arrangement with suspicion. They worried that Mr. Rosenstein \u2014 a Trump appointee who had helped with Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Mr. Comey by writing a memo criticizing Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation \u2014 would keep Mr. Mueller on a short leash.\n\nDuring a June hearing, for example, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, pressed Mr. Rosenstein to instead create a more independent special counsel who could oversee himself, like Mr. Fitzgerald.\n\n\u201cAre you willing to do as has been done before?\u201d she demanded.\n\nMr. Rosenstein demurred. While noting that Mr. Bush could have fired Mr. Fitzgerald for any reason \u2014 so working under the regulation gave Mr. Mueller greater protection \u2014 he also said there were other complicated legal issues that led him to his decision. (One of the complexities may have been that Mr. Mueller was not a current Justice Department employee at the time of his appointment, unlike Mr. Fitzgerald in 2003, so Mr. Mueller most likely could not have been delegated attorney general supervisory powers, Mr. Katyal said.)\n\nThe anxieties of that period make it all the more striking that, 10 months later, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is stressing his subordination to Mr. Rosenstein to repel Mr. Manafort\u2019s attack.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, several specialists cautioned that Mr. Mueller\u2019s subordination could revert to a weakness if Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Sessions or Mr. Rosenstein, putting someone else in charge of the special counsel.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Julie O\u2019Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and a former federal prosecutor, worried about the lengths the filing went to in detailing Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s approval for Mr. Mueller\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cMueller\u2019s lack of independence was viewed as a real problem, but now it\u2019s a response to any attack on the indictment,\u201d she said. \u201cI do wonder, though, if he hasn\u2019t put Rosenstein in additional jeopardy.\u201d", "title": "For Mueller, a Feared Weakness Becomes a Strength", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"]}

Rod Blagojevich of Illinois during his Senate trial in 2009 when Mr. Blagojevich was convicted and removed from office. \u201cIt\u2019s governed by the legislature, not the courts. Courts have all sorts of procedural protections built in \u2014 due process rights, impartial juries \u2014 but you cannot perfectly analogize that to the legislative realm.\u201d\n\nWith impeachments still relatively rare, even as some Democrats talk of removing President Trump from office, lawyers working recent cases in state capitals like Montgomery, Ala., have found little precedent to guide them. Instead they often find that the processes long codified in constitutions can, in modern practice, be murky to the point of inviting chaos.\n\nThat lack of clarity invites clashes about privileges and subpoena power, legislative authority and access to evidence. Arcane-seeming subjects may be able to reshape a state\u2019s approach to executive power. And a particular brand of politics \u2014 fueled by self-flagellation, piety, pride and legal jeopardy \u2014 seems to thread through every threatened impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common structure, but as far as how you\u2019re supposed to do it on the ground, substantively or procedurally or in terms of burden of proof, there\u2019s a lot of debate on that, and not a lot of consensus,\u201d said Jackson R. Sharman III, who was special counsel to the Alabama legislative committee that investigated Gov. Robert Bentley before his resignation last year.\n\nThe absence of norms lends extraordinary influence to the lawyers who are often tasked with speedily setting up something resembling, but not always behaving like, a traditional investigation and trial.\n\nMr. Ellis was counsel to the state\u2019s House speaker when legislative leaders urged him to take the case, a role he said he accepted only after \u201ca pregnant pause.\u201d He had about two weeks to prepare for trial.\n\nMr. Garber, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer who once edited his high school newspaper, more or less fell into impeachments as a legal niche. After Mr. Garber\u2019s bid for Connecticut state treasurer faltered \u2014 he was \u201cthe silver medalist,\u201d he noted wryly \u2014 Gov. John G. Rowland\u2019s office sought the lawyer\u2019s help for a federal corruption investigation. Mr. Rowland had lawyers on his staff, but, like those in all governor\u2019s offices, they were far more familiar with legislative haggling than with inquiries that could lead to prison terms.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rowland resigned before lawmakers could decide whether to impeach him. But Mr. Garber, who describes his work as safeguarding the institutional traditions and privileges of the governor\u2019s offices he represents, had stumbled into a legal arena in which few others were experts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was later asked to advise Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, whom lawmakers eventually declined to impeach over accusations connected to his whereabouts while he visited his mistress in Argentina.\n\nAnd then last year, Mr. Garber, whose usual work includes handling regulatory investigations and international trade issues, was on Mr. Bentley\u2019s team after the Alabama governor was enmeshed in a sex scandal.

State legislatures have impeached a host of lower-ranking officials, from a university regent in Nebraska to a Kentucky agriculture commissioner, but only 16 governors have ever been impeached, and almost all were before the Great Depression.\n\nAlthough some governors, like Mr. Sanford, withstand the pressure, modern governors tend to succumb to political or legal realities and leave office before an impeachment can happen.\n\nNeither Mr. Bentley, who now practices dermatology in an Alabama college town, nor Mr. Sanford, a member of Congress, responded to messages. Mr. Blagojevich and Mr. Rowland, who were convicted of corruption charges after leaving office, are in federal custody.\n\nFor Mr. Garber, whose bills are often paid with tax dollars because he is not representing a governor\u2019s personal interests, part of his job is ensuring that politics alone do not settle impeachments and undermine the authority of governors for generations to come.\n\nHis goal, he said, is to argue \u201cthat our constitutional system is set up so that elections don\u2019t get overthrown because of political whims, that elections have consequences and we don\u2019t throw those out absent very, very serious acts that affect the public official\u2019s office, that are proven with a high degree of certainty after a fair process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMissouri lawmakers are still grappling over how they will reckon with Mr. Greitens, who has been criminally charged with two felonies: invasion of privacy, for photographing a nude or partially nude person without the person\u2019s knowledge or consent, and for tampering with computer data for allegedly obtaining a charity\u2019s donor list and using it for political fund-raising.\n\nThe governor has denied criminal wrongdoing and rebuffed demands for his resignation, calling the efforts against him \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d A legislative committee will decide in the coming weeks whether to pursue the impeachment process that is broadly outlined in the Missouri Constitution.\n\nMr. Garber, who teaches about political investigations and impeachments at Tulane University\u2019s law school and largely splits his time between Washington, Hartford and New Orleans, declined to detail any of his plans for the Missouri case. His record, though, suggests that he will argue, in public and in private, that lawmakers should not hastily negate the voters\u2019 choice for governor and should save impeachment for a most exceptional case.\n\nLike just about every impeachment lawyer these days, he is likely to look to history, where the proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon remain especially important for lawyers working in state capitols. More than 40 years later, it remains a lesson in the strategies and risks that come with representing the most powerful figures in government.\n\n\u201cInstitutions, even something so sophisticated as the White House,\u201d Mr. Garber observed, \u201caren\u2019t set up to deal with these kinds of crises.\u201d", "title": "For Politicians Scraping Bottom, a Scarce Resource: Impeachment Lawyers", "authors": ["Alan Blinder"]}

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "THE LIFE TO COME\n\nBy Michelle de Kretser\n\n344 pp. Catapult. $26.\n\nThe Australian novelist Michelle de Kretser has made a habit of disputing the notion that travel necessarily broadens the mind. Her fourth novel, \u201cQuestions of Travel,\u201d which won Australia\u2019s most prestigious literary award, the Miles Franklin, contrasted the journeys of an asylum-seeker from the subcontinent with those of a backpacking travel-guide writer from Sydney. The characters in \u201cThe Life to Come,\u201d de Kretser\u2019s fifth novel, are similarly peripatetic. While they all eventually enjoy a comfortable life in suburban Sydney, some are dogged by memories of past lives in violent places. The memory of a stretch of wall split by the sun transports an elderly woman back to her childhood in Sri Lanka: \u201cPictures like that were always there, running invisibly under her Australian life, appearing now and again like snatches of an old videotape that a later recording has overlaid without entirely erasing.\u201d\n\nThe \u00e9migr\u00e9 is one kind of traveler, portrayed here with sympathy and lyricism. But de Kretser, who was born in Sri Lanka and came to Australia at 14, saves her startling satirical firepower for another \u2014 the expats of the global West, or those who can travel on a whim. In a novel that restlessly spans decades and continents, a woman named Pippa is as close as de Kretser gets to a protagonist. It is Pippa\u2019s friends, colleagues and acquaintances whose stories we learn via impressionistic flashbacks. In the late 1990s, when we meet her, she is an idealistic undergraduate in Sydney who announces \u201cI love India\u201d after watching a documentary on TV. Over time, she becomes a more interesting character, a full-fledged writer who seeks experiences in the world with which to animate her fiction. Yet Pippa remains na\u00efve. She preaches empathy for refugees on Facebook, but is careless of the inner lives of others.\n\nImage\n\nIn 2010, Pippa goes to Paris on a writing fellowship. (The ensuing novel, \u201cFrench Lessons,\u201d is a flop.) Her approach to other cultures is uncomplicated. Europe, she thinks, is \u201cmomentous and world-historical\u201d; Australia, \u201ceventless.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s all that foreign food, which can be recreated at Instagram-worthy dinner parties back home. Many scenes revolve around Pippa in the kitchen, whipping up something ostentatiously multicultural: a lamb tagine with saffron, carrots and fennel for a sick neighbor; a salad of pork and ginger during a Thai phase; local prawns for her literary agent served with lemon juice, brown bread and butter. Meals like these are as familiar in Brooklyn or Portland as they are in inner-city Sydney. Call it the cult of Ottolenghi \u2014 that trendy Israeli-British chef is name-checked on more than one occasion.\n\nIn one scene, the function of food as a status symbol for globe-trotting cosmopolites becomes clear. During her time in Paris, Pippa befriends C\u00e9leste, an older woman who lives alone. C\u00e9leste\u2019s father died in the aftermath of the massacre of Algerians in the French capital in 1961; her mother remarried an Australian man she met on the M\u00e9tro. The family emigrated to Western Australia, but in adulthood C\u00e9leste found her way back to Paris as a translator. (This is the kind of fractured life, filled with loss and hard-won visa stamps, that de Kretser protects from ridicule.)

Dawson seems to be inspired by quasi-anarchist movements like Occupy Sandy. Yet to carry out the kinds of transformations he envisions, like the expropriation of fossil fuel assets, would require a very powerful government, even though he himself argues that moneyed interests have captured the state.\n\nOf particular value is Dawson\u2019s discussion of the way climate change adaptation has been sabotaged, even hijacked, by real estate interests. Cities like Miami and New York continue to build luxury buildings on waterfront land that rising sea levels are expected to overrun. Even in developing world cities like Jakarta, projects billed as climate change mitigation, like constructing artificial barrier islands, are really gussied up luxury real estate boondoggles.\n\nDawson can\u2019t identify a clear path to the kinds of extreme reforms he advocates, but at least he puts subjects on the table that many want to avoid facing up to. For instance, rising sea levels are almost guaranteed to require painful retreats from coastal settlement. But it\u2019s much sexier to talk about building green skyscrapers than it is to envision abandoning Miami Beach.

And when I was at UCLA, in the early \u201980s, he invited me to see him at the Del Capri hotel, which was straight out of the \u201950s: kidney-shaped pools, bungalows where his dancers stayed. But while everyone was out by the pool, he was alone in a big suite, and I came to understand his loneliness: He did not have a partner.\n\nHe wanted to share a new piece about Jim Morrison which he said had \u201ca little Bill T. Jones in there,\u201d but I could not for the life of me tell which part reminded him of my style.

And then, you saw them afterwards, loading their costumes into wicker baskets to move to the next city. It was so difficult at the beginning. They did everything themselves. Everyone talks about diversity now; he cared about inclusion while keeping the company predominantly African-American. To him, this was entwined with the Civil Rights movement. But as long as you could really dance \u2014 as long as you were truly special \u2014 he didn\u2019t care what color you were.\n\nThe happiest I ever saw him, I mean, just truly happy, was when 10 of us went to the World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar in 1966.

{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cMaker of Patterns\u201d is not autobiography. That would require something more than just the long letters reproduced here, occasionally annotated with italicized commentary. But these letters will delight any reader with their often contrarian observations. Dyson is an excellent witness, an acute observer of personality and human foibles. This volume should make any reader pine for a deep memoir. Dyson has published more than a dozen books, and while his 1979 book, \u201cDisturbing the Universe,\u201d contains reminiscences, it is more philosophical than autobiographical. Readers who desire a full biography could turn to Phillip F. Schewe\u2019s 2013 \u201cMaverick Genius: The Pioneering Odyssey of Freeman Dyson.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDyson\u2019s letters are particularly engaging when they describe the occasional flashes of illumination that lead to a scientific insight. Riding on a cross-continental Greyhound bus, past Iowa cornfields, Dyson notes: \u201cOn the third day of the journey a remarkable thing happened; going into a sort of semi-stupor as one does after 48 hours of bus riding, I began to think very hard about physics, and particularly about the rival radiation theories of Schwinger and Feynman. Gradually my thoughts grew more coherent, and before I knew where I was, I had solved the problem that had been in the back of my mind all this year, which was to prove the equivalence of the two theories. \u2026 This piece of work is neither difficult nor particularly clever, but it is undeniably important.\u201d Dyson was chiefly pleased that once back in Princeton, he would \u201cnow encounter Oppenheimer with something to say which will interest him.\u201d\n\nDyson is fascinated by Oppenheimer: \u201cI have been observing rather carefully his behavior during seminars. If one is saying, for the benefit of the rest of the audience, things that he knows already, he cannot resist hurrying one on to something else; then when one says things that he doesn\u2019t know or immediately agree with, he breaks in before the point is fully explained with acute and sometimes devastating criticisms, to which it is impossible to reply adequately even when he is wrong.\u201d Dyson thought this \u201cimpatience\u201d demonstrated by \u201cOppy\u201d was beyond his control, and in any case, \u201cTo me, the interruptions provided many valuable new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe letters are also sometimes painfully candid and close to home. In early 1957, Dyson writes his parents from Aspen, Colo., where he has gone on vacation with his mathematician wife, Verena \u2014 and he has to report that Verena has \u201cfallen in love and decided to run away\u201d with one of Freeman\u2019s old Cambridge friends. Dyson is clearly devastated that his wife of six years is walking out of what he had considered a \u201chappy\u201d marriage, leaving behind two young children, Esther and George. (Both children forged innovative careers, Esther as a digital-age journalist and angel investor, and George as a historian of science.) Freeman stoically writes his parents: \u201cPlease do not offer me your sympathy or your pity. I have been happy in this marriage, and I have no regrets now it is over. \u2026 What she has done may be crazy, but it is not irresponsible.\u201d\n\nAnd then within months, Dyson\u2019s letters begin to mention the name of Imme Jung, the Berlin-born, 20-year-old au pair Verena had hired just before she walked out. \u201cThe more I see of Imme,\u201d Dyson writes his parents, \u201cthe more impressed I am with her firm and solid character.\u201d Escorting her to dinner at the Oppenheimers one night that spring, Dyson feels like \u201cHiggins taking his Eliza to the ball; after all, Imme is extremely young and has little formal education.\u201d But fortunately, that night Oppenheimer himself was charming: \u201cOppy especially went out of his way to be friendly to her.\u201d\n\nDyson was falling in love with his soon-to-be second wife. In an italicized note, he explained that for the next two years as a single dad, while the divorce was taking shape, \u201cI held back from any display of affection for Imme, but it was obvious to all.\u201d", "title": "Freeman Dyson\u2019s Life, Through His Letters", "authors": []}

After inspecting the artworks and confirming his findings with a panel of experts, he found that 82 of the 140 pieces in the collection were counterfeits.\n\nMost of the fakes were acquired after 2013 and were not on exhibit because town officials were awaiting the creation of a second floor in the museum to display its full collection, Mr. Forcada said. Still, 10 to 15 forgeries hung on the museum\u2019s walls for years, and Elne\u2019s mayor, Yves Barniol, called the fraud a catastrophe for his municipality.\n\nThe town council filed a complaint in March, leading the police to begin an investigation, and the museum reopened on Friday with about 60 paintings by Terrus, all authentic. Yet local officials said it could take years to find out who was behind the fakes.\n\nBeyond the blow to the museum\u2019s and the town\u2019s reputations, the case has illustrated the risks that European small towns face when seeking to enhance a heritage that can galvanize cultural life and attract tourists. The Terrus museum had neither a curator nor a team dedicated to acquisitions.\n\nYet after Mr. Barniol became mayor of Elne in 2014, and as the museum\u2019s founder was purchasing an increasing number of canvases in recent years, the town started to spend dozens of thousands of euros to restore some of the paintings, install better lighting and regulate the building\u2019s temperature so the works could be better preserved.", "title": "French Museum Discovers More Than Half Its Collection Is Fake", "authors": []}

Abdullah Almaatouq of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues recently showed that people are poor judges of who their friends are.\n\nWhen the researchers asked 84 college students to identify which of their classmates qualified as friends, the researchers found that in half the cases, those labeled friends failed to reciprocate the designation.\n\nOther studies have shown similar discordances or worse, with one survey revealing that 66 percent of supposed friendships were cases of unrequited like.\n\nFriendships are also surprisingly fragile. Based on a detailed survey of 540 participants, researchers at Oxford University determined that people had a falling out with a member of their social circle about once every 7.2 months, or nearly two times annually, and that a year later 40 percent of those ruptures remained unhealed.\n\nThe overall rates of friendship conflict did not differ between men and women, but women were more likely to clash with close friends, to express feelings of anguish over the breakup, and to be more demanding of evidence of remorse before reconciling.\n\nSure, love may mean never having to say you\u2019re sorry.

That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.\n\nIn a conference call, John L.

But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.\n\nG.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\n\n\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201d\n\nJust how much G.E. has invested in its digital initiatives is uncertain, but it has been several billion dollars. In an article last year in the Harvard Business Review, Mr. Immelt wrote that in 2016 \u201cwe put about $4 billion into developing analytics software and machine learning capabilities.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.\n\nThe San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.\n\nIn its early days, the San Ramon center concentrated on writing data analysis and modeling software for applications like predicting when a gas turbine or jet engine would need maintenance, before the machine failed. In 2013, G.E. called that software Predix.\n\nThe product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.\n\nThe software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nToday, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.\n\nThe priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo key products in that portfolio were acquired. In September 2016, GE Digital bought Meridium, a maker of equipment-tracking software, for $495 million. Two months later, it bought ServiceMax, whose software is used to manage industrial field service workers, for $915 million.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.\n\nThe opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.\n\nThe New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.\n\nBut for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.\n\nBrian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.\n\nBut it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201d\n\nGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\n\n\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.\n\nA smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.", "title": "G.E.

It\u2019s one of several recent books to explore how game practices and principles have been and can be applied in a lot of other areas. The book and some others \u2014 including \u201cReality Is Broken,\u201d by Jane McGonigal \u2014 put my vigorous gaming in context and taught me that companies like CVS know exactly what they\u2019re doing. In Mr. Zichermann and Ms. Linder\u2019s terms, the company has established a rapid feedback game, which works pretty much like a slot machine, without the bells and whistles and with the stipulation that you always win \u2026 something.\n\nThe books also helped me understand the particular kind of game that animates this trend, and my behavior. It\u2019s not a zero-sum, winners-and-losers sort of game, like Monopoly or cage fighting, but rather one that continues as long as you want to play and one that, in a sense, you can\u2019t win.\n\nMs. McGonigal calls this an \u201cinfinite\u201d rather than \u201cfinite\u201d game and gives the example of Tetris. You will flail around and be crushed eventually, but you can attain small triumphs along the way, maybe even achieve a personal best, and in any case you can always embark on a new game, no quarter required. The only computer game I play, the bubble-bursting Bubble Bazinga, has exactly this model.\n\nIn the same way, I can\u2019t \u201cbeat\u201d the credit card companies, but merely continue to accumulate modest savings from moment to moment. Then I die.\n\nMy gamified life may be nutty and sad, but it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. At least that\u2019s what I thought until a few months ago, when my new car insurance company, Liberty Mutual, invited me to join a program its website describes this way: \u201cUsing a small device that observes your driving habits, we\u2019ll notice the safe choices you\u2019re making on the road and reward you for them.\u201d The company promised a rate reduction of at least 5 percent and up to 30 percent, based on driving performance over a three-month period. Best of all, an app would let me track the size of my discount in real time.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you know what my answer was.\n\nI quickly learned that the key \u201cdriving habits,\u201d as far as Liberty Mutual was concerned, were jack-rabbit starts and sudden stops. Eliminating the starts proved easy, but braking was a problem. When a car pulled in front of me, I slowed down gradually enough for my C-Max to register approval. But when I got home, I saw the app had dinged me for it, dropping my discount by a percentage point.\n\nIt got in my head.

Aaron Judge struck out three times, bringing his total to 10 for the series against the Angels.\n\nSabathia, though he continued his strong start to the season with his deepest effort yet \u2014 allowing one run in seven innings \u2014 expressed his frustration with the strike zone of the home plate umpire Angel Hernandez.

He threw away a routine grounder by Mike Trout in the third and fell down when he fielded a slow grounder by Albert Pujols in the seventh. But Sabathia worked around those mistakes \u2014 and another jam in the sixth when the Angels scored their only run on a pitch that bounced well in front of the plate and past Sanchez, allowing Upton to race home. It was the fifth time in their current streak that the Yankees held an opponent to one run.\n\nGreen relieved Sabathia and escaped trouble of his own, striking out Zack Cozart with runners at first and second to end the eight.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "This was Sunday. On Friday, the first day of what was supposed to be an extended peaceful sit-in, Israeli soldiers had shot into another crowd of some 30,000 Palestinians who had gathered by the border to commemorate the killing in 1976 of six Palestinian citizens of Israel during another protest still, over Israel\u2019s expropriation of Arab land. At least 15 demonstrators were killed last week.\n\nOn Sunday, people lined up some 200 meters away from the fence separating them from the Israeli soldiers. Palestinian men in civilian clothes wouldn\u2019t allow them any closer. Only one man in a mobility scooter couldn\u2019t be stopped from entering the hot zone between the crowd and the fence.\n\nWhen he entered the area, several rounds of bullets sounded out, but he wasn\u2019t hit. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to kill another disabled activist,\u201d one of the journalists said. He was referring to Ibrahim Abu Thuraya, who had lost his legs (reportedly in a 2008 Israeli airstrike) and was shot in the head during a demonstration in Gaza in December. \u201cOtherwise, he would have been killed a while ago,\u201d the journalist added, about the man in the special scooter.\n\nMore bursts came, sudden and loud. The protesters got down. When they realized it was tear gas that had been fired, they straightened up. Lines of white smoke streaked up the blue sky and then dropped to the ground; a low cloud draped the figure of the disabled man on his machine. Moments later, paramedics rushed to help him. Eleven people were injured on Sunday in various protests throughout the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.\n\nOne of the women who had been howling, her eyes lined in kohl and blurry with tears, said: \u201cThis march is uniting us, if nothing else. Men and women of all backgrounds.\u201d A sense of togetherness did seem to have developed among the small number of people gathered in front of the lurking Israeli snipers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a march to return to our land at this very moment. It\u2019s a way for us to speak and to raise our voices,\u201d the woman said. Behind the protesters three boys aged 10 to 13 were playing football, kicking the ball high in the sky, well within range of the snipers\u2019 viewfinders.\n\nThe protesters who gathered under the burning midday sun displayed a kind of resigned hope. As if to say: We have nothing to lose, so we come here to scream our lungs out. Some knew well that they risked more than burned skin and a sore throat; they had been injured on Friday. One man came on crutches and hopped about on one foot, the other foot swinging from a scaffolding of metal sticks and screws.", "title": "Opinion | Gaza Screams for Life", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s no coincidence that the First Intifada broke out in Gaza in 1987. And it\u2019s no coincidence that Israel has embarked on three savage military offensives there over the past decade, killing thousands of people, wounding tens of thousands, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless and sowing unbelievable ruin. This would not have been possible in the West Bank, if only because there are too many Jewish settlements there now, abutting Palestinian villages.\n\nThe test case was Operation Cast Lead. In just over three weeks in December 2008 and January 2009, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, Israel killed 1,434 Palestinians in Gaza, many unarmed \u2014 compared with 14 Israelis, most of them soldiers, killed by Palestinians. The ratio is gruesome: about 100 to 1.\n\nThe world was put to the test then. Had it taken substantial action against Israel, the country might not have dared be so brutal again. A United Nations investigation known as the Goldstone Report cast heavy blame on Israel (and some on Hamas). Still, Israel read past the lip service and understood that it would have to pay nothing, not even for acts suspected of being war crimes or crimes against humanity.\n\nJust three years later, in November 2012, it embarked on Operation Pillar of Defense, which was relatively restrained. But two years after that came Operation Protective Edge \u2014 the most brutal of its assaults on Gaza, which killed more than 2,200 Palestinians.\n\nThe decade-long siege of Gaza is an unparalleled collective punishment. Israel\u2019s methods, disproportionate under international law, are carefully planned and considered. At one point, the military justified restrictions on food imports into Gaza by calculating the number of calories a person there needed daily to survive.\n\nNo wonder living conditions have only gotten worse over the years. Gisha, an Israeli human rights organization, estimates that the number of Palestinians who were allowed to leave Gaza, including for medical treatment, averaged under 6,000 a month last year \u2014 less than half the monthly average for 2016 or 2015. A United Nations report was already warning in 2012 that Gaza would be uninhabitable by 2020, and matters have only gotten worse in the meantime.\n\nBut the fate of these almost two million human beings forced to live in a vast cage \u2014 most of them youngsters with no past, no present and no future \u2014 mainly because of Israel\u2019s inhuman policies, doesn\u2019t seem to touch the country\u2019s conscience. Israelis live in denial; they barely even talk about Gaza. Much of the local media, betraying its mission, hardly covers life there: No matter what, Gaza is simply characterized as a hive of terrorism and a constant threat to our security. \u201cGo to Gaza!\u201d is a common Hebrew curse.\n\nAfter the failure of the Camp David summit meeting of July 2000 and then the Second Intifada, in 2000-05, many Israelis lost both hope in peace and interest in the Palestinian tragedy. Israel has turned right, and nationalistic, even racist. Yet the truth is that Gaza is a disaster zone, and one of Zionism\u2019s greatest victims.", "title": "Opinion | Gaza: The Lesser Child of Israel\u2019s Occupation", "authors": []}

Those factors included the chief executives\u2019 tenure, characteristics of the firms (size, performance and risk), and the size and independence of the boards.\n\nThe authors added that their model accounted for the fact that compensation for chief executives and the number of women in the role had increased over time. \u201cOur results reveal that there is no significant difference between male and female C.E.O. compensation,\u201d they said.\n\nThe study also \u201ccasts doubt on the veracity\u201d of the previous studies showing that female chief executives were paid more. \u201cThe truth seems to be that, once relevant confounding factors are accounted for, male and female C.E.O.s earn similar compensation, which is what standard economic theory would suggest and most people would like to see happen in society,\u201d they said.\n\nOne of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role.

Forward this newsletter, share the sign-up page and tell people why you think it\u2019s worth joining our little email community.\n\nThe more this Letter grows, the more the conversation will deepen.\n\nNow for your answers to our questions about #MeToo in Australia, gender and where it\u2019s heading next, followed by stories of the week, and a call from our food critic for restaurant recommendations in Perth.\n\nWe Need More Female Leaders\n\nI think the #MeToo movement in Australia \u2014 which has gone after a couple of high-profile media personalities \u2014 has not been as visible or vocal as in the U.S.\n\nYou mention the defamation laws, which is one reason why, but I also believe it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have a strong female leader advocating for women\u2019s rights. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are some excellent investigative journalists exposing serious issues (Tracey Spicer, Kate McClymont etc.), but we don\u2019t have a Rose McGowan or Ashley Judd \u2014 someone who is willing to speak out not just about their own experience but about the broader discrimination and harassment issues facing women. As a result the #MeToo movement relies on investigative media stories for attention and when the news moves on, #MeToo gets left behind. I think the other constraining factor is a cultural one. Many Australians like to say \u2018we\u2019re nothing like the U.S.\u2019 For example we\u2019re not (or at least we think we aren\u2019t) as litigious, we don\u2019t love guns and our politics isn\u2019t as brash or cultlike (I\u2019m thinking of all the clapping when a politician gives a speech). This gives Australians an excuse to say #MeToo is really an issue for Americans, not us. I don\u2019t believe this, but it\u2019s a belief that sits below the surface for many. A local leader of the movement could address this. Gender progress here is the same as everywhere else. The #MeToo movement has brought to light the unacceptable and appalling behavior of many men. However, this reflects only what\u2019s above the surface. It\u2019s what\u2019s below the surface that needs to be addressed if we want real, long-lasting change. And what sits below the surface is the gendered way we treat girls (and boys) from the day they are born. We accept and excuse certain behaviors for boys (I\u2019m thinking of boisterous loud and aggressive behaviors). If as a society we can look at a behavior and say it is acceptable or not, and take the gendered bias away, then we would have a fairer world. Girls and boys will grow up expecting the same behavior from each other, and call each other out when they don\u2019t. Alas, I have grown up in a world that hasn\u2019t done this, and I see my 6-year-old daughter facing the same bias.\n\n\u2014 Pip Nagy\n\nRipples Not Tidal Waves\n\nIf the world thinks of us as a particularly macho country, it\u2019s the inertia of our popular cultural image. It\u2019s a \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 vision of Australia as rough-speaking, rugged, rural and masculine. But Australia is changed and changing, shedding its caricatures. Today, more than a third of Australians were born overseas. Two-thirds of us live in capital cities and women outnumber men in all but one of them. Not to mention Paul Hogan hasn\u2019t lived in Australia since last century. There will always be Australians who maintain and proclaim our so-called macho image. However for many, and for the majority of younger people, this image is an anachronism. Gender progress reflects this change, demonstrated in the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up conversations flourishing in Twitter feeds and public spaces. The global wave of accountability has had an impact beyond public panels and television specials. #MeToo has played first fiddle to several falls from grace in Australia, among them an iconic entertainer and a high-profile politician. It has infiltrated debates about national and institutional policy and civil and criminal law. If the ripples in Australia have not matched the tidal wave seen in the States, it may only be a matter of time until a critical mass of Australian voices joins the global conversation. For the moment, whether our hopes are too high or expectations too low depends on who is being asked the question.\n\n\u2014 Jill Masters\n\n#MeToo and Regional Australia\n\nWhat Francesca observed is the two Australias. Australia is a largely progressive, politically engaged, compassionate nation \u2014 #auspol is one of the most active Twitter discussions in the world. The community is highly reactive to issues of the day, cares a lot about public perception and the \u2018pub test,\u2019 and egalitarianism / equality (to the point of suffocating ambition and achievement, cf. \u2018Tall Poppy Syndrome\u2019) is one of Australia\u2019s strongest national values. We got right on board with #MeToo. We were primed to do so by a strong debate around domestic violence that had been riding high since Rosie Batty was Australian of the Year. In a way, our shift in psyche was not as severe as it was in other countries. Tracey Spicer trying to claim credit or ownership of it, and last week implying that it was a thing that happened in America to differentiate it from her Now campaign, has actually been quite infuriating and insulting to the many hundreds of thousands of Australian women who said #MeToo, including myself. But there are other parts of our culture, particularly in rural areas, that mitigate that liberation, and the fight against sexual and domestic violence. The tolerance of such violence parlays into the tolerance of Barnaby Joyce. I come from New England \u2014 it\u2019s my home electorate \u2014 and I know every square inch of it well. The University of New England has the highest rate of sexual harassment and assault of any university campus in the country. Smaller towns in the area like Inverell have domestic violence and sexual/indecent assault rates as much as two and half times the state average. There are few local supports for domestic violence and sexual assault victims. The communities are so small and social pressure so high that most crimes of this nature remain unreported. In the city, and even larger coastal towns, there is a refusal to accept such behavior; support services are provided; and #MeToo resonated strongly. #MeToo was heard in places like New England, but they didn\u2019t join in \u2014 to do so would have meant social death. With such small populations, spread out over such vast land spaces, you need your neighbors, you tolerate abuse, and you don\u2019t speak out about such troubles. You keep the peace so you can stay living in your town \u2014 the next town might be two or three hours\u2019 drive away, not 10 minutes, and there\u2019s certainly little to no public transport to get you out of town if you needed it. Given that, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that more young women than young men leave their rural communities and do not return.\n\n\u2014 Raphaella Kathryn Crosby\n\nThe Perils of Feminism?\n\nThe change in the role of women due to second-wave feminism in the 1960s is the key cause of Australia\u2019s negative birthrate and the aging of the population. On this basis feminism is biologically dysfunctional whilst patriarchality is biologically functional. Therefore the promotion of feminist sexual equality in politics, business and society in Australia is not the way for the greatest number of young women to find happiness in marriage and children or in the best interests of Australia. So how do we change our currently biologically dysfunctional culture to one in which the maximum number of young women can find happiness in marriage and children and restore a positive birthrate? I don\u2019t know the answer, but if there is one, I suspect it will come from women, not men \u2014 and from women born in the 21st century. In the interim, helping Australians understand the negative impacts of feminism and not supporting or promoting it further would seem a prudent course. When a society uses its young women for wealth creation, rather than procreation, it eats the seed corn of its future. As a result of feminism women are no longer pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen but now are increasingly well heeled and childless in the boardroom.\n\n\u2014 Paul McFadyen\n\nGendered Everything\n\nI am a junior in college in the U.S. and am currently studying in Australia for the semester, in Brisbane. Before I left, I was under the impression that the cultural norms of gender would be similar to what I had experienced in the U.S. \u2014 not perfect but actively seeking ways to improve itself for the most part, or at least in my opinion. News such as the legalization of gay marriage and the extent of the #MeToo movement here along with other stories you had mentioned convinced me of this. But the first thing I noticed when I got here was how gendered everything was. The floors of my dorm were gendered, my orientation week consistently paired people only in opposite genders, the police officer who came in to talk about sexual assault proposed that the girls play up their feminine stereotypes to trick the assumed sex-obsessed males in order to prevent rape. In my residential college of over three hundred people, I can only name one person who is openly gay. During dinner, one of the freshmen asked me if it was true \u201cif the United States really had people who didn\u2019t believe in male or female, and called themselves they instead\u201d as the rest of the table snickered. In general, I find that the men are overwhelmingly masculine and the women are overwhelmingly feminine in a polarizing sort of way. This is all while I take classes at the university in anthropology in which we talk openly about the same topics in gender and sexuality as I did in those classes back home. To summarize, I have found through living here that the external culture and internal culture of gender and sexuality have not quite aligned in the way I had assumed. This might just be the demographic I am most exposed to, or the city I am living in, but it truly has been quite surprising.\n\n\u2014 Ann Bisognano\n\n______", "title": "Gender and #MeToo in Australia: Where Do We Begin?", "authors": []}

Last month, Mr. Trump said drug dealers should be executed. The two men even had similar speech mannerisms, often saying the exact same sentence twice in rapid succession.\n\nFor a time, a George Wallace presidency was not an outlandish notion. He ran well on the American Independent Party ticket in 1968, capturing 13.5 percent of the popular vote and the 45 electoral votes of five southern states \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 plus a \u201cfaithless elector\u201d in North Carolina, a state won by Richard M.

In the run-up to this year\u2019s state elections in Bavaria, it too has been hardening its position on immigration and integration, explicitly to block the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known by its German abbreviation AfD.\n\n\u201cIf we talk and act in a manner that broad groups have painfully missed recently, we can render the AfD obsolete,\u201d said Alexander Dobrindt, who heads the Christian Social Union\u2019s caucus at the Bundestag.\n\nIn January, Mr. Dobrindt published his own conservative manifesto in the German newspaper Die Welt. The majority in Germany, he writes, thinks and feels \u201cb\u00fcrgerlich\u201d \u2014 a term often rendered in English as \u201ccivic,\u201d but in German, it also encompasses a sense of tradition, orderliness and normality. According to Mr. Dobrindt, the \u201ccivic\u201d majority is underrepresented in the public debate, which, he claims, is dominated by left-leaning opinion leaders. It is time, he writes, for a \u201cconservative revolution.\u201d\n\nBut what would be gained if the AfD vanishes yet populist thought seeps into mainstream politics?\n\nOn the one hand, the \u201cnew conservatives\u201d share some of the tangible policy positions held by the AfD \u2014 a reduction in immigration, repatriation of migrants, stronger domestic security policies. These are not new conservative policies per se, and they are a part of mainstream politics. But with the traditional right embracing them so loudly in the context of a resurgent far right, there\u2019s no question that the far right itself is gaining ground as an ideology. There\u2019s a new radicalism in the new conservatism.\n\nLike the AfD, the new conservatives see immigration not just as a practical problem that poses difficulties for the welfare system, integration, housing and security. Many frame it as an existential threat to Germany\u2019s national identity, and to \u201cthe Occident\u201d more broadly. \u201cExistential\u201d threats can legitimize extraordinary measures.\n\nMany new conservatives like to think of themselves as rebels against the Merkelian status quo. They often call themselves the \u201csilent majority,\u201d large in number but underrepresented in the country\u2019s news media and political institutions. It\u2019s an old trope, and not unique to Germany, but again, context matters \u2014 and in today\u2019s climate, it reinforces the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with our democratic system.\n\nThe implication is that the system does not recognize the true interests of society. It also suggests that the system can no longer be changed by democratic deliberation, but that a more fundamental opposition may be needed, and a deposing of the elites allegedly manipulating the system in their favor.

He wants to require both partners to attend what could be called Prenup 101.\n\nIt is far from something couples can take casually. Mr. Dungan has developed work sheets and quizzes to complement extensive counseling that lasts at least six months, though ideally closer to a year. He calls the whole process \u201conboarding\u201d \u2014 a far more welcoming description than \u201cdivorce planning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to say, \u2018We\u2019re in this together,\u2019 but then there\u2019s this big wrench that gets put in place,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if we looked at it as an opportunity and not this huge problem?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo this end, the work sheets ask open-ended questions about how people feel about money: \u201cWhat is money to me?\u201d \u201cWhat things matter most to me in life?\u201d \u201cWhy is it important to understand how each person is wired with respect to money?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey have homework assignments they need to do,\u201d Mr. Dungan said. \u201cSome are together, some are separate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut emphasis is put on the discussion, he said.\n\n\u201cPart of this is to recognize that this is not a romantic conversation,\u201d Mr. Dungan said. \u201cWe get that, but it\u2019s an opportunity for them to step into this and talk about their own family of origin and their own money story.\u201d\n\nMr. Dungan said his goal is to take the prenuptial agreement out of the conversation and present the couple with an opportunity to have an honest conversation about money. He wants them to learn if they are spenders, savers or sharers when it comes to money in their lives.\n\nAndrew, who comes from a prominent Midwestern family and asked that his last name not be used, said his family had been a client of Mr. Dungan\u2019s since he was a teenager. He\u2019s in his late 20s now and has been married for four years.\n\nHis wife became part of the family\u2019s financial discussions while they were dating. Still, when they got engaged and the process ramped up, the conversations were not easy.\n\n\u201cThere were things that got brought up that my wife and I never knew were bothering us,\u201d Andrew said. Mr. Dungan helped them ask about their attitudes toward money. \u201cIt allowed my wife and me to learn why this is important and to understand this isn\u2019t a \u2018me vs. you\u2019 thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe process took about six months until a prenuptial agreement was signed.\n\n\u201cIt can feel like you\u2019re against each other from the start,\u201d Andrew said. But in the end, he was glad they were both on the same page. \u201cIt lets you start your marriage on the right foot,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Dungan\u2019s method appeals to people who are confident and open enough to at least discuss money within their own families. That\u2019s usually how they know about him in the first place: as clients of his getting advice on wealth and inheritance.\n\nBut many prenuptial financial conversations are not well planned. More often, couples wait until weeks or even days before their wedding before talking about a prenuptial agreement \u2014 a hasty decision signed in what the industry calls \u201cthe shadow of the altar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCasting that kind of uncertainty on a wedding can dim the sunny days most couples expect. But such an approach can also have unintended ramifications.\n\nThe person who is being presented with the prenuptial agreement can feel unprepared or, worse, ambushed. As for the agreement itself, that kind of rush also increases the likelihood that whatever is signed will not hold up in court.\n\nPart of what makes a prenuptial agreement enforceable is a full disclosure of existing assets. To do this, there needs to be time for both parties to understand what is involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to challenge a prenup in New York,\u201d said Jacqueline Newman, managing partner at the New York law firm Berkman Bottger Newman & Rodd. \u201cBut if it\u2019s literally thrown to the person in the shadow of the altar, courts consider all of that. It\u2019s not smart on the part of the person who wants a prenup to give it to someone last minute.\u201d\n\nInherited assets and family gifts are generally protected in divorce proceedings. But if, say, income from a trust was used to pay for the family\u2019s lifestyle, it could be subject to division in a divorce, said Silvana D. Raso, managing partner at Schepisi & McLaughlin, a law firm based in New Jersey.\n\nThe same, she said, holds true for a family business, even if a new spouse is only partly involved in managing it and receiving income from it. Both concerns can be handled in a properly drafted agreement, but doing so takes time and discussions.\n\nMs. Newman, however, noted that for the so-called non-monied spouse, a prenuptial agreement can offer access to funds supporting the couple\u2019s married lifestyle that would not be available in a divorce, such as otherwise untouchable inheritance funds.\n\nThere is consensus on what makes a good prenuptial agreement: time to discuss all the issues and draft a document that is fair to both sides and perhaps even has provisions to change over time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut getting to that document can cause lasting problems in a family if the process is not handled with care. Mr. Dungan\u2019s classes attempt to fend off emotional distress, much of which can revolve around how families talk \u2014 or don\u2019t talk \u2014 about money.\n\nAlison Comstock Moss, chairman and chief executive of Paul Comstock Partners, which advises clients on a total of $2.2 billion in assets, recalled a client who told his future son-in-law that he would not get a dime from the family if the marriage ended. The son-in-law, who was himself financially successful, had not planned to ask for anything from his wife\u2019s family in the prenuptial agreement.\n\nYears later, the marriage is happy, but the two men still do not get along. \u201cKnowing all the parties involved, I don\u2019t think the intent was to be nasty,\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cI think they got bad advice and the way they communicated with each other was really hurtful.\u201d\n\nA better way to have handled the situation, she said, would have been to ask a simple question about expectations, which would have allowed the son-in-law to speak his mind.\n\nBut an approach like that requires planning, education and openness about financial expectations, which may not be possible if the focus is on the agreement itself.\n\nMr. Dungan said that his process still led to the same end \u2014 a prenuptial agreement \u2014 but that it got there in a way that required more thought.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not robotically moving through this process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a dynamic that allows them to have the best outcome.\u201d", "title": "Getting Married?

Stanton, with the leverage of a no-trade clause, pushed back, and eventually a trade with the Yankees was worked out.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since their series under a dome in Toronto, the opening-pitch temperature for nine of the Yankees\u2019 10 games has been under 54 degrees. They have had three games postponed by rain or snow, all of which has limited their time outdoors for batting and fielding practice.\n\nIf that deprived Stanton of getting used to his new surroundings at Yankee Stadium, his acclimation to New York has also taken place on the fly.\n\nWhen the Yankees left spring training in Tampa, they flew to Atlanta for an exhibition the next night, March 28, and went directly to Toronto for the season opener. It was only after that series when Stanton arrived to New York.\n\n\u201cIt was a load, getting oriented to New York and trying to get his condo set up,\u201d Stanton\u2019s father, Mike, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s your natural instinct when you move in somewhere to try to get it set up as quickly possible. But in retrospect, he didn\u2019t have a lot of down time.\u201d\n\nBoone said the logistics of setting down roots in a new city are part of a ballplayer\u2019s life, even if it is something that Stanton is doing for the first time since his rookie season in Miami. Soon, he said, Stanton would be settled into a new routine and there will be comfort in that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the gig, part of the way we\u2019ve lived our whole life,\u201d said Boone, who switched teams five times in his final nine seasons in the majors. \u201cLook, I want to get into the flow of the season as I know the players do \u2014 the routine of it \u2014 as much we can.

Stanton has now struck out in eight of his first nine Yankee Stadium at-bats.\n\nBut as Manager Aaron Boone pointed out, the benefits that come from players like Stanton, Judge and, to a lesser extent, Sanchez are often accompanied by strikeouts.

Last season with the Nittany Lions, he accounted for 1,903 yards from scrimmage and 21 touchdowns, and averaged 28.4 yards per kickoff return with two touchdowns.\n\nBefore moving outside Allentown, Pa., Barkley grew up in the Bronx, where he cheered for the Jets, whose logo is tattooed in red on his father\u2019s forearm and who might have been his ideal destination.\n\nIn a different year, perhaps. But not this one, not with the Jets (again) committed to drafting a quarterback. Aside from the Jets, only three other teams have failed to make the playoffs in the last seven seasons: Chicago, Tampa Bay and Cleveland. The Bears and the Buccaneers identified their franchise quarterbacks in recent drafts, and the Browns, after years of dysfunction, believed they found theirs on Thursday, when they took Mayfield.\n\nThe Jets, after a failed free-agent pursuit of Kirk Cousins, had been on the clock at No. 3 for nearly six weeks. Though they knew they would be drafting a quarterback, they did not know which one. They gained that position with a gambit as aggressive as it was desperate, surrendering picks No. 6, 37 and 49, plus a second-rounder next year, to Indianapolis for the right to move up three spots.\n\nPreparing to take his third quarterback in four drafts with the Jets, Maccagnan could not afford to sit at No. 6 and risk other needy teams, like Buffalo or Arizona, maneuvering ahead of him (the Bills and the Cardinals moved up Thursday night to take quarterbacks, with Josh Allen going to Buffalo at No. 7 and Josh Rosen to Arizona at No. 10). Maccagnan needed to be comfortable with, at worst, his third-rated quarterback.\n\n\u201cWe felt very good about the players that would be there,\u201d Maccagnan said.\n\nDarnold joins the Jets at a pivotal time in the A.F.C.

The Jets\u2019 chances of disrupting New England\u2019s divisional supremacy, of contending season after season, depend on Darnold\u2019s progress and aptitude for maximizing the talent around him.\n\nDarnold will get an opportunity to ascend the depth chart at once, competing with last year\u2019s starter, 38-year-old Josh McCown, and Teddy Bridgewater, whom the Jets signed in free agency after he missed most of the past two seasons because of a knee injury.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to throw him in there,\u201d Coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re not going to hold him back, either.\u201d", "title": "Giants Select Saquon Barkley; Jets Choose Sam Darnold", "authors": ["Ben Shpigel"]}

Mr. Giuliani plans to try to work with Mr. Mueller to come up with a way to question Mr. Trump that both sides are comfortable with.\n\nThe addition of Mr. Giuliani comes at a particularly tumultuous time for the president. Last month the president\u2019s lead lawyer, John Dowd, quit the team after he determined the president was not following his advice. For much of the past month, the team has been led by Mr. Sekulow, who has had to assemble a new group of lawyers to deal with the issues in New York and another team to confront Mr. Mueller.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Mueller has been pressuring Mr. Trump to sit down for an interview. The president, who initially said he was eager to answer Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions under oath, is said to be more skeptical of an interview in the wake of the raid on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office.\n\nAfter Mr. Dowd quit, many well-known lawyers turned down the opportunity to join the president\u2019s legal team. Some said that they did not believe Mr. Trump would listen to them and that their firms did not want to be associated with the president. But after the raid on Mr. Cohen, many more lawyers have become interested in working for Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the matter. The lawyers believe the government overstepped its bounds by executing a warrant at a lawyer\u2019s office and have contended the government violated the attorney-client privilege between Mr. Cohen and his clients.\n\nMr. Trump negotiated the discussions to have Mr. Giuliani join his team with Mr. Giuliani directly, a person close to the process said. Mr. Trump had repeatedly offered Mr. Giuliani the job of attorney general during the transition, but Mr. Giuliani turned it down because he wanted to be secretary of state.\n\nMr. Trump turned to Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, to be attorney general, but has publicly criticized Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Sessions should be protecting him from the inquiry.\n\nSome close to the president believe he could try to replace Mr. Sessions with Mr. Giuliani in the coming months, although Mr. Giuliani would face an extremely difficult confirmation hearing in the Senate. When Mr. Giuliani sought the secretary of state job, Trump advisers, including the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, raised concerns about his business dealings and paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations.", "title": "Giuliani to Join Trump\u2019s Legal Team", "authors": []}

He untied her ankles and took her to the living room, where he held a knife to her throat and raped her. He stayed in the house, drinking beer, for several hours; before he left, he demanded her wedding band and engagement ring, warning her he would cut her fingers off if she couldn\u2019t remove them. He also took her state photo identification, which would haunt her for years to come.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t identify him because he had a ski mask on the whole time,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Dell, 63, said. \u201cBut he had my photograph and my driver\u2019s license, so I always had this fear that he could be standing next to me at the grocery story and I\u2019d have no idea. That was always a fear.\u201d\n\nShe could hardly believe that he had been living in Citrus Heights, so close to where he had attacked her. For a long time, she could not talk about what happened. Ms. O\u2019Dell said her sister had provided comfort, moving in for a year after the attack because Ms. O\u2019Dell was afraid to be alone while her husband was at work. She said she shared her story freely now because she felt more empowered.\n\n\u201cI was 22 years old and there was a lot of shame and there wasn\u2019t empathy for victims. And I felt embarrassed. I felt judged. I didn\u2019t feel like a victim back then.

There\u2019s power in being this way.\u201d\n\n\u2018I Was the Victor\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nBy the fall of 1977, the man who was then known as the East Area Rapist had been terrorizing women in the suburbs of Sacramento for more than a year. Margaret Wardlow, then 13, had been captivated by the case, reading about the methodical ways he had sought and attacked his victims.\n\nHer mother, who was then 55, tried to assure her that they were too old and too young to make for appealing targets. But one night in November, Ms. Wardlow awoke to a man holding a flashlight in her face, whispering angrily. Initially, she thought it was a neighbor playing a joke to get her out of bed before school. Then, she saw a clock showing it was 2:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cThen I knew clearly: This is the East Area Rapist,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew he got off by frightening people and I thought the less enjoyable time he has here the better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKnowing that he had yet to kill anyone, Ms. Wardlow said she had focused on getting the rape over with. As he tied her up and blindfolded her, he asked if she wanted him to kill her mother or her. She recalled responding coolly, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nWhile the attack was over within minutes, he stayed in her home for more than an hour. He had placed plates on her mother\u2019s back, warning her he would kill her if he heard the plates rattling \u2014 just as he had warned the husbands of other women he raped.\n\nHe had entered through the sliding glass door upstairs and left through the front door, Ms. Wardlow said, turning on the kitchen sink and stove fan for ambient noise. She recalled hearing her mother screaming for help. Soon after, a neighbor arrived with a shotgun. Investigators later confirmed Ms. Wardlow\u2019s hunch that she had been attacked by the serial rapist, who used the same method over and over again.\n\nA couple of years after the attack, Ms. Wardlow and her mother moved to Orange County, Calif., where murders that the authorities believed to be linked to the same suspect had occurred. Her mother urged her to go to therapy, but she refused. Ms. Wardlow said that to this day she has not spoken of her attack to a professional.\n\nIt was only a year and a half ago, after Ms. Wardlow had searched \u201cEast Area Rapist\u201d on the internet, that she realized the serial rapist who had attacked her had become a serial killer and was never caught.\n\n\u201cI always felt like I triumphed,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I controlled what happened as much as I could, I had influence over that night.

Her younger brother, then 12, found their bodies in their bedroom when he went to mow the lawn and heard their alarm clock going off. At first he thought nothing of it, but he grew concerned when it continued to ring.\n\nThe killer had sexually assaulted Ms. Smith and bludgeoned both husband and wife to death with a log from the fireplace. Their killing sparked enormous fear and unrest in the small town. Even with her own loss, Ms. Carole expressed sympathy for the surviving rape victims, who have had to carry their trauma with them for so many years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you do after you\u2019ve been raped and terrorized,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who are alive, they are the ones that really suffered.\u201d\n\nMs. Carole, now 56, said that after the murders she, as the oldest sibling, took methodical steps to manage the logistics involved, which she said helped give her a sense of order. It wasn\u2019t until a year later, while at college, that she began experiencing panic attacks and difficulty focusing. Now living in Santa Cruz, she said she has seen a counselor about the trauma and that she and her brothers are living full, productive lives.\n\nStill, she expressed immense relief that the killer was finally caught.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a narcissist and a psychopath.

As a result, it lagged its closest competitors last year.\n\nNo longer. Goldman booked $10 billion in revenue for the quarter, its highest total in three years and a 25 percent increase over the same period in 2017.

Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.\n\nDespite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.\n\nBut the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers.

An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police.

Nothing was more central to Republican identity between 2010 and the rise of President Trump. But when given the chance, Mr. Ryan couldn\u2019t get the House to pass repeal. The bill the House finally sent to the Senate wasn\u2019t a repeal but a dilution. It never became law, either.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Ryan, a longtime budget hawk, was incapable of returning the House budget process to regular order. And rather than reducing spending and the deficit, he increased both. Worse, Mr. Ryan is at odds with the president and a majority in his party on immigration and border control. The bill for those contradictions and failures has finally come due.\n\nIn order to inspire the necessary loyalty and camaraderie to pass legislation effectively, House Republicans need to know that the speaker has their back. But Mr. Ryan didn\u2019t. When Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, made a spurious allegation against Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, Mr. Ryan backed Mr. Schiff and sidelined Mr. Nunes for months. Mr. Nunes was subsequently cleared. It\u2019s no wonder that Mr. Ryan couldn\u2019t hold the conference together on big votes. Republicans want and deserve a speaker with the courage and tenacity of Mr. Nunes \u2014 one who supports his troops when they\u2019re under fire.\n\nIntellectually and politically, Mr. Ryan is part of the Reagan Revolution\u2019s third generation. And as it is with many entrepreneurial families, it is the third generation that squanders the family fortune. They don\u2019t know how it was created, and in their own lives they have known nothing but wealth. Reaganism remains a rich legacy, but Republicans can\u2019t live off the interest.\n\nThe predictable response from Democrats will be that Mr. Ryan couldn\u2019t square his principles with the reality of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. That might score a quick rhetorical win, but it misses the bigger political picture. America is in the midst of a major political realignment that is redefining both the left and the right. Mr. Trump\u2019s sudden ascendance to power is a symptom of the larger trend and also a catalyst for the intellectual and political reformation that is currently underway on the right, which has led to the announced departures of standard bearers of the ancien r\u00e9gime like Senator Jeff Flake, Senator Bob Corker and now Mr. Ryan.", "title": "Opinion | Good Riddance, Mr. Speaker", "authors": []}

High-rises replaced gardens, two or three to a single plot of land. Our house was sought after \u2014 not for its architectural value, but because developers saw it as sitting on prime land along the Nile. Second to buying it out ourselves, which we couldn\u2019t afford, placing it in the hands of a buyer who would preserve it was the best we could do, and that task became a mission for my mother, pitting her against her family in a standoff that lasted 30 years.\n\nIn my early 20s, as the country was beginning to reform economically and I was starting to write, I moved downstairs, inhabiting my grandmother\u2019s floor, and my brother and I took on the cause of protecting the house ourselves. We searched widely for possible patrons who might make our home their own or turn it into a cultural center, a library or a museum. The interest that came, when it did, was always from abroad. Egyptian businessmen and patrons of culture seemed intent on investing in new developments, suburbs and multimillion-dollar modern homes, but not the center of the historic city, not the heritage already there.\n\nFor 30 years the garden bell rang with real estate agents promising \u201crespectable\u201d buyers. Every deal fell through, and it seemed like the house might stay in this limbo forever. I wrote the house into my novel in 2014: It was the only true-to-life character in the book, and the only thing in my life, and the neighborhood, that seemed unchanged through the revolution of 2011, as our hopes for real change after Mubarak\u2019s fall first rose only soon to be shattered. Ours was the last of family homes still inhabited by its original owners, and everyone remarked how it was the one thing that they could depend on always being there.\n\nAnd yet, when I wrote it into fiction, I conjured the moment where we might, indeed, pack it up.\n\nOn April 1, the day that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s re-election was confirmed, we handed the house to its new owners, who had circled it for two years, admiring it. My mother had at last found her buyer, a woman whom she felt would be the next best custodian to the house and its legacy. We walked through its every room together on that last day, and once the handover papers were signed in the garden, I returned inside alone to close all the doors, windows and shutters. I then led myself out of the main door, locking it behind me.\n\nThose final moments walking out, as well as the months that preceded \u2014 as we sifted through nearly 80 years of a family history, packing and throwing out and giving things away \u2014 felt like a closing, the end of an era, both for my family and for modern Egypt, independent since 1922. The house now has foreign owners, and the country \u2014 perhaps at its most conservative and repressive \u2014 is a far cry from what I ever expected it to become. The latest elections came and went, for me, unacknowledged, too farcical to consider. What might have been a turning point, a political opening, became an end.\n\nMy mother\u2019s new apartment overlooks her old garden; from her balcony, I see what used to be mine. The new owners haven\u2019t moved in yet, but their groundsman and his family occupy the basement of our old house, and spend their days sitting on the plastic garden chairs we left behind. When the sun is setting, shutters left open offer a glimpse into my brother\u2019s childhood bedroom; I forgot to roll them down, and the room\u2019s white muslin curtains still hang.

Said he built houses for a living, and that was about all the small talk between us. He liked the rifle. I needed the cash. We shook hands, and off we went.\n\nThere is rarely a moment when I\u2019m not within reach of a firearm. When I lie down at night, there is an old single-shot New England Firearms Pardner leaned against the headboard, a loaded Smith & Wesson M&P Shield pistol on the nightstand. When I sit on the couch to work on an essay or a novel, there is a CZ 75 pistol on the coffee table. When I go to town for groceries, one of those two pistols is concealed inside my waistband.\n\nWhere I live in the mountains of North Carolina, I am not alone. With fewer than a dozen guns in the safe, I wouldn\u2019t even be considered a gun nut. Most of my friends have concealed-carry licenses and pistols on their person. If there are 10 of us in a room, there are most likely 10 loaded firearms, probably more, with a few of us keeping backups in ankle holsters. Rarely do we mention what we carry. We don\u2019t touch the guns or draw them from their holsters. They are unseen and unspoken of, but always there.\n\nI can\u2019t remember a time in my life when I wasn\u2019t around guns. When I was a kid, there was a gun rack hanging on the wall in the living room. My father kept a single-shot .410 and an old bolt action .22, small-game guns, though he didn\u2019t hunt anymore. I can remember watching older boys shoot skeet at a junkyard in the woods behind my house, my fingers plugged in my ears while orange clays turned to smoke against a backdrop of post oak and poplar. I can remember the first time my father taught me to shoot a rifle, how he had me sit on the concrete driveway and use my knee for a rest, aiming for a cardboard target in a honeysuckle thicket across the road. I think I was 8 or 9. I pulled the stock in too high on my shoulder, and craned my neck awkwardly to line up the iron sights. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but I knew the rules: Always assume a firearm is loaded. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. Know your target and what\u2019s beyond it.\n\nI come from a country people whose culture was destroyed by bulldozers and buildings. My father\u2019s family settled in and around Charlotte in the late 1700s. As a child, I would ride around with my grandmother in her light blue Oldsmobile. Where Winn-Dixies and Food Lions stood, she remembered fields where she worked tobacco and picked cotton. I grew up in a tiny holdout spot of country where I ran through a pasture of chest-high field grass to fish a farm pond most evenings, where just a mile down the road my uncle still kept a kennel of hounds to run rabbit each fall.\n\nGuns were often a bridge between father and son. But my dad didn\u2019t keep a .38 Special on the bedside nightstand like my best friend\u2019s father down the street. I never walked into the house and found him cleaning and oiling a dozen pistols at the kitchen table the way I did with my next-door neighbor\u2019s dad. For my family, guns had always been a means of putting food on the table. My father never owned a handgun. He kept nothing for home defense.\n\nPhoto\n\nI was in eighth grade the first time I had a gun put to my head. It was December 1997, a year and four months before Columbine, at my middle school in Charlotte.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA teacher named Mr. Madison sent me and three other boys outside to look for stuff to put under a microscope \u2014 rocks, tree bark, empty snail shells, anything we could find. The school was located in a neighborhood three miles from downtown. A sewer line ran parallel and cut a wide trail through the woods between two residential streets. We were at the edge of the clearing. I saw someone walking up with a hood over his head. When he got close, he pulled the gun and jammed it into my temple.\n\nI can remember that it was a little snub-nosed revolver, a brushed-steel frame. I can remember what it felt like pressed into the side of my head, how my heart raced when I went for my wallet, how I couldn\u2019t breathe. I had $50 my grandmother sent me for my birthday. My mom was going to take me to a skateboard shop after school to buy a new deck. There have been times I wondered what might\u2019ve happened if it\u2019d been like every other day, if I hadn\u2019t had a dollar to my name. If my wallet had been empty, would he have just walked away or become so frustrated that he pulled the trigger? Luckily, I had the money, and he took the $50 and ran.\n\nWhen he was gone, the four of us rushed for the classroom and tried to tell Mr. Madison what happened, our words broken by shattered breath, him screaming: \u201cSlow down! Slow down!\u201d The rest of the day we recounted our story over and over to the principal. In the end, what happened was swept under the rug. My parents said the school was probably trying to keep the story off the news.\n\nWhen I was 14, I couldn\u2019t imagine the impact that robbery would have on the rest of my life. I couldn\u2019t foresee a grown man feeling uncomfortable when he was corralled by passers-by on the street, an unnerving anxiety turning him to stone when he was surrounded by strangers. I remember an afternoon in my early 30s at a therapist\u2019s office describing the years that followed that incident, and she speculated that I surrounded myself with the people I did as a form of protection. There\u2019s a part of me that thinks that\u2019s too easy an answer, that it\u2019s passing the buck instead of taking responsibility. But for those next few years, I ran around wild.\n\nI sat in the back of a police cruiser praying the officers wouldn\u2019t pop the trunk on the car parked in front of my truck, knowing my friend had a shotgun and a quarter pound of weed sitting on the spare. I rode in the passenger seat while a buddy rolled down the window and fired a pistol into the night, blowing off steam after a breakup, empty casings spitting against the windshield. I dropped to the ground as gunfire rang from a car at a bonfire party. I pushed friends behind the brick foundation of a house as a shootout erupted over pills. There were times when someone could have easily been shot and killed.\n\nThe second and last time I had a gun put to my head it was by the police. After a drunken fight, I left a friend\u2019s apartment to walk five miles and sleep on the porch of a buddy\u2019s house across the river. I was walking down the side of Wilkinson Boulevard in Belmont. I was carrying a shoe box. I saw a police cruiser pass me and make a U-turn at a stoplight up ahead. When the Crown Vic came back, the driver jumped the median and next thing I knew there were multiple cars, lights flashing, officers ordering me to the ground.\n\nThey had their guns drawn. There was a K-9 unit, and the German shepherd wouldn\u2019t quit barking. I was lying flat on my stomach, and one officer came forward and put his knee in my back, his service weapon pushed into the base of my skull. They let the dog close enough that I could feel him barking against my ear. They said I matched the description of someone who\u2019d burglarized some houses nearby. They asked what was in the shoe box, and I stuttered, \u201cPapers.\u201d They asked if they opened the box if there was anything inside that would hurt them. With my face in the grass and the officer\u2019s weight making it hard to breathe, I was so terrified that I couldn\u2019t mutter a single word. I just shook my head, and they opened that box to find nothing but a stack of notebook papers, a pile of half-assed stories I\u2019d written. They told me I could get up, and I stood there trembling while they apologized. They gave me a ride across the river and dropped me off at the Mecklenburg County line, told me they were sorry but they couldn\u2019t take me any farther.\n\nPhoto\n\nI moved to the mountains not long after that. As soon as I arrived in Jackson County, I knew I\u2019d never leave. A hundred and fifty miles west of where I grew up, I found a community that reminded me of my grandmother, where folks still kept big gardens and canned the vegetables they grew. They still filled the freezer with meat taken by rod and rifle \u2014 trout and turkey, dove and rabbit, deer, bear, anything in season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI keep a close-knit group of friends here, most of whom are at least 20 years my senior. Our generational difference is erased by a shared passion for wilderness and time spent in the field with gun in hand. This past Christmas, one of the men I hunt with, a man we call Son in Law, handed down a Model 94 Winchester to his grandson. The grandson would be the fourth generation to hunt with that rifle. A few weeks later, the boy took that .30-30 lever action into the field and killed his first deer with it \u2014 the same as his uncle, his grandfather and great-grandfather. Those types of things are rare now, even in places like Appalachia.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest member of my hunting camp \u2014 me 34, everyone else in their mid-to-late 60s, a few on up past 70. Among these men, there are centuries of experience gathered around the campfire each night. After more than 40 seasons wandering the same woods, they\u2019ve come to know the land intimately. They toss around names \u2014 the Owl Boxes, the U.F.O. Hole, the Refrigerator Stand \u2014 places they\u2019ve killed deer for decades. They tell stories about men who have died, hunters like Goat Man, who carried an onion in his pocket and plowed down trees in his beat-up Bronco; or Hawkeye, who ran moonshine and damn near drank a boy to death after the kid slapped a sack of weed on the poker table and declared, \u201cBoys, that\u2019s the shit that killed Elvis.\u201d The old men talk, and I listen.\n\nI killed my biggest deer to date on the 2nd of November from a tree one of those men sent me to. Fifteen feet up a hickory, I watched a tree line at the edge of a clear cut. I heard heavy footsteps and eased around the right side of the tree for a look, and there he stood. The buck walked to my left, and I slipped behind the trunk, shouldered the rifle and balanced the fore end on a tree step I\u2019d augured into the opposite side for a rest.\n\nHe was broadside when I slid the cross hairs onto his shoulder. The clear cut, strewn with downed timber and studded with sawed stubs, was too rough to track and drag, so I didn\u2019t want to risk a shot for heart and lungs and have the deer run a hundred yards. I wanted to drop him where he stood. Pin his shoulders together and buckle him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nJust before the deer strolled behind a cedar sapling, I touched the trigger, and the .308 blew apart the morning. A hundred and fifty grains of copper-jacketed lead hit just behind the shoulder and blood-shot the backside to pudding. The buck stooped forward and sprinted, back legs driving him over tangled ground. He made it 40 yards before he crashed. From my stand, I could just make out the white of his stomach through the brush. I watched his ribs rise with each breath, that breathing slowing, slowing, then gone.\n\nThere is a sadness that only hunters know, a moment when lament overshadows any desire for celebration. Life is sustained by death, and though going to the field is an act of taking responsibility for that fact, the killing is not easy, nor should it be.\n\nI climbed down a half-hour later but didn\u2019t walk straight to the deer. Instead I went to the place where I shot him, a yard shy of that cedar sapling, and followed the blood trail to where he lay. He was a big-bodied eight-point that would feed me for a year. I knelt there and ran my hands across his coat. It took nearly an hour to drag him back to the trail, another half-mile from there to the truck.\n\nA few days later, I was driving back home from hunting camp in McCormick, S.C., with the head of that eight-point in a cooler in the truck bed, the rest of the deer hanging to age at the processor. On a long straightaway, I passed a state trooper driving in the opposite direction. In the rearview, I saw him slam on the brakes and make a U-turn in the middle of the road, blue lights flashing. I was running just under 60 in a 55 and didn\u2019t think there was any way he was pulling me over.\n\nThe 9-millimeter I always carry was loaded and concealed on my side. Until that moment I\u2019d never been pulled over while carrying a concealed weapon. I knew the protocol. I knew what I was legally obligated to say. But I was nervous as hell as the trooper stepped out of his cruiser, situated his campaign hat and approached the side of my truck.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was a young black man with braces on his teeth. He looked to be in his early 20s, had kind eyes and was built like a linebacker. He asked for my license and registration, and I told him I needed to inform him that I had a concealed-carry license and that there was a weapon on my person. He asked where the gun was located, and I told him roughly 4 o\u2019clock. He asked if I could get to my wallet, and I told him the pistol was pretty close to my back pocket. There was a moment of hesitation when he considered what to do next. Then he told me to move slowly as I took my wallet from my pocket.\n\nWhen the trooper had my license and registration, he went to his cruiser. In a few minutes, he came back to the window and issued me a warning for speeding. I asked if there was anything I could\u2019ve done differently to make him more comfortable when he first approached the truck. The trooper told me what I\u2019d said was fine. He said that some officers might have been uncomfortable with where the pistol was located, being holstered near my wallet, but that he felt we had a good rapport. Depending on the officer, some might have asked me to step out of the truck so they could remove the weapon. He smiled and told me: \u201cBut this is South Carolina. Most every car I pull over has a gun.\u201d\n\nAs I headed toward the mountains, all I could think about was Philando Castile, the young African-American man who had a permit to carry and was shot to death in his car in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter by a Minnesota policeman after notifying the officer that he had a weapon. All I could think about was how things might have been different if the situation was reversed and that young black state trooper with braces had been behind the wheel, a white trooper cautiously approaching the car. It was impossible not to think that if I were black, I\u2019d be too scared to carry a gun. It was impossible not to recognize how gun culture reeks of privilege.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast summer I drove back to Charlotte to visit my father for his birthday. While I was there, I went into a Cabela\u2019s store in Fort Mill, S.C., to buy him a new depth finder for his fishing boat. After I found what I was looking for, I headed across the store to see if there were any good deals on ammo.\n\nThere were floor displays of AR-15s, and probably a hundred or more other rifles and shotguns for anyone to walk up and hold. I watched a kid about 8 or 9 pick up one of those ARs and shoulder it to the center of his chest. He held the gun awkwardly, cocked his head hard to the side, squeezed one eye closed to aim and dry-fired the weapon. I watched two men, presumably his father and grandfather, smile and laugh, then break out their cellphones to snap a few pictures.\n\nI remembered how when I was his age, I used to love going to the sporting-goods section of Walmart to look at fishing lures and camouflage clothes. I\u2019d walk over near the register and push the manual turntable on the curio display to look at all the rifles and shotguns. There were usually a few big game guns \u2014 a gray stock Remington 783 in .30-06, maybe a Marlin 336 lever action \u2014 a couple of pump shotguns, a single shot .410 or 20-gauge. There were always Ruger 10/22s and Marlin Model 60s, the .22LRs kids unwrapped when their grandfathers gave them their first rifles for a birthday or Christmas. There were always guns, but nothing like the assault weapons that line the shelves today.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s how I was raised and the types of firearms my family kept, but the idea of owning a rifle designed for engaging human targets out to 600 meters just never interested me. I keep a Savage 10 in .308 to hunt whitetail and hogs. I have a CZ 920 that\u2019s absolute hell on a dove field. I have a handful of .22 rifles that I use for plinking at the range and hunting squirrels and rabbits each winter. Then there are the weapons I keep for defense \u2014 the shotgun by the bed, the pistols \u2014 firearms whose sole purpose would be to take human life if I were left with no other choice. I\u2019ve witnessed how quickly a moment can turn to a matter of life and death. I live in a region where 911 calls might not bring blue lights for an hour. Whether it\u2019s preparation or paranoia, I plan for worst-case scenarios and trust no one but myself for my survival.\n\nMy friends see no difference between the guns I own and their ARs. One or two of them rationalize assault weapons the same way I justify what sits by my bed. When I ask if those rifles are really the best option for home defense, they joke about the minute hand of the doomsday clock inching closer to midnight. They post Instagram photos of Sig Sauer MCXs and tac vests loaded with extra magazines, their bug-out bags by the door as they wait for the end of the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut a majority defend their ARs the same way I defend the guns I use for plinking and hunting. They say they own them because they\u2019re fun at the range and affordable to shoot. They use the rifles for punching paper, a few for shooting coyotes. Every weekend they fire hundreds of rounds from custom rifles they\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars building. They add bump stocks and Echo Triggers to increase rates of fire and step as close to Title II of the federal Gun Control Act as legally possible without the red tape and paperwork. They fire bullets into Tannerite targets that blow pumpkins into the sky.\n\nNone of them see a connection between the weapons they own and the shootings at Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Aurora, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland. They see mug shots of James Holmes, Omar Mateen, Stephen Paddock, Nikolas Cruz \u2014 \u201ccrazier than a shithouse rat,\u201d they say. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been that rifle, he\u2019d have done it with something else.\u201d They fear that what starts as an assault-weapons ban will snowball into an attack on everything in the safe. I don\u2019t believe that politicians are going to ban ordinary guns or overturn the Second Amendment, but I understand their reasoning because I understand what\u2019s at stake. I think about that boy picking up that AR in Cabela\u2019s, and I\u2019m torn between the culture I grew up with and how that culture has devolved. There are changes I know must come, changes to what types of firearms line the shelves and to the background checks and ownership requirements needed to carry one out the door. And there is an unrelenting fear of what could be lost \u2014 a subsistence culture already threatened by the loss of public land, rising costs and a widening rural-urban divide; the right of individuals to protect their own lives and the lives of their families.\n\nA few days after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, I sat down with a buddy over coffee at the firehouse where he works. The news was on in the background. I told him I\u2019d be fine with an assault-weapons ban. He cut a look in my direction as if I\u2019d absolutely lost my mind. I asked him why anyone needs to own an AR, an AK, an SKS. He said that the question is irrelevant, that the reason doesn\u2019t supersede the right. I could feel my blood pressure rising and my face getting warm. I could see in his eyes that he was equally agitated. Despite everything we have in common, despite the fact that he\u2019s my best friend and we were going squirrel hunting in a few days, the two of us fundamentally disagree. Someone came into the room and changed the subject, and I could sense that he was as thankful as I was. As sad as it is to say, the silence is easier. While the two of us sat there sipping coffee, there were kids on the television in the background, high school survivors who were willing to say what we are not, and I was ashamed.\n\nOne recent afternoon I rode with my girlfriend, Ashley, an hour east to Asheville. It was the first week of March, but a warm spell had the willows green along the creek in the pasture at our house. It was one of those pretty, late-winter days with bluebird skies when the trees are still naked on the mountains and you can see every shadow and contour of the landscape. Knowing how I hate going to the city, she bribed me with a trip to the Field & Stream sporting-goods store if I would ride along.\n\nAs we pulled into the parking lot, I thought about the last time we were there, back before Christmas. Ashley didn\u2019t grow up with guns as I did. She\u2019d never owned one before I gave her a shotgun to keep by the bed when I\u2019m away from home. For a year or so, she\u2019d been considering a pistol. She\u2019d held dozens of models but still hadn\u2019t decided on anything.\n\nWe were at the back of the store looking in the glass case at 1911s. All of a sudden, her eyes got big and she raised her hands then ducked behind me and grabbed onto my arm. I turned and stared down the aisle where a kid who looked about 18 was aiming an AR-15 the salesman had handed him. The muzzle was pointed in our direction. Ashley was terrified. I\u2019ve been at the counter enough to know the predicament \u2014 wanting to shoulder a rifle to test the feel but having nowhere sensible to aim. The kid lowered the rifle and went back to talking to the salesman, neither seeming to notice us standing there, Ashley frozen behind me.\n\nOn the way out, she just kept saying: \u201cHe was a kid. He looked like he should\u2019ve been in high school. What does a kid need a rifle like that for? What does anybody need a rifle like that for?\u201d And the truth was, I didn\u2019t have an answer. The truth is, there are guns I feel justified in owning and guns I feel belong on battlefields. I know the reasons my friends give for owning these weapons, and I know that their answers feel inadequate to me. I know that part of what they\u2019re missing or refusing to acknowledge is how fear ushered in this shift in gun culture over the past two decades.\n\nFear is the factor no one wants to address \u2014 fear of criminals, fear of terrorists, fear of the government\u2019s turning tyrannical and, perhaps more than anything else, fear of one another. There\u2019s no simple solution like pulling fear off the shelf. It\u2019s an intangible thing. I recognize this, because I recognize my own and I recognize that despite all I know and believe I can\u2019t seem to overcome it. I\u2019m sure that part of why I carry is having a pistol put to my head when I was 14. I\u2019m sure that part of it is having hidden behind walls while shots were fired. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of those two things coupled with headlines and hysteria, the growing presence of mass shootings in American culture.\n\nI don\u2019t like being in places where I can\u2019t find the exits. I don\u2019t like crowds and being surrounded by more people than I can keep my eyes on. For the most part nowadays, I stay at the house. When I have to leave, I slide my holster into my waistband before I put on my boots. When a book tour sends me out of North Carolina, 36 states honor the concealed-carry license in my wallet. Unlike a lot of those who carry, I don\u2019t buy into that only-way-to-stop-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-a-good-guy-with-a-gun bravado. I have no visions of being a hero. Instead, I find myself looking for where I\u2019d run, asking myself what I would get behind. The gun is the last resort. It\u2019s the final option when all else is exhausted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Ashley and I left the store, we headed toward the Levi\u2019s outlet, where she planned to buy a new pair of jeans. The walkway narrowed, and the sidewalks were filled with people and noise. Even though I knew the risk was remote, my mind raced with all those questions of what I\u2019d do if someone suddenly opened fire. As we walked, I could feel the pistol holstered on my side, the weight of my gun tugging at my belt. The fear was lessened by knowing that there was a round chambered, that all it would take is the downward push of a safety and the short pull of a trigger for that bullet to breathe. I felt safer knowing that gun was there.", "title": "Gun Culture Is My Culture. And I Fear for What It Has Become.", "authors": ["David Joy"]}

In total, 10 men were arrested in connection with the murders, two of whom testified against the others. Five pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison. The remaining three, including Mr. Joyce, were tried, convicted and hanged.\n\nThe victims \u2014 a married couple, Bridget and John Joyce; two of their children, Margaret and Michael; and John\u2019s mother, Margaret \u2014 were found in their home in Maamtrasna, a remote community at the border of Mayo and Galway counties. Reports from the time \u2014 some of which included cruel descriptions of the Irish-speaking residents of that rural area \u2014 suggested that a firearm and some bludgeoning were involved.\n\nMr. Joyce and two others convicted of participation in the murder were hanged on a cold December morning in Galway. The New York Times reported that Mr. Joyce protested his innocence so persistently that he appeared to have prolonged his own execution:\n\nBefore the drop fell Myles Joyce spoke in Irish, as follows: \u201cI am going before God. I was not there at all and had not hand or part in it. Lord, forgive them that swore against me.\u201d He continued to reiterate his innocence to the end. The drop fell at 8:25 o\u2019clock simultaneously for all three of the men. Myles Joyce alone struggled slightly, there being some hitch with the rope. His dying speech was delivered with much vehemence. He was still speaking when the drop fell.\n\nA doctor who examined the bodies said Mr. Joyce struggled for minutes as the rope strangled him to death.\n\nIt was shown that after the rope had been adjusted around his neck he turned and addressed the reporters, thus disarranging the rope. The jury severely censured Marwood, the hangman, for his carelessness.\n\nIreland was not yet independent from Britain \u2014 that would not happen until 1921 \u2014 and the murders took place at a time of simmering conflicts over land rights and independence.\n\nThat made people wonder whether the murders were connected to the unrest, ultimately raising the profile of the case, Mr. \u00d3 Cuirre\u00e1in said. Instead of being tried in nearby Galway, Mr. Joyce was taken all the way across the island, to Dublin, for his trial. English was the language of the court.\n\nProfessional Irish translators would have been easier to find in Galway, but in Dublin, a police officer was called upon to serve as a translator, Dr. Howlin\u2019s research showed. But he mostly translated Irish into English and not the other way around, effectively leaving Mr. Joyce in the dark. The trial was also compromised by intense media interest, procedural problems, a lack of input from key witnesses and testimonial inconsistencies.\n\n\u201cThe other two men convicted alongside him swore that he was innocent, and the approvers who had given evidence against him retracted their statements following his death,\u201d Dr. Howlin said in her paper. Two years after the trial, The Times reported that one informer said he had been asked to lie by a crown solicitor. Mr. \u00d3 Cuirre\u00e1in also found that a lord lieutenant of Ireland, Earl John Spencer, seemed to have been involved in bribing witnesses.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like fiction because of the twists and turns,\u201d Mr. \u00d3 Cuirre\u00e1in said. \u201cBut unfortunately it was true, and innocent people were condemned to death.\u201d", "title": "Hanged After a Trial He Couldn\u2019t Understand, and Pardoned 136 Years Later", "authors": []}

Stanton has confirmed in interviews that the design of the primary antagonist \u2014 the onboard autopilot computer nicknamed \u201cAuto\u201d \u2014 came straight from the cold, unfeeling red eye of HAL 9000.

In addition to its smiley-face readout, Gerty has an all-seeing camera lens that exudes the same detached menace as HAL\u2019s does, and the soft (though historically often subtly menacing) tones of Kevin Spacey\u2019s voice grant Gerty a similar reassuring presence as well.

Fox; Warner Bros.\n\nThe writing staff for this immortal sitcom never met a pop-culture reference it didn\u2019t like, and the writers have returned to \u201c2001\u201d on multiple occasions. In the Season 3 episode \u201cLisa\u2019s Pony,\u201d an ape with Homer\u2019s face causes a ruckus during a riff on the film\u2019s \u201cDawn of Man\u201d sequence after he reclines against the monolith \u2014 and tips it over. \u201cDeep Space Homer,\u201d from Season 5, sends Homer into orbit, where he gobbles potato chips in zero-gravity in a motion recalling the docking scene from \u201c2001\u201d (think \u201cBlue Danube\u201d). That same half-hour also swipes the often-imitated match-cut Kubrick created between a spinning bone and a spinning space station: In \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the moment comes when Bart tosses a marker into the air that then cuts to an image of a satellite to conclude the episode.

To create an appropriate sense of momentousness for the occasion, Burton positions a towering Wonka bar in the place of the monolith from \u201c2001,\u201d on an outcropping of rocks surrounded by screeching primates.

AMC; Warner Bros.\n\nAs part and parcel of his obsession with verisimilitude, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator Matthew Weiner sampled liberally from the pop culture of the 1960s, and the Season 7 episode \u201cThe Monolith\u201d isn\u2019t shy about borrowing from Kubrick. Technology and the rapidly changing world it represents frighten the ad executives of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, and visual cues in the episode liken the sudden appearance of a giant computer to that of the towering black monolith of \u201c2001\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a harbinger of their creeping obsolescence.

When Stiller\u2019s empty-headed Derek Zoolander and the equally vacuous Hansel (Owen Wilson) are tasked with extracting files from a computer, they\u2019re utterly stumped. They poke around searching for a power button, getting more and more agitated until they begin beating the console, at which point the unmistakable strains of Strauss\u2019s \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d creep in and just like that, they\u2019re apes in the \u201cDawn of Man.\u201d (Stream \u201cZoolander\u201d on HBO, rent it on Amazon or iTunes.)\n\n\u2018Community\u2019\n\nScenes from \u201cCommunity\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d (inset). NBC; Warner Bros.\n\nAlways dense with allusion, this meta-sitcom emulated one of the strangest and most surreal scenes of \u201c2001\u201d for its third season premiere. Greendale College\u2019s resident smart-aleck, Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), hallucinates that he\u2019s transforming into the elderly pariah, Pierce (Chevy Chase). It\u2019s a clear reference to Dave\u2019s arresting confrontation with his withered future self in the blindingly white room. While the scene passes in under a minute, the show\u2019s creator, Dan Harmon, still made room for a shot-by-shot imitation of the series of claustrophobic color-inverted eyeball close-ups.

New Line Cinema; Warner Bros.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson likes to wear his influences on his sleeve, and for this staggering drama about crisscrossing lives in Los Angeles, he paid clear homage to Kubrick with a restaging of one scene from \u201c2001.\u201d While the infirm game show producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lays on his deathbed moaning in agony, his compassionate nurse, Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), paces about, trying to make him comfortable. Anderson\u2019s composition follows that of Kubrick\u2019s meeting between Dave and Future Dave, and the \u201cZarathustra\u201d needle-drop drives the point home.

Miramax Films; Warner Bros.\n\nAnother master synthesizer of his influences, Martin Scorsese looked to Kubrick\u2019s vision of the future for one shot in this vision of the past. In it, he borrows a bit of iconography for a charged moment in which a butcher\u2019s knife thrown in the air stands in for the bone lobbed by the apes during the opening of \u201c2001.\u201d The attention to detail is so fine that the rotations of the knife even match those of the bone, each edit calibrated just so. (Look for it at about 1 hour 46 minutes 50 seconds into the Netflix streaming of \u201cGangs.\u201d) (Stream \u201cGangs of New York\u201d on Netflix or rent it on Amazon or iTunes.)\n\n\u2018Sunshine\u2019\n\nScenes from \u201cSunshine\u201d and \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d (inset). Fox Searchlight Pictures; Warner Bros.\n\nThe director Danny Boyle recreated another \u201c2001\u201d sequence down to the tiniest detail in this film when he stranded three space travelers (including a still-green Chris Evans) in an airlock, their only hope of escape being a jump to an adjacent one. Their perilous jet to the next airlock may as well have been stenciled from a similar set piece in \u201c2001\u201d that forces Dave to scramble for his life outside the craft. The rhythm of the cuts, the careful contrasts of the scale of each wide and tight shot \u2014 it all comes from Kubrick\u2019s playbook.

What Marx did achieve, however, through his self-styled materialist thought, were the critical weapons for undermining capitalism\u2019s ideological claim to be the only game in town.\n\nIn the \u201cCommunist Manifesto,\u201d Marx and Engels wrote: \u201cThe bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers.\u201d\n\nMarx was convinced that capitalism would soon make relics of them. The inroads that artificial intelligence is currently making into medical diagnosis and surgery, for instance, bears out the argument in the \u201cManifesto\u201d that technology would greatly accelerate the \u201cdivision of labor,\u201d or the deskilling of such professions.\n\nTo better understand how Marx achieved his lasting global impact \u2014 an impact arguably greater and wider than any other philosopher\u2019s before or after him \u2014 we can begin with his relationship to Hegel. What was it about Hegel\u2019s work that so captivated Marx? As he informed his father, early encounters with Hegel\u2019s \u201csystem,\u201d which builds itself upon layer after layer of negations and contradictions, hadn\u2019t entirely won him over.\n\nMarx found that the late-18th-century idealisms of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte that so dominated philosophical thinking in the early 19th century prioritized thinking itself \u2014 so much so that reality could be inferred through intellectual reasoning. But Marx refused to endorse their reality. In an ironic Hegelian twist, it was the complete opposite: It was the material world that determined all thinking. As Marx puts it in his letter, \u201cIf previously the gods had dwelt above the earth, now they became its center.\u201d\n\nThe idea that God \u2014 or \u201cgods\u201d\u2014 dwelt among the masses, or was \u201cin\u201d them, was of course nothing philosophically new. But Marx\u2019s innovation was to stand idealistic deference \u2014 not just to God but to any divine authority \u2014 on its head. Whereas Hegel had stopped at advocating a rational liberal state, Marx would go one stage further: Since the gods were no longer divine, there was no need for a state at all.\n\nThe idea of the classless and stateless society would come to define both Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019s idea of communism, and of course the subsequent and troubled history of the Communist \u201cstates\u201d (ironically enough!) that materialized during the 20th century. There is still a great deal to be learned from their disasters, but their philosophical relevance remains doubtful, to say the least.", "title": "Opinion | Happy Birthday, Karl Marx.

Roderick MacArthur. That structure provides some financial stability but also allows the younger MacArthur to wield more control over the publication, which was on the verge of folding before he helped rescue it in 1980.\n\nThe venerable monthly has had unstable leadership since Lewis H. Lapham left Harper\u2019s in 2006, after a 28-year run as its top editor. First there was Roger Hodge, who was fired after a disagreement with Mr. MacArthur in 2010. Next to hold the position was Ellen Rosenbush, who was replaced by Christopher Cox in 2015. Mr. MacArthur ended up firing Mr. Cox after he had been in the job a scant three months, and Ms. Rosenbush returned to duty on an interim basis. She was followed in February 2016 by Mr. Marcus, an early Amazon employee and the author of \u201cAmazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.com Juggernaut.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking for a doormat at this point,\u201d Mr. Marcus said of Mr. MacArthur.\n\nThe news of Mr. Marcus\u2019s firing was first reported by Publisher\u2019s Marketplace.\n\nThe essay by Ms. Roiphe attracted attention before it was published, while it was going through the fact-checking process. Concerned writers and editors began a Twitter campaign warning that the article would reveal the identity of the main creator of a crowdsourced spreadsheet that named roughly 70 men in the media industry who were said to have acted in a predatory manner toward women.\n\nThe online complaints intensified, arguing that the safety of the spreadsheet\u2019s creator would be jeopardized by the publication of Ms. Roiphe\u2019s essay. Before the social media campaign had died down, the writer Moira Donegan revealed that she was the main person behind the list in a first-person story for New York magazine\u2019s web vertical The Cut.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMs. Roiphe\u2019s essay had a similarly troubled pre-publication history inside the Manhattan offices of Harper\u2019s. The idea began, Mr. Marcus said, with the publisher, who suggested that the magazine \u201crun a contrarian piece on #MeToo movement.\u201d The editor countered that he was uncomfortable with such an assignment, because of the magazine\u2019s \u201clongtime reputation as a gentleman\u2019s smoking club.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expressed my opposition in the beginning, but I was overruled by the publisher,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s the publisher\u2019s prerogative to essentially assign a piece.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Marcus said that the magazine approached \u201cone or two\u201d writers, who passed on the idea, before Ms. Melucci, the Harper\u2019s publicist, reached out to Ms. Roiphe. He added, \u201cWe can quibble over who technically assigned the piece. She\u2019s a publicist and doesn\u2019t have the power to assign anything. You could say she assigned it with Rick\u2019s permission. She had no role in the editing of the piece.\u201d\n\nMs. Melucci suggested that she got involved in the editorial process only because of unusual circumstances at the magazine. \u201cMaybe think about the fact that the publicist had to assign stories because the editor didn\u2019t have ideas?\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe that\u2019s how bad it was.\u201d\n\nMr. Marcus disagreed with that, saying that during the discussion last week that ended with his firing, \u201cthere was no complaint about my failure to generate story ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe editorial process was breaking down,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s Rick\u2019s magazine, but usually the publisher does not intercede during the editing process. The piece was widely disliked by the entire staff, but I want to stress that they worked with absolute professionalism on it, whatever they thought of it.\u201d\n\nMs. Melucci said that she did not understand Mr. Marcus\u2019s objection to the essay. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe because it was a good story? It was the most successful story we\u2019ve had in a couple years. He may have been against it, but it was good for the magazine.\u201d\n\nIn addition to discussing the Roiphe article last Friday afternoon, Mr. Marcus said that Mr. MacArthur, the publisher, had expressed his disappointment that Harper\u2019s had not been reaching more readers. The magazine\u2019s circulation, now at 120,000, has been in decline for years. Mr. Marcus said that the publisher\u2019s resistance to bolstering the website and expanding readership engagement by hosting events impeded opportunities for growth.\n\nMs. Melucci said that Mr. MacArthur had no comment for this article. She also declined to comment on whether the magazine had interviewed prospective editors. Ms. Rosenbush, listed as editor at large on the Harper\u2019s masthead, will oversee the publication on an interim basis, Ms. Melucci said.\n\nMr. Marcus described being fired as \u201cpainful,\u201d but said he still had respect for Harper\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s still a magnificent publication,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cI share Rick\u2019s pride in what he has accomplished there, but I think the anxiety and increasing sense that he needs to grab the reins editorially are going to make it hard for anybody who stands in that job.

Any flat-out judgment, in either direction, is bound to be schematic and skewed. The facts on the ground are that with two or three exceptions \u2014 Uruguay, Chile and perhaps Costa Rica \u2014 no country in Latin America has ever been spared massive doses of corruption. Standing institutions alone have never functioned effectively either in wiping it out, diminishing it noticeably or taking action against impunity for corruption or human rights violations. Regarding the latter plague, for which the region has a dismal reputation even today, international cooperation of one sort or another has proved indispensable for bringing criminals to justice or at least naming and shaming them for generations to come. The best example lies probably in Guatemala, but also in Argentina, where former presidents of the Junta were indicted and jailed for human rights violations.\n\nThere appears to be no choice but to place any attempt to deal legally, democratically and effectively with the lack of punishment above other considerations: institution-building, national sovereignty, political stability, short-term economic performance. Developments over the past few years in all the region\u2019s countries are positive, hopeful ones. In the end, they will strengthen civil society, representative democracy, the rule of law and economic progress. They do not weaken institutions; they help to transform them and make them function.\n\nSimilarly, taking corruption to a supranational level that must be addressed through international cooperation is not an abdication of sovereignty; it is a desirable change.\n\nIn fact, this is perhaps the most imaginative and productive route for the fight against corruption. It is, by definition, a transnational phenomenon: People who steal money hide it far from where they stole it.\n\nThe Odebrecht scandal, the Panama Papers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States and the European Union\u2019s equivalent legislation are all indicators of the need and the tradition of taking on corruption beyond strictly national borders. The inclusion of an anti-corruption chapter in the new Nafta currently being negotiated by Mexico, the United States and Canada is a step in the right direction.

It began at Montreal\u2019s opulent St. James Hotel before migrating to his handsome Edwardian house, which, he notes, channels the red chinoiserie of Diana Vreeland\u2019s lush New York apartment.\n\n\u201cWhat I have been feasting on all these years is nostalgia \u2014 a nostalgia for the childhood that I didn\u2019t end up having,\u201d he added.\n\nWaiflike and compact, wearing a hoodie and with a tattoo of Dumbledore (of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fame) on his left arm, Mr. Dolan peppers his sentences in English with words like \u201cprolix\u201d and \u201cepistolary,\u201d and only occasionally switches into French to emphasize a point. He used part of his earnings as a child star to take Berlitz classes in English.

It is perhaps an occupational hazard for a director who has been variously compared to Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen and the poet Arthur Rimbaud.\n\nHe made his first film, \u201cI Killed My Mother,\u201d a Freudian-tinged, semi-autobiographical film about a gay teenager who clashes with his mother, after he dropped out of college at 17. As one producer after the other rejected it, he scraped together money from his child-acting gigs to make the film himself, at age 20, eventually winning international acclaim. When he later noted wryly that Orson Welles, who made \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d at 25, was a \u201clate bloomer,\u201d the critics pounced, and he turned to Twitter to explain that he had been joking.", "title": "He Wanted to Escape His Childhood.

There, Eze befriends his cousin, Pius (Chinaza Uche), a professional scammer who sends phishing emails, among other deceitful business pursuits.\n\nMr. Okoro wrote the story with Andrew Long, a fellow Howard University alumnus. As they developed the script, they were guided by the director Spike Lee, who mentored Mr. Okoro at N.Y.U. (Mr. Lee is also an executive producer of the film.)\n\nThe project was long-gestating. \u201cThis is classic Faraday,\u201d Sheldon Chau, the film\u2019s cinematographer, said in a phone interview. \u201cHe comes up to me and he asks me, \u2018Sheldon, what are you doing summer 2017?\u2019 This is in 2014.

A Nigerian-American raised in Maryland, Mr. Okoro was sent to live with his extended family in Lagos for his first two years of high school, in the early 2000s.\n\nLike his character, Eze, he reluctantly left his friends and home. \u201cI definitely resented it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe eventually learned to appreciate the new culture; one of his hopes is that the film will resonate with other young Nigerian-Americans who have felt disconnected from their roots.\n\nBut shooting a movie in the West African city brought a host of unforeseen challenges.\n\n\u201cWe shot during the end of the rainy season,\u201d said Mr. Okoro, who was familiar with the region\u2019s climate but hadn\u2019t bargained for all the difficulty it would present in filming. \u201cThere were some days where we\u2019d go to set at 6 a.m., and it\u2019d rain at 6:30 and flood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe week before filming began, the crew arrived to a space meant to double as a police station onscreen, but it, too, was flooded. They didn\u2019t end up using that location, though not because of the flooding; as at several other sites, the owner decided at the last minute that despite a signed contract, filming would no longer be allowed there.

Several of his collaborators were peers from N.Y.U. To help them navigate, they hired artists from the prosperous Nigerian film industry, known as Nollywood. Most of the crew members were Nigerian, and the American heads of creative departments were paired with Nigerian artists.\n\n\u201cIt just became apparent that all the departments needed a partner to show us the proper way to do things,\u201d Ari Fulton, the costume designer who met Mr. Okoro at N.Y.U., said in a phone interview.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Ms. Fulton, the assistance came from Olaogun Opeyemi, a Nigerian costume designer and the film\u2019s costume supervisor, who helped make nuanced choices. One example is a red hat worn by Pius, the cousin, that\u2019s an adaptation of an Igbo cap. Ms. Opeyemi helped fill out the history of the cap, which younger Nigerians have adapted for more casual use.\n\nAnother learning experience was realizing that despite the size of the budget, financial decisions still had to be carefully considered.\n\n\u201cThe million dollars just flies,\u201d said Mr. Chau, the cinematographer. He described the days after winning the grant, when he and Mr. Okoro would fantasize about using elaborate film gear. But they quickly realized that they were being unrealistic; after all, their budget, while several times higher than the $150,000 or $200,000 they\u2019d initially hoped to shoot the movie for, was still modest for a feature film.\n\n\u201cWe went back to pretty much our initial approach,\u201d Mr. Chau said. \u201cIt was a humbling experience.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Chau also noted that while Mr. Okoro was the ostensible winner, the money had a trickle-down effect, bolstering the professional portfolios of his young collaborators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe profiles of all of us came up,\u201d Mr. Chau said.\n\nThe pressure trickled down, too.\n\n\u201cIf someone hands you a million dollars, they expect you to turn out an amazing product,\u201d Ms. Fulton observed. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing to carry on your shoulders.\u201d\n\nMr. Okoro has carried it for a year.\n\nThe morning after the film was finished \u2014 the sound mixed, the color corrected \u2014 less than two weeks before the film\u2019s April 24 premiere, the director was standing in a Tribeca restaurant where this year\u2019s award finalists were scheduled to pitch their films.\n\nAfter exchanging greetings with two of the new judges, the actor Griffin Dunne and the comedian Ilana Glazer, Mr. Okoro took a seat, waiting for the new finalists to appear.\n\nOn the floor at his feet sat a hard plastic carrying case he\u2019d brought with him.

It remains unclear if Judge Wood will continue to preside as the matter moves forward.

Engaging her in a game of cat-and-mouse, the lawyers had at first described Mr. Hannity merely as a \u201cprominent individual\u201d who was embarrassed to be connected to the Cohen investigation.\n\nBut after another lawyer \u2014 representing news media outlets \u2014 stepped in to argue that embarrassment was not sufficient grounds to keep the name a secret, Judge Wood decided she agreed. When Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers pushed back, Judge Wood was blunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m directing you to disclose the name now,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd so the lawyer did.\n\nAlthough the moment passed with a burst of audible gasps, Judge Wood\u2019s measured approach \u2014 not raising her voice, but not backing down \u2014 showed a side of her that lawyers in her court know well.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s relevant to this case is that she\u2019s so calm and levelheaded,\u201d said Robert B. Fiske, Jr., a former United States attorney in Manhattan who has known Judge Wood since the 1980s. \u201cBoth sides, I think, would be very happy to have her as the judge.

There is that essential education \u2014 for the child and the family \u2014 about what A.D.H.D. means. There\u2019s educational testing, supports and accommodations in school, behavior techniques and routines at home, especially around schoolwork as kids get older. \u201cYou have lists, and you have incentives, and the star charts,\u201d Dr. Carlson said.\n\nFor parents, this means trying to provide structure, to give positive feedback and set consistent limits, all worthy goals for any child. But frustratingly, Dr. Bertin said, A.D.H.D. itself makes all those interventions much more stressful for everyone, and \u201cwhen parents are feeling swamped and overwhelmed it\u2019s really hard to do a lot of things that are recommended in taking care of A.D.H.D.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s medication. The medication helps many struggling children, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t organize you,\u201d Dr. Carlson said. On the other hand, \u201cit focuses you, it decreases your impulsivity, it helps your mood regulation so you\u2019re less volatile,\u201d and all of that may help with the struggles and frustrations of academic work and family life.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re talking to a child psychiatrist who believes in treatment,\u201d Dr. Carlson said. She tells parents that she likens refusing medication to refusing to wear glasses. \u201cI can say, I refuse to wear glasses, I am pathologically opposed to glasses, so I\u2019m going to have to get an aide, I\u2019m going to have to have someone read to me and I can make people make the print large and I\u2019m going to need a chauffeur,\u201d she said. \u201cIf all you have to do is put the glasses on and that takes care of a lot of the problem, then for God\u2019s sake put on the glasses!\u201d\n\nFamilies should not expect simple answers, or short-term solutions. Parents have to take care of themselves, and pay attention to the family dynamic, looking for ways to help everyone thrive. Look for areas of life where the child is successful and for ways to spend positive time together, Dr. Bertin suggested. Make sure the child is getting all the appropriate interventions at school, and look for resources to help with the home side of academics.\n\nAnd watch for sibling issues. It may not be healthy for a child who does not have A.D.H.D. to be cast in the role of the \u201cgood child,\u201d he said.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "If one thinks back to the semi-forgotten satire of the British \u201960s, shows like \u201cThat Was the Week That Was\u201d and the \u201cBeyond the Fringe\u201d skits helmed by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Alan Bennett, the first thing that is striking is the delicious comic tension between the wartime generation and the generation that followed. The comedy is driven by the onetime solidity of archaic British types: Colonel Blimps and academics with plummy accents, cap-tipping proles and Middle Englanders with lips so stiff they can hardly talk. But that seemingly solid tapestry of social orders melted away into nothingness almost overnight. Barnes sets his tale in its twilight, among what he calls \u201cfurrow-dwellers,\u201d the torpid English middle classes, but he refrains from deriving much comedy from it. His Gordon Macleod is a drunken brute who slams his wife\u2019s face into the doorjamb.\n\nImage\n\nNarrating the first section of the novel, Paul is filled with rage for this hateful caricature of a man, though this is entirely unsurprising since nothing complex or sympathetic is offered on behalf of the luckless and cuckolded Gordon. It might have occurred to Paul at some point that a 19-year-old doing the deed with your wife under your own roof might inspire a little chagrin, but Paul is himself \u2014 and purposefully, I think \u2014 a self-righteous adolescent who never quite sees it this way, for all his grandstanding about his own shame. When asking himself, in retrospect, how much he understood about love at 19, he intones, \u201cA court of law might find \u2014\u201d\n\nNo, sympathy and vitality are reserved for the women in Paul\u2019s telling, and indeed the author\u2019s. There are shades here of Sarah, Graham Greene\u2019s heroine in \u201cThe End of the Affair.\u201d Susan is, without question, the character linchpin of the novel, and she is rendered touchingly. Miraculously, she shines through her lover\u2019s philosophizing about love and memory, about which he has little original to say. She has spirit. The young man and older woman begin a hesitant and fumbling sexual liaison whose sacrilegious tenderness is, however, never quite incarnated by Paul\u2019s recollection of it. Take her ears, at which he marvels. In an early moment of their lovemaking, he remembers: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we were in bed and I was rummaging and rootling around her body, into every nook and cranny, every overexamined and underexamined part of her, that, crouched above, I swept back her hair and discovered her ears.\u201d One wonders at his language here. Rummaged and rootled? Was she really enjoying such a feverish examination? This makes him sound like a stamp collector going over his latest finds rather than an awe-struck adolescent losing his virginity. But this is Barnes\u2019s point, I assume. \u201cStrange as it may seem,\u201d Paul implausibly reflects just before the episode of the ears, \u201cI never reflected on our age difference.\u201d\n\nTeenage boys do lose their cherries to much older women (and they do so in the garden suburbs south of London), but it\u2019s rare that they never reflect on doing so with a woman nearing 50 with a husband and two daughters in tow. Nor do they tend to set up house with them. Still one could argue, after all, that this is the Emmanuel Macron story, with the cruel difference that Paul goes on to become not the leader of a major European nation but an obscure loser after eloping with his mistress and utterly failing to live happily ever after. For the darkness of the story only invades you in its last hundred pages. Years later, Paul settles down alone in the countryside to run something called the Frogworth Valley Artisanal Cheese Company and acquires a taste for reading lachrymose agony columns in the local newspaper. He also bakes. He not only loathes the memory of Susan\u2019s husband but most men to boot, finding them boastful, oafish and predatory, both beastly and comical. As for himself, he is by his own account an \u201cabsolutist for love.\u201d In other words, he is somehow less human than the man he still hates.\n\nAs \u201cThe Only Story\u201d proceeds, Barnes slips in and out of the first-, second- and third-person voices. Sometimes, but not always, with subtle effect. Near the beginning of the second section, which explores Paul and Susan\u2019s uneasy cohabitation, the slip into the second person heralds a nice gearshift into Paul\u2019s self-questioning; Barnes has a skillful command of tone and its moral implications, when he chooses to exert it. In the more hardened third person at the end of the book, the narrator has Paul recall a public service ad about AIDS in which it is suggested that when two people have sex they have sex with all their previous partners, and at once the ruminations become interesting.

It wasn\u2019t ideal, but I was pregnant again and grateful for all the help I could get, even if it meant witnessing my parents\u2019 occasional glares when my father came to visit, charging in the door despite the barking of my mother\u2019s Chihuahua.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give your dog back to the shelter before he bites someone and you get sued?\u201d he\u2019d snap. As he strapped Sylvie into her stroller to take her to the park, he\u2019d warn, \u201cTell your mother that letting raccoons live in the crawl space under her house will spread disease and is disgusting.\u201d\n\nYet eventually he began picking up treats for my mother\u2019s barking dog. To my amazement, the tension between my parents began to abate, particularly when they both zoomed in on Sylvie, a magnet with her bright red hair and contagious giggle.\n\nMaybe I should have seen the shift coming. As a psychologist, I know about the profound therapeutic impact of exposure therapy \u2014 when a person chooses to repeatedly face an uncomfortable stimulus rather than avoid it. For example, if someone hates public speaking, rather than dodging opportunities to grab a microphone, she would actively pursue chances to perform.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Now, anxiety researchers understand that the mechanism of change is creating new learning; in other words, instead of the body relaxing in the face of something difficult, the mind expands to develop healthier appraisals.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not always easy to persuade a person to approach something that distresses them. I find that it helps to remind my patients of what they most want in life, and then have them link facing their fears to achieving those higher aims. As for my parents, I know that they both deeply savor the opportunity to offer love and wisdom to their grandchildren. Our period of living in limbo forced them to learn to linger in the service of that intention.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs social scientists predict, repeated exposure led to improved understanding and a better quality of life. When the holidays rolled around, my mother suggested that we invite my father. By that time, Sylvie was 2 and we had a newborn son, Eli, named after my grandfather. The night of our family dinner, my mother was focused on perfecting short ribs; I was trying to get Eli to sleep and we were all absorbed in Sylvie\u2019s singing. There was no space for whispered words of resentment. My father brought a bottle of his favorite sparkling grape juice and loudly blessed the children. Dinner was uneventful, besides the fact that for the first time in decades, my parents were sitting together at the aged wooden dining table they had shared years before.\n\nWhen Adam and the kids and I finally moved to our own place a few months later, I invited my father to our first Shabbat dinner. \u201cDo you want to come over?\u201d I asked my mom. \u201cWill it be weird for you if Dad\u2019s there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my ex-husband,\u201d my mother replied. \u201cHe\u2019s my co-grandparent.\u201d And so I asked them both again. And again. I don\u2019t cook, so my mother tends to bring a cooler filled with multiple courses. If dinner is set for 6, she\u2019ll breeze in around 6:30, but the food is always delicious. My father recites the blessings and sits across from my mother, occasionally observing, \u201cIt\u2019s nice of your mom to bring you food.\u201d Sometimes, they chime in together with comments like \u201cSylvie, sit down,\u201d or \u201cThat toy is dangerous for Eli.\u201d\n\nRecently, Adam mentioned that my father had purchased my mother a ticket for a benefit for my daughter\u2019s school. He found out because a school administrator had called to ask what to do about the seating arrangements. We chuckled about our modern family but I was touched.\n\nMy mother and father have taught me that it\u2019s possible to pivot; that it\u2019s never too late to learn to be flexible, with intention and practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice of your mom to provide a home for those raccoons,\u201d my father said with a smile, as we all sat at a table together for another holiday dinner. \u201cMost people would get rid of them. She feeds them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been here for years; they don\u2019t bother me,\u201d she told him. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the family.\u201d", "title": "He\u2019s No Longer My Ex-Husband, He\u2019s My Co-Grandparent", "authors": ["Jennifer Taitz"]}

This is, for instance, the fourth time he has worked with Roger Michell, who directed his breakthrough play, the psychiatric-hospital-set \u201cBlue/Orange\u201d in 2000. \u201cThere\u2019s one collaborator who really gets you and you get them, and there\u2019s something about that chemistry,\u201d he said of Mr. Michell. \u201cYou have to trust them implicitly.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMood Music\u201d is not a #MeToo play \u2014 not directly. Written and programmed before allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein, there\u2019s nothing sexually untoward between Mr. Penhall\u2019s protagonists, played by Ben Chaplin and Se\u00e1na Kerslake. Their relationship is as platonic as it is vitriolic, but in picking at the power dynamics of a creative industry, it feels entirely on point.\n\nStories of sexism in the music industry are rife \u2014 like the male critical response to Joni Mitchell or Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s recent complaints about ceding credit to her male collaborators. In February, an academic study by Stacey L. Smith of the University of Southern California found that, of the 600 most popular songs in the past five years, just 12.3 percent were written by women. Female producers were even more rare: sometimes as little as 2 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite that, Mr. Penhall, who started his career as a cub music reporter (\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in a room with a rock star,\u201d he said), doesn\u2019t believe the music industry is \u201cinherently patriarchal.\u201d Rather, he blames commercialism: \u201cYou\u2019re selling to a mass audience, and a mass audience isn\u2019t necessarily forward thinking. The market is domineering and brutal and coercive.\u201d\n\nThe effect is to turn people into products \u2014 particularly female artists, whose personal lives become part of the package. \u201cIt\u2019s not just monetizing talent, it\u2019s monetizing trauma,\u201d Mr. Penhall said. \u201cThat\u2019s true of every artist, whether you\u2019re Picasso or Miley Cyrus, but I think it\u2019s more acute with songs because it\u2019s more naked. The whole industry has exploited heartbreak and sex.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Old Vic is on something of a roll \u2014 its musical \u201cGirl from the North Country,\u201d with songs by Bob Dylan, won two Oliviers this month, and Mr. Warchus said it would \u201ccertainly\u201d come to New York \u2014 but it\u2019s also dealing with the fallout of its own #MeToo moment. Until 2015, it was run by Kevin Spacey, one of the first people to face accusations of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThough Mr. Warchus stressed that the issue in this instance was about \u201ca person rather than an institution,\u201d he believes \u201cMood Music\u201d cuts to the issue\u2019s core. \u201cThe sexual side of things is the sensational side, the headline, but it\u2019s not really the interesting side of any of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really do need to have a hard think about how we deal with power, because people are always going to have power over others.\u201d\n\nPlenty of creative industries feed on hierarchical distinctions. \u201cIt happens in our world all the time,\u201d Ms. Kerslake said. Actors end up kowtowing to producers and directors. \u201cThe funny part of our job is that you actually have to give over control sometimes.\u201d\n\nPlaying such a toxic relationship onstage is a challenge of its own. Mr. Chaplin, who took on the producer part when Rhys Ifans dropped out for \u201cfamily reasons,\u201d recognizes the responsibility that comes with representing an abuse of power. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to appear easy,\u201d Mr. Chaplin insisted. At the same time, acting such a part can take its toll: \u201cDoing it night after night, you inevitably start feeling battered.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWidely regarded as one of the sharpest script-polishers in Hollywood, Mr. Penhall has had his share of unsatisfying artistic encounters in an industry he likened to \u201ca sausage factory.\u201d He said he\u2019s walked away from several sizable projects uncredited, including the Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Last King of Scotland.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want a credit because I didn\u2019t think it was worth a credit,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s his way of retaining creative control. \u201cIf it stinks, it stinks,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cLife\u2019s too short, and I don\u2019t need the dough.

China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\n\n\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201d\n\nMr. Ma goes on to write:\n\n\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity? Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports. The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness. Any country seeking to increase exports would do better to focus on developing good products and channels to access foreign markets rather than putting up trade barriers.\u201d\n\nRedstone vs. Moonves\n\nShares of CBS are down 1.9 percent and Viacom\u2019s stock is off nearly 1 percent after CNBC reported that Shari Redstone is likely to replace Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, if a deal isn\u2019t reached with Viacom.\n\nShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls CBS and Viacom, is seeking to combine the two media companies.\n\nFrom Reuters:\n\n\u201cHer longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "The savanna became the subject of long-term research in 2000, when Ms. Wessling\u2019s undergraduate adviser at Iowa State University, Jill D. Pruetz, first paid a visit.\n\nSurveying Fongoli, Dr. Pruetz decided it would be a good place to observe the differences between chimpanzee life on a savanna compared to forests. In forests, for example, chimpanzees typically thrive on a diet of ripe fruit. That\u2019s a rare treat on a savanna.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Pruetz could not simply settle down right away and watch the chimpanzees. At first, the sight of her frightened them off. So Dr. Pruetz and her colleagues let the apes grow accustomed to their company. That alone took four years.\n\nAt last, in 2004, Dr. Pruetz and her colleagues could follow the chimpanzees from dawn to dusk. \u201cYou just have to drink water all day,\u201d said Dr. Pruetz, now a professor at Texas State University.\n\nThe team gradually built up a catalog of strange behaviors \u2014 ones rarely if ever seen in others. Forest chimpanzees get enough water from the fruit in their diet so they need less drinking water and can wander in search of food. The Fongoli chimps, by contrast, required daily drinking water and anchored themselves to reliable water sources in the arid landscape.\n\nAnd while forest chimpanzees are active throughout the day, Dr. Pruetz found that the savanna chimpanzees rest for five to seven hours. Dr. Pruetz could often find them lurking in small caves in the dry season, and when the rainy season arrived, the chimpanzees would slip into newly formed ponds and bob there for hours.\n\nForest chimpanzees typically spend all night in nests they build in trees. But at Fongoli, the research team noticed that the chimpanzees often made a late-night racket.\n\nStaying up all night to watch them, Dr. Pruetz discovered that they spent hours after sundown searching for food. \u201cIt might as well have been a daytime scene,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAll these odd behaviors suggested that the chimps were struggling to cope with Fongoli\u2019s harsh conditions. But all Dr. Pruetz\u2019s observations couldn\u2019t reveal what was happening inside their bodies. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how stressed they were,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2014, Ms. Wessling set out to get an answer \u2014 by collecting chimpanzee urine.\n\nLike humans, chimpanzees have molecules in their urine that reflect their physical condition. When they feel stress, for example, they make the hormone cortisol. The pancreas produces a substance called c-peptide in response to food. Its levels can reflect whether chimpanzees are getting enough energy. If a chimpanzee gets dehydrated, the protein creatinine builds up in its urine.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nScientists regularly gather urine from forest chimpanzees, but there, they need only go under a tall tree and hold out a leaf. On the savanna, Ms. Wessling would have to wait until a chimpanzee ambled away from where it had urinated. By the time she reached the spot, the urine might have already seeped into the ground or evaporated. \u201cYou basically watch your sample disappear,\u201d Ms. Wessling said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom 20 chimps, Ms. Wessling gathered 368 urine samples that were taken back to Germany for analysis.\n\nThe chimps\u2019 c-peptide levels showed they ate a decent amount of food, and possibly termites to get additional calories.\n\nWhile that was an indicator of a healthy diet, analyses of the two other compounds told another story. Many of the chimps had produced high levels of cortisol, indicating that life on the savanna could be very stressful. And their creatinine levels were also high, evidence that the heat of the savanna caused them to become dehydrated.\n\nFor all the ways that the Fongoli chimps tried to protect themselves from the heat, it still punished them.\n\n\u201cThese chimps are sort of right at the edge of what they can do,\u201d Dr. Pruetz said. \u201cThis really gives you the biological basis of it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe research was published earlier this month in the Journal of Human Evolution.\n\nTo scientists who study human evolution, the Fongoli chimpanzees offer some intriguing parallels to our ancestors millions of years ago. Studies of DNA indicate that our two evolutionary branches split roughly seven million years ago.\n\nThe earliest members of our branch (known as hominins) may have been chimp-like in some respects, growing fur and walking through forests on their knuckles.\n\nOver millions of years, Africa\u2019s rain forests retreated into patchworks, as savannas expanded. In eastern and southern Arica, hominins moved into open habitats, eventually reaching arid grasslands \u2014 places as daunting for survival as Fongoli.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHow and when hominins got better at coping with heat is a fascinating, unsolved problem,\u201d said Daniel E. Lieberman, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard.\n\nThe results from Fongoli suggest that a chimpanzee-like ancestor might have eked out an existence on an east African savanna. Food might not pose the biggest challenge. Instead, they would be hard-pressed by the heat.\n\nEarly hominins might have used some of the strategies documented in Fongoli, like staying near water and shifting a lot of activity from day to night. But even so, early hominins would have still suffered stress.\n\nThat stress might have only been overcome when hominins evolved new physical adaptations. Humans have skin glands that let us sweat much more than chimpanzees, for example. The origin of our upright posture might also be intertwined with our struggle with heat.\n\nSome researchers have proposed that early hominins began standing to aid in reaching fruit hanging from trees. Peter Wheeler, of Liverpool John Moores University, has suggested that an upright posture would have helped hominins stay cool in an arid environment. On the savanna, walking tall might mean walking cool.\n\nDr. Pruetz suspects Dr. Wheeler may be right, and she hopes to study the Fongoli chimpanzees more to test his idea. The chimpanzees may shift their posture \u2014 as far as they can with an ape anatomy \u2014 in order to cope with the high temperatures. It\u2019s now possible to get close enough to measure the heat flowing from the chimpanzees with a thermal imaging camera.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had that opportunity before,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun stuff we can do.\u201d", "title": "Hints of Human Evolution in Chimpanzees That Endure a Savanna\u2019s Heat", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

Toronto advanced to the conference finals by beating the St. Louis Blues in seven games, but fell short of the Cup finals with a seven-game loss to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\n\n\nBack in 1993, the Leafs relied on grit and experience.

The coach took heat before Game 3 for promoting Plekanec from the fourth line to the second line between Marleau and Marner.\n\nPlekanec had been a disappointment since coming from the Montreal Canadiens in a trade in late February.

It\u2019s almost like you can throw anybody in that situation and they get the job done.\u201d\n\nCallaway, the former pitching coach of the Cleveland Indians, has deftly run the Mets\u2019 bullpen, usually the trickiest bit of strategy for a manager during the game, and he has gotten relief pitchers to buy into the fluid roles of modern baseball.\n\nIn commending Callaway over the weekend, Mets relief pitcher Jeurys Familia, perhaps inadvertently, made comments viewed by some fans as a subtle criticism of Collins. \u201cYou can see the difference,\u201d Familia said of Callaway. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing over there and it\u2019s working.

Two off days and a snowed-out game have allowed Callaway to rely heavily on Familia and relief pitchers, a luxury he will not be afforded during the meat of the season.\n\nSeth Lugo, who was supposed to be the fifth starter to open the season, has been a godsend as a versatile reliever, as has Robert Gsellman, another past starter. They have combined to allow just one run over 12 innings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very proud of roles, the work we put in, and it\u2019s been good to see it translate on the field,\u201d Lugo said.\n\nHealth will likely be the biggest determinant in the success of the Mets this season. The medical staff was overhauled in the winter, and General Manager Sandy Alderson spent nearly $89 million to improve the team by signing players such as the pitcher Jason Vargas and Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the length of our lineup that has really impressed me,\u201d said the outfielder Jay Bruce, who re-signed with the Mets this winter. What Bruce meant is the improved depth and quality of a lineup in which, for example, Brandon Nimmo is not a regular outfielder since Conforto\u2019s return but has the talent to start.\n\nThis week will bring the Mets a long awaited but somewhat ceremonial moment. The Mets need a fifth starter on Wednesday against the Marlins while Vargas recovers from a hand injury, so they will call up Zack Wheeler, who struggled in spring training, from Class AAA Las Vegas for, at least, one start.\n\nTime and injuries have changed some of them, but Wheeler\u2019s return to the major leagues will mean that the Mets\u2019 big five starters \u2014 Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Steven Matz, Syndergaard and Wheeler \u2014 will finally all pitch in the same rotation.\n\nAfter the win Sunday, Harvey said a message had been sent across all of baseball about the Mets.

Across the division, the Phillies improved over the winter, and the Atlanta Braves have hit well to start the season.\n\nFollowing the weekend sweep, Callaway was more realistic about the division landscape and the Nationals than some of his enthusiastic players.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of season left and they have a really good team,\u201d he said.", "title": "Hold On, the Mets Are 8-1?", "authors": ["James Wagner"]}

Yet studios are more reliant than ever on the box office. Squeezed by the rise of subscription streaming services like Netflix, the six major studios reported an 18 percent drop in home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the 2016 period.\n\nDigital TV Research, a British media consultancy, estimated in October that piracy would cost the global movie and television business $37.4 billion in lost revenue this year, an 18 percent increase from 2017. Losses in 2022 were projected to reach $51.6 billion.\n\nTo cope with these challenges and others, Hollywood is consolidating. Disney will soon absorb Fox. AT&T is fighting the Justice Department in court for the right to acquire Time Warner, which owns Warner Bros. As Amazon, Netflix and even Apple pour resources into original content, more consolidation is expected.\n\nPhoto\n\nMergers could lead to budget cuts for the nonprofit Motion Picture Association. Under the current setup, the six member studios chip in more than $16 million apiece annually to fund the association\u2019s global operations, according to tax filings.\n\nThe organization, which endured a 20 percent budget cut in 2009 as the studios dealt with the Great Recession, also faces challenges in Washington. Its influence has diminished over the past decade: Silicon Valley stars reign supreme now.\n\n\u201cI do not think we have punched our weight in terms of influence \u2014 the power that we should have, given the jobs we support,\u201d said Jeff Shell, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features.

Hollywood personalities \u2014 Meryl Streep, Jimmy Kimmel, Kathy Griffin, among others \u2014 have attacked President Trump, who has been happy to return fire.\n\nMany studio executives, while publicly silent, privately worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s position on trade, in particular his aggressive stance toward China, will hurt their profitability. China is fast eclipsing North America as the world\u2019s No. 1 movie market, and studios have been trying to persuade the Chinese government to relax restrictions on film imports.\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative is leading those negotiations, but Mr. Rivkin also plays a role.

But he spoke about solutions with a confidence that felt genuine, calling the association \u201ca dust-covered diamond that can easily shine again.\u201d\n\nHe then began an impassioned recitation of industry data. Did you know, for instance, that more Americans go to the movies than attend professional football, basketball, baseball and hockey games combined? Mr. Rivkin also spoke excitedly about plans, some already in motion, to increase the trade organization\u2019s profile, including improved branding, more star-studded events in Washington and livelier social media feeds.\n\n\u201cReinvigorated at every level,\u201d he said of the association.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Rivkin aggressively disputed the notion that Mr. Trump and Hollywood are on opposite sides.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump probably knows this industry better than any president since Reagan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he understands that entertainment is important both as an economic force \u2014 jobs in every single state \u2014 and as a projection of American values.

Mr. Valenti, who worked in the White House for Lyndon B. Johnson, was larger than life. He picked fights, lionized the studio chiefs and fended off lawmakers\u2019 efforts to limit sex and violence on screen by devising the self-regulating film ratings system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Valenti was followed by an entertainment outsider, Dan Glickman, secretary of agriculture during the Clinton administration. Mr. Glickman, affable but low key, scored victories, including securing $400 million in government production incentives. But Hollywood never accepted him as one of its own. He left in 2010.\n\nMr. Dodd took over the next year. While making inroads on piracy, he also struggled at times to persuade the six studios to speak with one clear voice on crucial industry matters, including the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Michael Lynton, then Sony\u2019s chief, was so furious over the organization\u2019s lack of public support during the early days of that crisis that he almost canceled Sony\u2019s membership.\n\nHerding studio chiefs is harder than it used to be. In Mr. Valenti\u2019s era, the film factories were stand-alone entities whose interests were in lock step. Today, the studios are owned by sprawling conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests.\n\nMr. Rivkin, who has been married to the businesswoman Susan Tolson for 28 years (they have two children), has deep political relationships, some of which involve family. His father, William R. Rivkin, who was close to the Kennedys, served as ambassador to Luxembourg, Senegal and Gambia. His brother, Robert, is Chicago\u2019s deputy mayor. Mr. Rivkin worked at the State Department under John Kerry, a close friend.\n\nAt the same time, unlike his two most recent predecessors, Mr. Rivkin knows Hollywood.

She has been married five times previously and has eight grown children: one in Seattle; the others, including two sets of twins, are in Anchorage. \u201cThey are all being taken care of,\u201d she said. Aware of the judgments that might be made about some of her life choices, she added, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make me a bad person, because I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nMr. Kitcheon (who said he has never used hard drugs; \u201cI just smoke weed and drink beer\u201d) was married once before. His first wife died 25 years ago. After her death, he couldn\u2019t bear to stay in the home where they had raised their 10 children. He put up a tent in the backyard, and much to the confusion of his children, slept outdoors. Mr. Kitcheon said he still owns the five-bedroom Phoenix property where his daughters now live.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not homeless,\u201d said Mr. Kitcheon, a Los Angeles native. \u201cI could leave this city any time. I just don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d He misses his \u201cbabies\u201d but has led a transient life for years. \u201cI tell my kids all the time, \u2018Pops got to go,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I raised them well.\u201d He said he has four sons: two in the Army, one in the Marines, one in the Navy; and six daughters, all nurses.\n\nThe morning of their wedding marked 84 days clean from crack cocaine for Ms. Vestal. It\u2019s the first time that she has tried to stop using the drug. \u201cI would never have done it if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Kitcheon. \u201cIt was really hard, and it\u2019s really hard right now, but knowing that I\u2019m loved and that I\u2019ve got somebody with me, has made it possible.\u201d\n\nMr. Kitcheon said, \u201cI asked her, \u2018Do you want that dope or do you want me?\u2019\u201d He promised that if she was willing to try to quit, he\u2019d help her through it. \u201cI believed in her and she believed in me.\u201d", "title": "Homeless in Seattle, and Marrying Under the Overpass", "authors": ["Candice Pires"]}

Others hand out blobs of scented putty, known as therapy dough, that is designed to calm. Others use meditation and mindfulness to refocus their charges on the hunt for a 4.0 and higher SAT scores.\n\nHomework therapists often have day jobs as clinicians at hospitals, family counseling centers or their own private practices. Evenings they work with overwhelmed students to create study guides, do algebra problems, organize binders, smooth out crumpled papers at the bottom of book bags and do \u201cerror analyses\u201d when a biology test goes awry. But they also help children address the psychological issues that are holding them back, using common counseling techniques like motivational interviewing and exposure therapy, a strategy sometimes used with victims of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAriel Kornblum, a psychologist for children and adolescents, works out of her ground-floor office at the Manhattan Psychology Group\u2019s Upper West Side location. When she is not administering regular therapy, she is often advising middle and high school students whose inability to organize their schoolwork, she says, is hurting their grades, and their self-esteem. Dr. Kornblum helps them develop sorting strategies, workable planners and study schedules while also challenging some of the negative thoughts swimming around in their heads.\n\n\u201cA lot of my clients will say: \u2018I did my homework.

The results include information about learning disabilities, like attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, but also a student\u2019s emotional state.\n\nEllen B. Braaten, the associate director of The Clay Center for Young and Healthy Minds in Boston, says the arrival of this new breed of clinician/coaches is not unique to New York, but is also finding a footing in areas around Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Northern California, where pressure on students to succeed is high and \u201ctherapy isn\u2019t stigmatized.\u201d\n\nThe homework therapists can put up with a lot of drama.\n\nLeah Kesselman, a 28-year-old psychologist who works with Beyond BookSmart, a Boston-based firm with dozens of coaches in the New York area, says she has dealt with students who have repeatedly yelled at her, \u201cGet Out,\u201d or \u201cWe don\u2019t need you.\u201d To calm them down, she sometimes suggests a few minutes of video gaming or the Spotify playlists.\n\nDr. Levy-Warren, the New York psychotherapist, says she worked with a student who once sobbed to her after learning she had received a \u201cB\u201d on a paper. To help, she used \u201creframing,\u201d a popular cognitive behavioral therapy technique, getting at what a \u201cB\u201d symbolized to her and helping her develop a more positive outlook.\n\nMellora Ansbro, a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University, began working with Dr. Levy-Warren when she was a junior at Riverdale Country School, a private school in the Bronx. During meetings that sometimes began at 9 p.m., Dr. Levy-Warren taught her how to write an essay and take better notes, and also how to navigate the high school social scene and manage her parents. Six years later, shortly after graduating from college and anxious about her life, Ms. Ansbro, now 24, hired Dr. Levy-Warren again.\n\n\u201cI was freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a big transition. And I felt underprepared.\u201d\n\nOver the last year and a half, Dr. Levy-Warren has helped her come up with a study plan for the GRE, apply to graduate school and ward off worries about what she should and should not be doing with her life. She has also boosted Ms. Ansbro\u2019s spirits when occasional bouts of worry and depression have set in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Braaten at The Clay Center notes that there are no licensing requirements for homework therapists, so guidelines as to what services they actually provide can be murky and uniform standards are nonexistent. Some build glitter globes with their students to serve as relaxing tools. Others use aromatherapy oils, and encourage students to create flash cards with affirming motivational mantras like \u201cI got this,\u201d or \u201cDone is Better than Perfect.\u201d\n\nFurther, Dr. Braaten says there is no strong evidence that this type of hybrid treatment works.\n\nHolly Schiffrin, a professor of psychological science at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., who researches adolescent development and depression, says she thinks a tutor who helps a struggling student with study skills and confidence makes sense.\n\n\u201cBut there should be a plan in place for them to become fully functioning, independent adults,\u201d she said.", "title": "Homework Therapists\u2019 Job: Help Solve Math Problems, and Emotional Ones", "authors": ["Kyle Spencer"]}

Partly this is because Lesko is a villain to many local champions of public education. I met Ratti as she prepared to go canvassing for Tipirneni; she told me, \u201cLesko has been an advocate of vouchers and privatization and pretty much anything she can do to destroy the public school system.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a deeper link. Both the walkout and the surprising viability of Tipirneni\u2019s campaign are manifestations of the explosive activist energy, particularly among women, set off by the catastrophe of Trump\u2019s election. Since Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, \u201ccollege-educated women have ramped up their political participation en masse,\u201d the historian Lara Putnam and the political scientist Theda Skocpol wrote in a recent article, \u201cMiddle America Reboots Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s this civic renewal that is transforming politics in Arizona.\n\nSpeaking to activists here, I was struck by how similar their stories were to those I\u2019d heard last year while reporting on a special congressional election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District. In both places, women who were once politically disengaged felt demeaned by Trump\u2019s victory. Overcome by a need to do something in response, they\u2019d turned to local politics, which had gradually come to consume their lives.\n\nSave Our Schools, a prominent grass-roots organization supporting the walkout, is an outgrowth of an Arizona group called Stronger Together, which itself is a spinoff of the pro-Hillary Clinton Facebook group Pantsuit Nation. Dawn Penich-Thacker, one of the founders of Save Our Schools, once served as a public affairs officer for the Army, and compared the relationships among the state\u2019s newly minted activists to the bonding she experienced in the military. \u201cIt\u2019s the deepest friendship,\u201d she said.\n\nShe introduced me to Jaclyn Boyes, whom she met when Boyes started a petition demanding that Arizona\u2019s Republican senator Jeff Flake hold a town hall. After Trump\u2019s election, Boyes told me, she had the desolate sense that \u201chalf of my country doesn\u2019t like me because I\u2019m black.\u201d\n\nBoyes attended the 2017 Women\u2019s March in Washington, her first ever demonstration.

While Annie reported on people who had gone looking for naloxone, and contacted pharmacy chains, activists and officials, I kept at it.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to memorize the automated menus at the big chains: \u201cThank you for calling CVS pharmacy. To refill a prescription, press one\u2026\u201d\n\nSometimes a single phone call would last long minutes. I would listen to monotonous hold music while a pharmacy worker searched for the drug or asked several others before returning with an answer. I found myself not putting my phone down between calls to save time.\n\nAs we went down the list, the possibility that had been suggested by that tip turned into a certainty: We found that only about a third of the pharmacies on the list had naloxone on the shelves and would sell it without a prescription, as the city guidelines had set out.\n\n\u201cIs this an emergency?\u201d a pharmacy worker asked. Another apologized for not carrying it, and told me that I\u2019d have better luck finding it by calling 311 or trying a nonprofit. Yet another told me to check the local police precinct.

I have thoughts about it, but I am not contributing to that.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, Capitol Hill is an inherently political place. \u201cThere are Catholics who are Republicans and there are Catholics who are Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is a religious divide; there certainly is a political one.\u201d\n\nThough Father Conroy said he did not know whether politics were behind his departure, he pointed to a prayer he had given on the House floor in November, when Congress was debating tax overhaul legislation.\n\n\u201cMay all members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our great nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to achieve great success, while others continue to struggle,\u201d he prayed. \u201cMay their efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.\u201d\n\nAbout a week later, Father Conroy said, he heard from the speaker\u2019s office. \u201cA staffer came down and said, We are upset with this prayer; you are getting too political,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suggests to me that there are members who have talked to him about being upset with that prayer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShortly after, when he saw Mr. Ryan himself, Father Conroy said that the speaker told him, \u201cPadre, you just got to stay out of politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I have tried to do for seven years,\u201d Father Conroy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound political to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are hospital chaplain, you are going to pray about health,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you are a chaplain of Congress, you are going to pray about what Congress is doing.\u201d\n\nFather Conroy said that was the only time anyone from the speaker\u2019s office had ever chastised him for veering into the political realm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been talked to about being too political in seven years,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The letter asks the speaker for a description of the process that was followed, and for a justification of the decision.\n\n\u201cWe believe that, absent such details, questions will inevitably arise about the politicization of the process for hiring and dismissing a House chaplain,\u201d the letter says. \u201cNot revealing such details could also risk resurrecting prior questions of religious bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cPat is a fairly popular figure in the House,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. \u201cHe\u2019s counseled people and tended to their personal and spiritual needs. This is a personal and jarring decision that affects all of us in a big way.\u201d\n\nBecause of the lack of clarity surrounding his resignation, Father Conroy said that he had been fielding calls from friends and House members, some inaccurately congratulating him on his retirement or worrying that he was sick.\n\n\u201cThey asked me why I am leaving, why I am abandoning them, congratulations on your retirement, what is next,\u201d he said. \u201cTo which I say, \u2018I wasn\u2019t looking for a job.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the most part, that information has been met by shock,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat is the gratifying part.\u201d\n\nFather Conroy said that he had thoroughly enjoyed being the House chaplain, and that he had not politicized his work.\n\n\u201cI have found it myself to be personally liberating because I have not been allowed to engage in the politics of the day, which has been very healthy for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that that was my ministry.\u201d\n\nWhen Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015, Father Conroy gave him a personal blessing in Spanish.

There are large parcels of land available in remote jungle areas.\n\nRiverfront property is most in demand, Mr. Lohr said, adding that prices for some properties close to rivers have jumped 25 percent since 2015.\n\nCayo homes are a bargain compared to Belize\u2019s popular coastal destinations. Prices in the San Ignacio area range from $85 to $125 a square foot, compared to $150 a square foot in the coastal town of Placencia and $180 a square foot on Ambergris, Ms. Rose said.\n\nBuyers in the Cayo district are often \u201clooking for more bang for their buck,\u201d she said.\n\nThe decline in the value of the Canadian dollar hurt the market, making it more expensive for Canadians to buy property in Belize, said Cayo-based John Acott, an agent with Re/Max Belize Property Center. \u201cLast year for me was a little mediocre,\u201d Mr. Acott said. \u201cBut this year is much better.\u201d\n\nBelize should get a boost from recent announcements that international hotel chains Marriott and Four Seasons are planning to open their first hotels in the country, said Brittany McCann, an agent with Belize Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, a real estate company.

But agents said that Cayo is starting to attract more families and younger buyers.\n\nBuyers are increasingly looking for income-producing properties, such as farms and guest lodges, Mr. Lohr said.\n\n\u201cAs recently as two years ago most buyers wanted a place to retire and slow down,\u201d Mr. Lohr said. \u201cNow most buyers are looking for investment opportunities hoping to tap into the growing tourism and rental markets.\u201d\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Belize.

M\u00e1laga-Costa del Sol Airport, in Spain, is about an hour and 15 minutes away; it has many more international flights than Gibraltar International Airport, which mainly accommodates travelers to and from Britain and Morocco, Ms. Armstrong said.\n\nMARKET OVERVIEW\n\nGibraltar\u2019s housing market is \u201crobust,\u201d thanks to a growing economy and very low unemployment, said Mike Nicholls, managing director at the real estate agency Chestertons Gibraltar. In recent years, the territory has become a hub for the online gambling industry and for financial technology services companies, which together account for nearly a quarter of the area\u2019s jobs, according to a 2017 House of Commons briefing paper.\n\n\u201cDespite Brexit, our employment levels are going up every year,\u201d Mr. Nicholls said, referring to Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\n\nAnd Gibraltar, which is just 2.6 square miles, is currently undergoing a building boom, he said, as developers seek to meet pent-up housing demand created by the influx of foreign workers, many of whom favor the modern developments around the marinas of Ocean Village and Queensway Quay.\n\nRecently, Mr. Nicholls said, his sales team sold 105 apartments in just three weeks in a planned high-rise yet to be publicly marketed. Part of a complex called EuroCity, the building will start construction this summer, with prices ranging from around 167,000 pounds, or just under $240,000, for a studio to more than 1 million pounds, or about $1.4 million, for a penthouse.\n\nThe government is also encouraging the redevelopment of the Upper Town neighborhood, a historic and very walkable area that has been neglected, said Jean-Paul Lugaro, owner of Mulberry Real Estate in Gibraltar.

Over the next year or so, he said, around 400 new one- to four-bedroom units will become available, and another 500 to 600 studios and one-bedrooms are in the planning stages, which could overheat the lower end of the market, as speculators and buy-to-rent investors swoop in. Most of the people who are coming to live and work in Gibraltar, Mr. Montegriffo said, are interested in larger units.\n\nWHO BUYS IN GIBRALTAR\n\nAbout three-quarters of foreign buyers are British, Ms. Armstrong said. The rest are primarily European, although she said she has also worked with Israelis and Australians.\n\nWhile demand is driven in large part by imported labor, the strong rental market is also attracting foreign investors, \u201cwho come along and buy 20 apartments,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government\u2019s tax structure tends to attract wealthy individuals, as there is no capital gains or inheritance tax. In addition, individuals with net assets in excess of 2 million pounds, or about $2.9 million, can qualify for a cap on their income tax if they buy a luxury property and meet other conditions, Mr. Lugaro said.\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, said Christina Wright, a lawyer in Gibraltar.\n\nThe typical deposit is 2 percent of the purchase price. Buyers hire a lawyer to handle the transaction, at a fee of roughly 0.5 percent of the price.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStamp duty is charged on properties that sell for more than 200,000 pounds, or about $285,000, at a rate that ranges from 2 percent to 3.5 percent.

He bought Plas-yn-Cwm about 15 years ago, becoming the fourth owner.\n\nWhile many of the original details remain intact, including extensive stained glass and exposed timberwork, the house is not a listed historic structure, though \u201cnothing\u2019s been altered,\u201d Mr. Hoyle said. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve had to update things, they\u2019ve all been put back to how they originally were, because that\u2019s just how I wanted it.\u201d\n\nThe entrance is through a large enclosed porch with a tessellated floor and stained-glass window depicting images from Aesop\u2019s Fables. An arched door leads into an airy reception hall that has a fireplace with a timber mantel, a grand oak staircase and an ornate stained-glass window.

Moral qualms aside, that good friend would likely agree the victim was an intolerable jerk who had it coming and, jeez, you shouldn\u2019t have done this but where do you keep the shovel? Researchers have long known that people choose friends who are much like themselves in a wide array of characteristics: of a similar age, race, religion, socioeconomic status, educational level, political leaning, pulchritude rating, even handgrip strength. The impulse toward homophily, toward bonding with others who are the least other possible, is found among traditional hunter-gatherer groups and advanced capitalist societies alike. New research suggests the roots of friendship extend even deeper than previously suspected. Scientists have found that the brains of close friends respond in remarkably similar ways as they view a series of short videos: the same ebbs and swells of attention and distraction, the same peaking of reward processing here, boredom alerts there. The neural response patterns evoked by the videos \u2014 on subjects as diverse as the dangers of college football, the behavior of water in outer space, and Liam Neeson trying his hand at improv comedy \u2014 proved so congruent among friends, compared to patterns seen among people who were not friends, that the researchers could predict the strength of two people\u2019s social bond based on their brain scans alone.\n\nAnd in \u201cFriendship\u2019s Dark Side: \u2018We Need a Common Enemy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Angier writes:\n\n\u2026 But homophily, researchers said, is also the basis of tribalism, xenophobia and racism, the urge to \u201cotherize\u201d those who differ from you and your beloved friends in one or more ways.

The music includes red howler monkeys, breathy thumps from the mutum jungle fowl, droning cicadas, eerie calls locals attribute to deadly bushmaster vipers and the unhinged excitement of elusive titi monkeys. Around your feet, the beach is crisscrossed by jaguar tracks and those of the pony-size tapir, a shy beast that, if you keep quiet, will saunter out of the forest and swim across the river.\n\nThis is what scientists call an \u201cintact forest landscape.\u201d It\u2019s a swath of at least 500 square kilometers (about 193 square miles, equal to 70,000 soccer fields) of unbroken forest. Because of their size, these areas have maintained all their native plant and animal life and biophysical processes. These forests still adorn parts of our planet\u2019s tropical midsection, notably the Amazon, Congo Basin and the island of New Guinea. And they form a northern belt, the boreal forests of Canada, Russia, Alaska and Scandinavia.\n\nIntact forests today total around 11.8 million square kilometers (about 4.6 million square miles), according to estimates by a group of researchers and organizations, including Greenpeace, Global Forest Watch, World Resources Institute, Transparent World, University of Maryland, World Wildlife Fund of Russia and Wildlife Conservation Society.

{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "California has of course also become the Democratic Party\u2019s most important stronghold. In 2016 Hillary Clinton carried California by well over four million votes \u2014 and ran behind Donald Trump by more than a million in all the other states combined. This distinct political identity naturally feeds the impression, among progressive admirers and conservative critics alike, of California as a realm apart. So do the declarations by Brown and his attorney general, Xavier Becerra, of their commitment to environmental and immigration policies at odds with Trump\u2019s.\n\nPhoto\n\nPositions like these amount to the \u201cState of Resistance\u201d of Pastor\u2019s title, but the book\u2019s argument is actually the opposite of what \u201cresistance\u201d might imply. Instead, Pastor, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, suggests that at just the moment California seems most out of sync with national trends, it is in fact regaining its role as bellwether and pioneer. \u201cThe country needs resistance to be sure,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut it also needs a vision of what America can become.\u201d In his book, which is concise, clear and convincing, he contends that the redemptive arc of modern California\u2019s history offers both cautionary and constructive guidance on a vision for the country as a whole.\n\nPastor sets out his story in three acts \u2014 rise, fall, recovery \u2014 each of which offers surprising insights for readers outside the state (and many inside as well). In describing the post-World War II years of expansion, which took place under governors of both parties, he emphasizes how heavily they involved public spending and investment \u2014 roads, schools, parks, both advanced research universities and numerous community colleges \u2014 and how much they shared a goal of preparing the state for new arrivals and future citizens. \u201cCalifornia in the 1950s and 1960s was precisely the sort of demonstration project for an active government that many conservatives seem to fear at a national level,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe real secret to California\u2019s once and future success was exactly its agreement on a social compact in which the public and private sectors worked to create paths upward for both those who were in the state and those who were to come.\u201d\n\nThe unhappy decline that constituted the second act was, in Pastor\u2019s view, an uncannily precise preview of the economic, social and political discontents that now embitter our national politics. Deindustrialization hit California as hard in the 1980s as it hit any place in the Midwest. (Forty percent of the lost American manufacturing jobs in the early 1990s were in this one state.) Ethnic change was much more rapid. Pastor points out that between 1970 and 1990, the share of California\u2019s population that was foreign-born rose from 9 percent to 22 percent. This was distinctly different from the rest of the country, where the foreign-born share rose in the same period from around 4 percent to just over 6 percent, and it led to what Pastor calls the \u201cracial generation gap.\u201d That is, a politically and economically powerful older generation, mainly white, resisted paying taxes to build schools and parks for a younger generation that was mainly nonwhite.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

From Reagan through Schwarzenegger (with the exception of Jerry Brown), Republicans dominated the governorship of California. Now Republicans hold no statewide office at all. Of California\u2019s 53 congressional seats, only 14 are in Republican hands, a number almost certain to go down after this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThen we have the recent years of recovery, about which many reports (including some I have written) emphasize the savvy of Brown and his team. Pastor stresses instead two structural favors. One was a return to the collaborative public-private ventures, with an emphasis on long-term investment, that marked the state in its highest-growth years. Even today\u2019s center of extreme private wealth, the Bay Area tech industry, illustrates the point, Pastor says. Its leaders recognize that they and the state rise or fall together. Because they \u201coften see themselves in a sort of collective ecosystem that allows for individual success,\u201d within this zone of hyper-capitalism \u201cthere has been a sense, now somewhat eroded by growing internationalization, of business responsibility for stewarding the region.\u201d\n\nThe other factor in the modern rise, he emphasizes, is on-the-ground social movements: by labor unions, by immigrants and immigrant-rights advocates, by students, by Latino or African-American groups, and by others determined to offset corporate power with their organized voting and protest strength. Pastor is an academic sociologist, and this part of his book is written more in sociologese than the rest, including its extensive discussion of \u201cintersectionality,\u201d the overlapping effects of barriers of race, gender, class and other inequalities. But it ends with a list of practical lessons that can be drawn from California\u2019s recent history to the national politics of coming years. One of these involves appreciating the geographical breadth a progressive movement can have. In California terms, this has meant fielding candidates and motivating voters in the conservative inland regions as well as along the coast. The national counterpart would be Democrats contesting races even where they seem to have no chance. Another lesson suggests progressive groups build alliances with business leaders, as in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cAmerica now looks like California at its lowest point,\u201d Pastor says. He offers a guide to a possible path back up.", "title": "How California Turned Into a \u2018State of Resistance\u2019", "authors": ["James Fallows", "Manuel Pastor"]}

Although most people can enjoy gluten-containing foods without issue, unintentionally consuming even small amounts of gluten can pose health risks for individuals with celiac disease.\n\n\u201cCommercial oats are often grown in fields that have previously grown wheat, transported by methods of transport where other grains are transported, and frequently milled in facilities that mill other grains,\u201d said Dr. Peter Green, a professor of medicine who directs the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University.

In addition to oats, other inherently gluten-free grains \u2014 such as millet, sorghum and corn \u2014 also have the potential to come into contact with gluten-containing grains, Dr. Green said.\n\nIn order to carry the gluten-free label, a manufacturer must assert that a product\u2019s gluten level is below the regulated threshold of 20 parts per million, a standard set by the Food and Drug Administration in 2013.

Renderings of the project show wide, verdant sidewalks, with bustling businesses, cafes, shade trees and children running through fountains. The developer estimated that 23,000 people will fill the Water Street area every day, as residents, visitors or workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this for a long time,\u201d said Bob Buckhorn, who has been Tampa\u2019s mayor since 2011. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed our economic DNA. I knew that if we were going to invest in intellectual capital, we had to create a built environment and an urban core that was attractive to young people, which meant completely transforming downtown Tampa on the waterfront.\u201d\n\nThere was much that needed changing. Tampa, incorporated in 1849, was long known for little more than phosphate mining, cigar factories, mobsters and corrupt politicians. It was sometimes derisively referred to as Sin City or Little Chicago.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

But by the late 1950s, he said, the city center had gone into a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mormino recalled walking around the Channelside area just east of downtown in the early 1980s and seeing a \u201cdeserted\u201d landscape that was populated by jack rabbits and home to abandoned shipping wharves and a dilapidated cast-iron drawbridge.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now is on a very different level,\u201d Mr. Mormino said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s on steroids. It\u2019s pretty dramatic.\u201d\n\nCity and county officials hope to attract companies in the high-tech, financial and creative sectors to fill the new space, not only downtown but elsewhere in the area. In the last three years, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, Ashley Furniture and Bertram Yachts have opened offices or other facilities here.\n\n\u201cThis whole area has gone through a transformation,\u201d said Noah Breakstone, a managing partner at BTI Partners, a developer based in Fort Lauderdale. BTI is planning the $400 million Westshore Marina District, a 52-acre waterfront project in Tampa on long-vacant industrial land.\n\n\u201cTampa presented a strong opportunity for us,\u201d Mr. Breakstone said. \u201cIt has a lot of dynamics similar to what Miami had in terms of its ability to grow, but Miami is now out of land. Tampa still has available land on the waterfront \u2014 a really limited commodity in most places.\u201d\n\nPlans for the Westshore Marina District call for hundreds of townhouses and condominiums, as well as restaurants and stores. Its crown jewel, the developer said, will be Marina Pointe, a complex with a 150-slip marina, the largest in Tampa, and three 16-story towers designed by the Miami architect Kobi Karp, each with 110 condominiums.\n\nThree other South Florida developers, the Related Group, Lennar Corporation and the Bainbridge Companies, have purchased parcels from BTI in the Westshore site for their own residential developments. Related, a major Miami-based developer, has several other residential projects in the works in Tampa and St. Petersburg, including the rebuilding of Tampa\u2019s oldest public housing site into a $350 million development with 1,636 mixed-income units and 177,000 square feet of commercial space.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nTo the east of the Westshore Marina District, the New York developer Bromley Companies is planning a mixed-use, 1.8-million-square-foot project called Midtown Tampa at a cost of more than $400 million.

{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "The Trump team was so impressed with Nunes that, according to the transition official, it considered bringing him into the administration. A few weeks after the election, the congressman traveled to Trump Tower, where, according to transition officials, he and Trump discussed the possibility of his becoming the director of national intelligence and overseeing an ambitious reorganization of the intelligence community. But Trump ultimately decided to shelve those plans and appoint as director a less disruptive figure, Dan Coats, a former Indiana senator. Besides, with Pompeo leaving Capitol Hill for Langley, Trump\u2019s circle believed that Nunes would be even more valuable to the administration if he remained in Congress, running the Intelligence Committee.\n\nSome 17 months later, that looks to have been a remarkably prescient decision \u2014 as Trump appears to have been able to influence Nunes to a remarkable degree. So much so that during Trump\u2019s time in the White House, Nunes has transformed the Intelligence Committee into a beachhead from which to rally his fellow Republicans in support of the president against his perceived enemies \u2014 not just the Democratic Party but also the F.B.I., the Department of Justice and the entire intelligence community.\n\nIn March 2017, the committee started an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections in order to produce, as Nunes promised at the time, a \u201cbipartisan\u201d and \u201cdefinitive\u201d report. But since then, Nunes has used the committee only to sow confusion \u2014 confusion that has benefited Trump. Perhaps his most notable disclosure from the investigation occurred in February when, over the objections of committee Democrats as well as the Justice Department and the F.B.I., Nunes released a memorandum alleging a conspiracy against the president. He argued that federal investigators seeking a secret surveillance warrant for Carter Page, a former adviser of Trump\u2019s, had failed to fully inform judges that the information in the application came from a potentially biased source, the infamous dossier compiled on behalf of Democrats by the former British spy Christopher Steele. \u201cPolitical dirt was used by the F.B.I., and they knew it was political dirt, to open a counterintelligence investigation into the [Trump] campaign,\u201d Nunes told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u201cIt seems like the counterintelligence investigation should have been opened up against the Hillary campaign when they got ahold of the dossier.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, in March, Nunes and the committee Republicans abruptly wrapped up the investigation into Russian meddling, having concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that, contrary to the official consensus of the American intelligence community, the Russian government was not even seeking to help elect Trump. The president soon promoted the findings on Twitter: \u201cTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Nunes has begun a parallel investigation of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for supposedly abusing their powers in an effort to hurt Trump. On April 10, Nunes instructed the Justice Department to give Congress the two-page document that started the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation in 2016 and threatened the impeachment of the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if they didn\u2019t comply. \u201cWe\u2019re not messing around here,\u201d Nunes told Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham. Wray and Rosenstein acquiesced. Then on April 13, Nunes, along with two other Republican committee chairmen, demanded that Rosenstein turn over copies of the memos James Comey had drafted, as F.B.I. director, about his conversations with Trump. Rosenstein had previously refused to do so, on the grounds that the memos were part of the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into the 2016 elections, but on April 19, he complied. The move set a dangerous precedent for Congress to interfere with the bureau\u2019s active investigations, especially Mueller\u2019s \u2014 which it will almost certainly continue to do.\n\nIndeed, Nunes has already begun laying the groundwork to discredit Mueller\u2019s work before it is even completed. As he said of the special counsel\u2019s investigation in an interview with Fox News\u2019s Maria Bartiromo last month, \u201cI have no faith in that process.\u201d (It\u2019s rubbing off: A recent NPR/PBS \u201cNewsHour\u201d/Marist poll revealed that a majority of Republicans think the F.B.I. is biased against the president.)\n\nThe White House has certainly appreciated Nunes\u2019s efforts. \u201cOnly Mark Meadows,\u201d the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, \u201chas a stronger relationship with Trump,\u201d the former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon says of Nunes. \u201cNunes\u2019s relationship with Trump is that strong.\u201d And what makes Nunes an especially strong \u2014 and effective \u2014 ally for Trump is that they share a worldview. Both men have long considered themselves outsiders doing battle with a corrupt, rigged system. (Nunes refused multiple interview requests for this article. Provided a list of detailed questions, Jack Langer, a Nunes spokesman, responded: \u201cThe \u2018facts\u2019 sent by The New York Times Magazine to check for this article, filled with laughable fictional stories and some entertaining conspiracy theories, are great examples of why so few people trust The New York Times anymore.\u201d)\n\nWhile many Republicans on Capitol Hill may nurse private reservations about Trump but choose not to voice them or stand in his way out of political calculation and fear, Nunes is a true believer. Years before the Russia investigation, he was extremely skeptical of \u2014 if not paranoid about \u2014 the American military and intelligence establishments in a way that presaged Trump\u2019s denunciations of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Now he and Trump are waging war against these foes, real and imagined, together.\n\nDevin Nunes began his political career, appropriately enough, because he believed he had uncovered a sinister plot. In 1996, he was 22, a graduate of the College of the Sequoias and utterly convinced that his alma mater was secretly planning to close its campus farm.\n\nNunes was born into farming. His grandfather founded Nunes & Sons, a prominent dairy operation in Tulare County. As a child, Nunes milked cows and won a Future Farmers of America junior grand champion title with a Holstein named Gem. But Nunes had another abiding interest besides agriculture. In high school, he belonged not just to the F.F.A. but also to the Young Republicans, and he made something of a name for himself as a local political activist. So a few years later, when the College of the Sequoias announced that it was selling the roughly 160 acres on which its campus farm sat \u2014 the same farm where Nunes and thousands of other agriculture students had tended to sheep and goats and pigs while earning their associate\u2019s degrees \u2014 he found a way to marry his two passions. Although he was still younger than many of the students at the two-year community college, Nunes decided to run for the school\u2019s board of trustees, which is elected by local voters. His opponent was a four-term incumbent in his late 50s. Nunes\u2019s platform was as simple as it was urgent: Save the farm. \u201cDevin stood up and said: \u2018You can\u2019t do this. The farm is a treasure. It\u2019s a gem to have this and to have the ability to teach hands-on information about what\u2019s going on in agriculture,\u201d recalls Amaral, who has known Nunes since high school.\n\nThere was just one problem: The farm didn\u2019t need saving. \u201cWe were selling off the old farm, and we were putting the money in a fund to buy a bigger piece of land to build a new farm,\u201d says John Zumwalt, who was then on the board. \u201cOf course we weren\u2019t going to get rid of it.\u201d (Agriculture has long been one of the college\u2019s largest departments.) But in a community like the Central Valley, Nunes\u2019s theory about a plot to close the farm resonated with voters, and he unseated the incumbent. Despite the fevered nature of his campaign, Nunes proved to be an effective member of the board. He was instrumental in finding the nearly 500-acre parcel that the college ultimately bought to build its new, much bigger farm. \u201cWhen Devin first came on, there was some resentment toward him because we liked the guy he beat,\u201d Zumwalt says. \u201cBut that went away within the first year. He worked really hard to make sure we did it right, and by God, we did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust two years later, Nunes decided to run for Congress, successfully battling the California elections board to let him appear on the ballot even though he would be only 24 on the day of the Republican primary, on the argument that he would be 25 by the general election in November \u2014 finally old enough to serve in the House of Representatives. He wound up losing the primary by 800 votes, only to watch his opponent be defeated by the Democratic incumbent. But in 2002, after the California Legislature created a new, more Republican-friendly Central Valley congressional district, Nunes ran again and won.\n\nIn the House, Nunes quickly fell under the tutelage of John Boehner, who seemed an unlikely choice of mentor at the time. Ever since a failed coup attempt against Newt Gingrich in 1997, Boehner had been wandering the political wilderness; he had little truck with House Republican leaders like Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay. But Boehner offered other certain intangibles that appealed to Nunes \u2014 namely a laid-back persona and a clubhouse-like office where cigarette smoking was permitted, red wine flowed and 5 o\u2019clock could never seem to come soon enough. Nunes entertained Boehner and the group around him with stories about farming and soon developed a reputation as something of a jokester, thanks to his penchant for coming up with cutting nicknames for other House members. (I asked Pat Tiberi, a former congressman from Ohio who frequented Boehner\u2019s office, what some of those nicknames were, but he demurred. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t go there,\u201d he said. \u201cDevin has a very good sense of humor.\u201d)\n\nBy 2006, the congressional Republican leadership had been tarnished by a series of ethics scandals; suddenly, being on a team of outsiders was politically advantageous. Boehner challenged Roy Blunt, a Hastert and DeLay lieutenant, in a race for House majority leader, and Nunes proved himself to be a crucial vote wrangler in the effort. After Boehner returned to the upper echelons of the G.O.P., first as party leader and then in 2010 as speaker of the House, Nunes continued to serve as a valuable wingman, raising lots of money and regularly voting with leadership \u2014 \u201ca loyal, trusted and honest member of the team,\u201d one former Boehner aide says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he was a brawler. \u201cDevin was a member who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to speak out when he saw factions within the conference undermining the leadership or taking advantage of situations in ways that impacted the team,\u201d the Boehner aide recalls. In 2013, when Boehner was unable to dissuade a group of conservative Republican members from shutting down the federal government, Nunes memorably called them \u201clemmings with suicide vests,\u201d elaborating: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings. So they\u2019d have to be more than just a lemming, because jumping to your death is not enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Devin\u2019s all in, he\u2019s all in,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, told me. \u201cAnd when he is on your side, he is on your side. If there was a bar fight going on and Dev walked into the bar and he saw one of his friends, he would immediately get in on the side of his friend. And when it was over and they were walking out, then he\u2019d say, \u2018What was that all about?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBoehner rewarded Nunes\u2019s loyalty in 2010, selecting him as one of just a dozen Republicans to serve on the 20-member House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Nunes seemed to delight in the cloak-and-dagger aura of the assignment. Once, after leaving an embassy dinner in Washington, a fellow congressman remembers Nunes gleefully informing him that the diplomatic attach\u00e9 he found so alluring was, in fact, her country\u2019s top intelligence officer in the United States. In the middle of a run-of-the-mill congressional delegation visit to a foreign capital, Nunes excused himself, explaining that he needed to go receive a briefing from the C.I.A. station chief there.\n\nNunes became a prodigious and daring traveler, designing such lengthy and punishing itineraries that he was often the only congressman on the trips. \u201cHe\u2019d go to God-awful places like Djibouti and Jakarta and not come back for something like two weeks,\u201d one former Intelligence Committee staff member recalls. Nunes\u2019s approach to the job set him apart from his fellow committee members in other ways. When he was appointed to the panel, he was one of several new members, including the Tea Party firebrand Michele Bachmann, whom Boehner had chosen as an apparent olive branch to the House\u2019s most conservative members. Some committee members and staff had been wary that Bachmann, with her fringe politics, would be an uncomfortable fit. But it was Nunes who turned out to be the problem. While Bachmann diligently requested briefings and studied classified materials \u2014 \u201cShe was running for president, so she wanted to learn,\u201d one former committee staff member says \u2014 Nunes gained a reputation as an inattentive student.\n\nIn the Intelligence Committee\u2019s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility \u2014 a secure office in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center where the committee does its work \u2014 there\u2019s a log that keeps track of all the classified materials members request to read. The log\u2019s primary purpose is security, but it also serves as a way of determining which members are doing their homework. According to three people familiar with the log, during Nunes\u2019s first several years on the committee, he rated as its \u201cleast read\u201d member. He had a similarly poor record of visiting the intelligence agencies for briefings. His lack of preparation could be seen in the committee\u2019s classified hearings, where, according to a former committee staff member, Nunes often seemed out of his depth. \u201cThe committee gets to ask direct questions of the C.I.A. director for two hours a quarter, and if a member is using up half his time on questions that he should already know the answers to, it\u2019s not very productive,\u201d the former staff member says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven worse, in the eyes of some of committee members and staff, was how Nunes did get his information. \u201cHe\u2019d go out to these hinterlands and run into security guys there, and they\u2019d give him crazy ideas,\u201d the former committee staff member says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t discerning. These guys might have something interesting that\u2019s one piece of the whole puzzle, but he\u2019d think whatever they had to say was the whole truth.\u201d Then, when Nunes brought back that information to Washington and intelligence officials would try to put it in context for him \u2014 or correct any misinformation \u2014 he would become suspicious. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take people at face value,\u201d a former government official recalls, \u201cand didn\u2019t always believe leadership.\u201d\n\nNunes could go to great lengths in pursuit of his suspicions. In late 2012, he said he heard from \u201cinformants\u201d that Obama administration officials were ignoring evidence in a cache of documents collected from Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, showing that Al Qaeda was much stronger than the administration publicly contended. Nunes took these allegations to the Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, who in turn questioned intelligence officials. Rogers was satisfied with their answers and told Nunes that he believed that the documents, which were being analyzed by Defense Intelligence Agency officials at Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., revealed nothing quite so significant. But Nunes wasn\u2019t convinced.\n\nOn a Saturday in May 2013, he flew from Washington to Tampa and paid a visit to Centcom headquarters himself, where he demanded to meet with the analysts reviewing the documents, in the hope of uncovering evidence of Al Qaeda\u2019s strength \u2014 and an Obama administration cover-up. But after a meeting with the Army major general who headed Centcom\u2019s intelligence wing, Nunes came back to Washington empty-handed.\n\nAt the same time, Nunes was also trying to prove that the Obama administration had covered up key facts about the assault on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Not long after the September 2012 attack, which killed four Americans, including the American ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, the Intelligence Committee began investigating the episode to determine if there had been any intelligence failures. Before going into politics, Rogers, the committee\u2019s chairman, had been an F.B.I. agent \u2014 he was confident he knew how to conduct an investigation. But Nunes apparently did not believe that Rogers was pushing hard enough, and he repeatedly gave Rogers what he thought were tantalizing leads, ones that might prove that the Obama administration could have prevented, or at least mitigated, the Benghazi attack and then tried to cover up its mistake.\n\nNunes had heard that a drone operator at an American air base in Germany said a drone had been flying over the Benghazi compound during the raid and captured video of the incident. According to a source familiar with the investigation, Rogers sent a committee staff member, Michael Ellis, to Germany to find and interview the American drone operator \u2014 who, it turned out, wasn\u2019t even in the drone unit that covered Libya and had been telling tales to his parents, which had somehow made their way to Nunes. Rogers was frustrated that he had spent so long investigating a lead that he believed was absurd on its face. Nunes was not chastened; instead he grew discouraged that Rogers wasn\u2019t pursuing even more leads.\n\nThe conflict between Rogers and Nunes eventually came to a head over the committee\u2019s handling of five C.I.A. contractors who performed a rescue mission in Benghazi on the night of the raid. The contractors claimed that they were told to \u201cstand down\u201d that evening by the C.I.A. officer in charge at Benghazi. They found their way to Nunes in the fall of 2013, and they quickly hit it off with the congressman. \u201cHe was there to hear our story, and the only one I knew of looking for the truth,\u201d Mark Geist, one of the C.I.A. contractors, told me. \u201cThat proved his credibility.\u201d Nunes encouraged Rogers to invite the men to testify before the committee, which the panel did in November 2013.\n\nThe night before their testimony, Geist and two of the other contractors met with Nunes in his congressional office, according to their attorney, Mark Zaid. As they drank port and smoked cigarettes, they received a visit from a surprise guest. Nunes had invited Boehner to join them. For 45 minutes, the speaker was given a preview of what the men would testify about the next day in front of the Intelligence Committee. When Rogers got wind of what happened, he was alarmed. A longtime Boehner ally, he called his friend and, according to a person familiar with the conversation, told him he was potentially tainting the investigation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the end, Rogers and the committee staff did not put much stock in the men\u2019s testimony, finding it muddled and inconsistent. The next November, when the Intelligence Committee released its Benghazi report, it concluded that there had been no \u201cstand down\u201d order. Nunes refused to endorse the report. And Boehner seemed to agree with him, having already created a special committee to investigate Benghazi \u2014 essentially kneecapping Rogers and the Intelligence Committee and paving the way for the further politicization of the panel.\n\nIndeed, Rogers was so bruised by the Benghazi experience that it contributed to his decision to retire from Congress in 2014. Before leaving, he recommended that Representative Mike Conaway of Texas be made the next chairman of the Intelligence Committee, according to people familiar with the matter. But Boehner had someone else in mind to succeed Rogers. In November 2014, he appointed Nunes as chairman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee is one of the most plum assignments on Capitol Hill. Its holder is a member of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2014 party leaders of both houses of Congress and the top Democrat and Republican on the Intelligence Committees \u2014 and is therefore privy to America\u2019s most sensitive national security secrets. As chairman, Nunes now had the power to pursue any number of foreign policy issues \u2014 from defeating ISIS to containing Russia to checking Iran. The item that topped his agenda, however, was hardly a geostrategic imperative: He was, according to multiple sources, obsessed with the Azores, the semiautonomous Portuguese archipelago in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Nunes\u2019s fixation on the Azores would come to dominate his initial years as chairman and serve as an object lesson in his intense distrust of the intelligence apparatus that he oversees.\n\nIn part, Nunes cared about the Azores for personal reasons. His family traces its heritage to the Azores; his wife has roots there as well. Nunes once wrote that because so many Americans of Portuguese descent came from the islands, there was a \u201cunique bond between America and the Azores.\u201d But even those dewy sentiments don\u2019t seem to explain just how fixated Nunes was on the island territory.\n\nFor decades, the most concrete bond between the United States and the Azores was an American military installation on Terceira Island called Lajes Field. During the Cold War, American P-3 planes used Lajes to chase Soviet submarines all over the Atlantic; it also served as a fueling station for cargo planes and fighter jets en route from the United States to military installations in Europe and the Middle East. But the end of the Cold War and technological advances brought an end to Lajes\u2019s strategic importance. The United States no longer needed to worry as much about maritime supremacy in the Atlantic. Cargo planes and fighter jets had sufficient flying ranges that they no longer needed to make as many stops to refuel. Lajes was a natural target for cutbacks, and in 2012, the Air Force announced that it planned to scale back its presence there, ultimately reducing its head count to around 165 from 650.\n\nEven before he was Intelligence Committee chairman, Nunes tried to fight the cuts. He proposed locating an Air Force drone base at Lajes that could be used to target Islamic militants in Northern Africa. He introduced a bill to move the military\u2019s Africa Command from Stuttgart, Germany, back to the continental United States \u2014 with the provision that Lajes be made Africom\u2019s forward operating base. He suggested making Lajes a training facility for F-16 pilots. None of the ideas were deemed practical.\n\nMore controversial, according to two former government officials, Nunes tried to use his junior perch on the Intelligence Committee to install a National Security Agency listening post at Lajes. It was not a natural fit for the agency, largely because Portugal is not part of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, in which Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States share signals intelligence. And although Portugal and the United States are allies, the American intelligence community doesn\u2019t fully trust its Portuguese counterpart. (There\u2019s an old saying among spies: \u201cThere are no friendly intelligence services\u201d; even allies gather information on one another for leverage should they need it.) Nor was the N.S.A. confident that Portugal had the type of counterintelligence controls to protect American secrets. According to these former government officials, Nunes pressed Rogers to insert a provision into legislation that would require the N.S.A. to put a listening post at Lajes. Rogers refused. When Nunes wouldn\u2019t relent, Rogers arranged for Nunes to make his case directly to officials from the C.I.A., the N.S.A. and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They also rejected the idea.\n\nOnce he became chairman, Nunes unveiled a new proposal for Lajes: making it the home of the Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex (JIAC), which included a huge new \u201cintelligence fusion center\u201d for the United States and its NATO allies. But the Pentagon was already planning to build the JIAC at the Croughton Royal Air Force base near London. Not only was Croughton deemed to be the ideal location for the complex, but Lajes was also singularly ill equipped for the job. The base\u2019s housing and facilities would need to be expanded, and perhaps more crucial, the undersea communications cables connecting Terceira to Europe and the United States were not sufficiently robust, meaning new ones would have to be laid.\n\nAlthough Nunes claimed that locating the JIAC at Lajes instead of Croughton would save the Pentagon $35 million a year because of the lower cost of living in the Azores and other efficiencies there, the Pentagon estimated that the infrastructure improvements needed at Lajes would cost $1.3 billion more than those at Croughton. (Nunes would later accuse the Defense Department of inflating its cost estimates and asked its inspector general to investigate; the inspector general\u2019s report showed that the Pentagon\u2019s budget projections were far more accurate than Nunes\u2019s.)\n\nAnd, cost aside, there was still the fact that Lajes is on an island in the middle of the Atlantic, making it inconvenient for many NATO allies. Nunes liked to call the Azores \u201cthe Hawaii of the Atlantic Ocean, only closer to America\u2019s homeland.\u201d But Hawaii, of course, has the advantage of being part of America. And as James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, told Nunes at one Intelligence Committee hearing: \u201cIn Hawaii, there are high schools, and there are medical facilities, and there are PXs and commissaries. And that\u2019s kind of lacking right now in Lajes.\u201d NATO\u2019s military commander at the time, Gen. Philip Breedlove of the Air Force, told National Review that putting the JIAC at Lajes \u201cwould not make financial, strategic or operational sense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNunes persisted. In May 2015, he led a congressional delegation to Lajes. The visit got off to a rough start when the delegation\u2019s plane had to abort its landing attempt at Lajes because of high winds \u2014 a not-uncommon occurrence there \u2014 and divert to a landing field on another island 165 miles away. After finally making it to the base, Nunes and the delegation toured the facilities to assess their suitability for the JIAC. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a fact-gathering visit,\u201d says a government official who was at Lajes during the delegation\u2019s visit. \u201cThey had their opinions, and they were looking to find justification for them.\u201d\n\nThat evening, the Azorean president, Vasco Cordeiro, hosted a dinner in honor of Nunes and his fellow congressmen. A number of senior Portuguese government officials, including the foreign minister, were also in attendance. According to an American official who was at the dinner, Nunes made a toast in which he committed to finding a solution that would not only please the United States but also get the Portuguese everything they wanted. As the evening went on, Nunes\u2019s congressional colleagues made their own toasts echoing his sentiments. \u201cIt was like a fraternity event where everyone was pledging their loyalty to that mission,\u201d the American official recalls.\n\nSeemingly every time American military or intelligence officials would note an obstacle to Lajes\u2019s hosting the JIAC, Nunes would dismiss it as either a red herring or, worse, a manufactured excuse. \u201cHe felt that the reason the Pentagon wasn\u2019t willing to engage on this issue was that the generals didn\u2019t want to give up their lifestyles of being close to London or in Germany,\u201d the government official says. Jim Townsend, who as President Obama\u2019s deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy was the Pentagon\u2019s point person on Lajes, says of Nunes, \u201cHe looked on this almost from a paranoid perspective, like we were out to get him.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Nunes did not get his way: The JIAC is still planned for Croughton, and the American presence at Lajes has been drastically reduced. But Nunes created so much rancor over the issue that some American officials came to question his motives, and even his patriotism. \u201cI was having a hard-enough time being beaten up by the Azoreans and the Portuguese, but it was even harder seeing a congressman being in cahoots with them,\u201d Townsend says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Whose team are you on?\u2019 \u201d A former Pentagon official suspects that during the Lajes negotiations, Nunes was making the Portuguese privy to things they should not have known. \u201cWe would have a conversation about some proprietary matters with Nunes,\u201d this official says, \u201cand then the next day, somehow, Portugal knew some of that.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the episode now, Townsend views it as a harbinger of sorts. \u201cWhen all this stuff happened with the Russians, I laughed like hell,\u201d he says, in reference to the Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation descending into chaos. \u201cOf course it\u2019s Nunes!\u201d\n\nThe moment Nunes was transformed from a powerful but little-known congressman into one of the most polarizing figures in American politics \u2014 praised by Donald Trump as a man who \u201cmay someday be recognized as a Great American Hero,\u201d denounced by Nancy Pelosi as \u201ca stooge for the president\u201d \u2014 occurred on the evening of March 21, 2017. On that night, Nunes was reportedly riding with an aide in an Uber across Washington to an event when he received a call on his cellphone. After hanging up, Nunes abandoned the Uber and the aide and rushed toward the White House.\n\nUntil then, according to Republicans and Democrats, Nunes had handled himself well on the question of Russian influence on the 2016 elections. Together with the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff of California, he had labored to establish an independent investigation. They had drawn up an extensive witness list, pressed intelligence agencies to share highly classified information and, most important, decided to look into areas that might prove politically unpalatable to the Trump administration \u2014 namely the question of whether any Americans had colluded with the Russians. \u201cFor a Congress that was generally not known for legislative accomplishments and bipartisanship,\u201d says Michael Bahar, a former Democratic staff director for the committee, \u201cthe Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Schiff and Nunes, for the first two years, was remarkably functional, productive and bipartisan.\u201d\n\nOn March 20, all those qualities seemed evident when the committee held the first open hearing of its Russia investigation, with James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, as its star witness. \u201cI hope that this committee\u2019s bipartisan investigation,\u201d Nunes said in his opening remarks, \u201cwill result in a definitive report on the Russian actions taken during the election campaign.\u201d Schiff echoed those sentiments in his own opening statement. Then Comey made the hearing\u2019s biggest news \u2014 revealing that the F.B.I. was conducting a counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNunes knew Comey\u2019s announcement was coming, but the hearing seemed to shake him and his fellow Republicans. \u201cRepublican members would tell me some time after that hearing that they considered that hearing to be an unmitigated disaster for them,\u201d Schiff told me. Other Republicans claim it was Schiff himself who was the problem. \u201cI know there were members who wanted Devin to be more out front, because his ranking member, the top Democrat on the committee, was out doing the camera stuff every day,\u201d says Pat Tiberi, the former Republican congressman. \u201cThat kind of forced Devin, ironically, to do something he historically over the last 15 years hasn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nWhatever the motivation, a little over 24 hours after he gaveled the hearing to a close, Nunes arrived for his late-night visit to Pennsylvania Avenue. He headed to the National Security Council offices on the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, right next to the White House. There he reportedly met with Michael Ellis, the man who had once been sent to find Nunes\u2019s fabulist drone pilot in Germany and who was now working for Trump\u2019s N.S.C. Ellis showed Nunes classified documents that had been gathered by another N.S.C. staff member, Ezra Cohen-Watnick.\n\nThe next afternoon, Nunes called a news conference in the Capitol, where he announced that \u201csources\u201d had provided him with evidence that, during the transition, the president or his associates had been swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. When a reporter asked him if he thought that the American intelligence community was \u201cspying on Trump during the transition,\u201d Nunes replied, \u201cI guess it all depends on one\u2019s definition of spying.\u201d He added: \u201cClearly it bothers me enough. I\u2019m not comfortable with it.\u201d Nunes seemed to be lending credence to Trump\u2019s preposterous accusation on Twitter from earlier that month that Obama had his \u201c \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nNunes then headed back to the White House to brief Trump on his findings \u2014 a seemingly unnecessary move considering that the information had been given to him by Trump\u2019s own aides. A few days later, after reporters exposed the ruse (including the fact that the Obama-era eavesdropping had been legal, incidental and inconsequential), Nunes recused himself from the committee\u2019s Russia investigation, although he still refused to cede subpoena power to his replacement, Mike Conaway. In December, after the House Ethics Committee concluded that Nunes hadn\u2019t illegally revealed classified information, he more firmly took the reins of the Russia investigation.\n\nFor House Democrats, Nunes\u2019s \u201cmidnight run,\u201d as they now call it, represented a fundamental break. \u201cDevin and I had a very good relationship until March 21,\u201d Schiff told me. \u201cFrom that point on, I think that he considered it his primary mission to protect the White House no matter the cost.\u201d In the process, Nunes has all but destroyed what was once the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s greatest asset. When the committee was being created in 1977, to exercise legislative oversight of American intelligence agencies, Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill pledged, \u201cThis is a nonpartisan committee; there will be nothing partisan about its deliberations.\u201d Although that goal was occasionally tested, the spirit of nonpartisanship generally prevailed and at times even flourished, as it had under Nunes\u2019s predecessor, Mike Rogers, and his Democratic counterpart, Representative Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Dutch and Mike weren\u2019t stalwarts of their own parties, but they knew they had a national security mission,\u201d says Jamil Jaffer, a Republican lawyer who was a senior counsel on the committee. \u201cThey got together and said, \u2018Look, this stuff is too important to screw up.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut since Nunes\u2019s midnight run, the committee has been crippled by partisan fighting. When the committee met in late March to discuss releasing the Republicans\u2019 incomplete report on Russia, not one Democrat on the committee voted to do so. Representative Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, openly mocked his Republican colleagues, clucking at them like a chicken. Now that the committee\u2019s Russia investigation is essentially over \u2014 Schiff and his fellow Democrats have pledged to keep investigating on their own, but they won\u2019t get far without subpoena power \u2014 the ill will isn\u2019t likely to dissipate. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it can recover, given the degree of bad blood that\u2019s developed between the members,\u201d Representative Tom Cole says. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat and member of the committee, told me: \u201cIt is irreparable as long as Devin Nunes is the chairman. He is Trump\u2019s Michael Cohen in Congress. He is Trump\u2019s fixer.\u201d Beyond that, Nunes has damaged the relationship between the committee and the intelligence agencies themselves. \u201cA lot of your effectiveness in overseeing the intelligence community is based on them wanting to have a good relationship with the overseers,\u201d says a former Intelligence Committee staff member. \u201cThat\u2019s all blown up. They\u2019re not going to do anything they don\u2019t absolutely have to do. They\u2019re going to marginalize the community.\u201d The former staff member adds: \u201cIt\u2019s totally toxic. It\u2019s irreversible. I think the committee has been essentially rendered useless.\u201d\n\nFrom the ashes of his own committee, though, Nunes has emerged in a far more powerful position. His congressional district is so sufficiently red that despite his Democratic challenger\u2019s multiple appearances on MSNBC, his seat should be safe this November, even in what\u2019s shaping up to be a strong Democratic year. In fact, his stature in the area has been enhanced by the Russia controversy. Jim Brulte, the chairman of the California G.O.P., told me: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican officeholder in California, and Nancy Pelosi attacks you, I think most Republican voters turn around and go, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never heard of this guy, but if Pelosi is against him, I\u2019m for him.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore important, the Russia brouhaha has elevated Nunes far beyond the Central Valley. Once considered the scourge of the Tea Party, he is now viewed as a rock star by the activist Republican base across the country. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House G.O.P., uses him in its fund-raising emails. And among his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill, he has never been more popular \u2014 so much so that more than one prominent Republican with whom I spoke predicted that Nunes is on track to one day become the top Republican on the all-powerful Ways and Means Committee.\n\nIn February, at its annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, the American Conservative Union presented Nunes with its Defender of Freedom Award for \u201cconcerted courage, standing up for truth and freedom under intense duress.\u201d When Nunes accepted the award, he was greeted with cries of \u201cWe love you, Devin!\u201d His familiar grimace gave way to a broad smile.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Matt Schlapp, the A.C.U. leader, told Nunes as they appeared onstage together. \u201cI think they like you.\u201d", "title": "How Devin Nunes Turned the House Intelligence Committee Inside Out", "authors": ["Jason Zengerle"]}

The resulting time we have to actually gauge the pitch is almost twice as fast as an eye blink. It is slightly slower than the duration of one rotation of a helicopter rotor blade. But in the time it takes to read this word, the ball will have sailed past. It should not seem a wonder, then, that it has been more than 75 years since an M.L.B. player batted .400.

In \u201cThe Tenth Good Thing About Barney,\u201d by Judith Viorst and Erik Blegvad, a child\u2019s mother suggests they come up with 10 good things to say about their dead cat, Barney, but the child can only think of nine. Like all of Viorst\u2019s books, it is direct and honest and funny, and sweetly consoling in the end. \u201cThe Purple Balloon,\u201d by Chris Raschka, written with enormous sensitivity in conjunction with Children\u2019s Hospice International, helps families and children confronting their own mortality. In \u201cThe Heart and the Bottle,\u201d by Oliver Jeffers, a girl suffering the loss of her father locks her heart \u2014 and her grief \u2014 in a bottle, only to realize she has also locked up the possibility of curiosity and joy. \u201cThe Goodbye Book,\u201d by Todd Parr, is for the very young and uses deceptively simple images of a bereft goldfish to show us all the things we might feel when we lose someone we love. \u201cDeath Is Stupid,\u201d by Anastasia Higginbotham, is for slightly older children and reminds us all that everyone\u2019s experience of death and pain is personal. It\u2019s not less than others, it\u2019s not more. It\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s also O.K. to say \u201cstupid\u201d when you\u2019re talking about death.\n\nAnd now three new books tackle the subject, in very different ways.

The main character, Margot, is sad because \u201cTim is gone.\u201d Salerno rapidly introduces a cast of characters who help Margot give her dead pet turtle, the titular Tim, a send-off. It is a mystery what\u2019s happening for most of the book as the children come and go, one of them floating in on a trio of balloons, until the rock, which has been static on each page, is revealed to be poor Tim. The balloons come into service again to lift the turtle, now in a cardboard box, up to the heavens where he possibly becomes a constellation. This gentle story might be just the introduction some readers seek, but for me, the slow reveal that Tim is a dead pet was so light-handed, it left me feeling detached.\n\nPhoto\n\nA STONE FOR SASCHA (Candlewick, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), written and illustrated by Aaron Becker (the \u201cJourney\u201d trilogy), is the wordless story of a girl trying to process the death of her dog. Initially, at least. Lushly illustrated in digital pastels, it soon expands to take on time and history and cosmology and the interconnectedness of things. On vacation at the beach with her family, seeing another child with a dog, the girl hurls a stone into the sea. On the next page, a golden meteor plummets toward Earth, is lodged deep underground during the Paleozoic era, erupts in a dinosaur-scattering earthquake, and then across various ancient civilizations is alternately worshiped, sculpted, erected, celebrated, crushed, sold, neglected, discovered, plundered and lost to the bottom of the sea. Where, washed by time to a smooth golden stone, it is found by our girl on the beach, who takes it home to place on the dog\u2019s grave. Everyone\u2019s experience of death is personal and the same might be said of books. Some children might consider the leaps in this book too great, others will return to ponder the cinematic images and puzzle out the connections.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatt James\u2019s THE FUNERAL (Groundwood, 40 pp., $18.95; ages 4 to 8) is an oddly exhilarating story of Norma\u2019s first experience of a funeral. In fact, she approaches it more as a \u201cfun-eral,\u201d as the book\u2019s cover makes clear with the bright acrylic and collaged blossom-laden tree, the exuberant children and the separation of \u201cfun\u201d from \u201ceral\u201d in the title typography. Like Viorst, James (\u201cWhen the Moon Comes\u201d) has an ear at child level and beautifully and convincingly shows us children who fidget during the service and consider a mourner\u2019s hairy ear perhaps more than they think about the deceased. But they are not completely irreverent, just children, who are full of life.\n\nFor most books about death are also about life, and we are lucky to have them to help us through both.", "title": "How Do You Talk to Children About Death?

After all, ours is an age when the president is more concerned with building walls than feeding and educating poor kids, Congress is polarized to the point of paralysis and just about everyone else is seemingly focused on getting theirs first. We\u2019ve become a nation of hard cases, armed to the teeth, with fury battling cynicism for primacy as the default emotion. In this world, a book with a cover featuring one bonsai tree leaning lovingly toward another does not appear likely to find much of a place. And yet here is Beam passionately asserting that \u201cthe pendulum is swinging back toward feeling, back toward love and the communal. Back toward empathy.\u201d\n\nWe can only hope. \u201cI Feel You\u201d is less a prescriptive self-help book than a thoughtful exploration of empathy in all its forms \u2014 physiological, historical, sociological and even personal, as Beam struggles to transcend her own less than empathic episodes and explores her aversion to opening herself to change. \u201cSelf-empathy was code for selfish,\u201d she explains before signing up for a workshop on just that. \u201cOne more link in a long chain of American entitlement.\u201d This is a radical book because it challenges the conventional wisdom that self-defense and punitive systems are the only way to keep ourselves physically and emotionally safe, and, maybe more important, because it asserts that it\u2019s possible to work for the betterment of society without the accompanying side effect of feeling like a chump.\n\n\u201cI Feel You\u201d is best thought of as a travelogue, with Beam an amiable and skeptical tour guide to places where a new understanding of empathy has led to new, successful applications. It\u2019s probably fortunate that she is a believer, but not an easy sell. Beam has done a lot of homework on her subject, and early on provides a lively distinction between genuine attempts at social change and what she calls \u201cempathic design,\u201d corporate attempts to make us feel loved or needy or connected \u2014 with the goal that we buy more. As a Harvard Business Review story explains, \u201cEnlightened companies are increasingly aware that delivering empathy for their customers, employees and the public is a powerful tool for improving products.\u201d Those adorable Facebook emojis are a case in point. Early in the book Beam tackles that default American compulsion to monetize even our deepest emotions, quoting, for instance, the headline of a Forbes article that offers that the best reason to teach empathy is \u201cTo Improve Education (and Test Scores).\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut this isn\u2019t where Beam puts her emphasis, even though this section is as entertaining as it is damning of American capitalism. She\u2019s looking instead for deeper cuts \u2014 to understand first whether empathy is inborn or a skill to be learned, and then, either way, to investigate how it can be applied to some of our most intractable problems. She takes the obligatory trip through the history of how empathy has been studied in the past and journeys to the neuroscience lab to see what discoveries are being made about how humans feel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of the solutions she presents for deploying empathy in social situations may be familiar to those working in the fields of education and law. Restorative justice, for instance, \u201ctries to weave a web of understanding and repair. It\u2019s messier than the decontextualized, one-two punch of crime and consequence. It\u2019s a humanized, empathic approach to what is, by design, the passionless metrics of the law.\u201d In practice, this means the student and teacher, or the playground bully and his or her victim, have an opportunity to talk about how they feel, a practice that would probably make the likes of Sean Hannity apoplectic. Special courts for prostitutes and veterans, where their behavior would be placed in context and they would be provided with housing and medical care, would also anger many. To the Fox News crowd, this might be called coddling. But studies of such diversionary programs are showing them to be more effective at preventing and reducing crime than the usual expulsions and prison sentences. And anyway, why not try? Few can claim that our conventional institutions are doing a great job. As Beam suggests, \u201cat a time when the police, the whip-tail of our justice system, are finally being called out for their entrenched and learned brutality, this is the moment for overhaul.\u201d", "title": "How Does Empathy Work?

DEMOCRACY\n\nWhy Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It\n\nBy Yascha Mounk\n\n393 pp. Harvard University. $29.95.\n\nImage\n\nFor decades, it was assumed that democracy, with its free and fair elections, and liberalism, with its broad protections for civil liberties and individual rights, went hand in hand. But today \u201cwe are seeing the rise of illiberal democracy, or democracy without rights, and undemocratic liberalism, or rights without democracy,\u201d Mounk writes. This has pitted far-right parties in Europe, which now appeal to a sizable chunk of the electorate while demonizing immigrants and minorities, against technocratic institutions like the European Union, which impinge on individual liberty in the name of collective solutions.\n\nMounk\u2019s material is densely packed and he has a tendency to repeat himself, but his book provides important insights into the present political moment. He cites three reasons for the weakening of liberal democracy: the rise of social media, which is \u201cempowering once-marginal movements and politicians\u201d in ways good but often bad; an increase in economic inequality, which he calls \u201caffluence without growth\u201d; and a nativist backlash against an upsurge of immigration and ethnic diversity, which politicians like Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary have exploited.\n\n\u201cTo save democracy,\u201d Mounk writes, \u201cwe need \u2026 to unite citizens around a common conception of their nation; to give them real hope for their economic future; and to make them more resistant to the lies and the hate they encounter on social media each and every day.\u201d As his book shows, that\u2019s easier said than done.", "title": "How Endangered Is American Democracy?", "authors": []}

Mr. Erdogan is seizing the moment to take credit for the strong economic performance before the economy shows signs of overheating. And there are worries stirred by a credit boom: The annual inflation rate peaked at 13 percent in November, the highest in 14 years. The current account deficit swelled to 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product in December, and the lira tumbled to a historic low in April.\n\nMr. Erdogan is enjoying popular support because of a surge of Turkish nationalism after his victory in the Afrin area of northern Syria, which the Turkish Army and its affiliates took from the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG. The YPG is linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), the terrorist group that Turkey has been fighting for decades.\n\nBut there are concerns about the elections being held while the state of emergency, imposed in the aftermath of the failed 2016 coup, remains in place.

Such ideas can naturally proliferate on social media algorithms, by indulging anger against vulnerable targets and us-versus-them tribalism.\n\nOnce those ideas had popped to the top of the user-driven algorithm a few times, they quickly became perceived as mainstream and were adopted \u2014 and even angrily defended \u2014 by much of the site, which is one of the most widely used on the internet. Many users pushed that extremism into the real world, harassing their targets on and offline.\n\nReddit was able expel those ideas, a study found, only when it went much further than banning a handful of extremists. Instead, it began heavily regulating online discussion \u2014 imposing a degree of social control far beyond what other platforms like Facebook and Twitter have done.\n\nAnyone who regularly uses Twitter will recognize the way that it inadvertently trains users \u2014 by providing bursts of affirmation when a post goes viral \u2014 to win plaudits from fellow travelers by putting down users on the other side of any argument and, if no such argument exists, to start one. It is akin to Facebook\u2019s inadvertent promotion of anger and tribalism with a less active algorithm but on a far larger scale.\n\nOnline outrage can sometimes be a necessary way to channel popular opposition to, say, the injustices of systemic racism or other forms of discrimination. It\u2019s not always bad.\n\nThe problem arises when negative, tribal emotions begin to permeate social media, which increasingly dominates users\u2019 lives and therefore shapes their perceptions of the world offline. Like in Sri Lanka, that can have real-world consequences, albeit more subtle ones, by deepening the social and political polarization that is one of American democracy\u2019s toughest problems at the moment.\n\nAnd by contributing to the sense that every issue is just a way to keep score in a zero-sum game between political tribes, that dynamic can make serious problems more difficult to solve.", "title": "How Everyday Social Media Users Become Real-World Extremists", "authors": []}

The Marlins drafted him in 2007 as a 17-year-old, eventually awarded him a $325 million contract and watched him develop into a National League most valuable player before trading him to the Yankees in December.\n\n\u201cThank you for not naming me that, especially being drafted by Miami,\u201d said Stanton, who will make his home debut for the Yankees on Monday afternoon. \u201cThat would have been not so good.\u201d\n\nWe are all born into names, and, like circumstance, some are more fortunate than others, particularly for athletes. Amid the dysfunction of the Knicks, Carmelo Anthony\u2019s countenance remained Melo. Why wouldn\u2019t Noah Syndergaard, towering with flowing blond hair, embrace his distant heritage and answer to the name fans gave him, Thor? And there would not be an admonition for all to rise for Aaron Judge if his adoptive parents had been named Jones.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile some athletes are destined to embody their names, Stanton\u2019s name \u2014 polyglot, lyrical and lengthy \u2014 may reveal something about him, too.\n\nIf he had stayed with Mike \u2014 the name he used publicly through high school and during his first two seasons with the Marlins \u2014 he would not even be the first Mike Stanton to play for the Yankees. But there has never been another Giancarlo to play in the major leagues.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got something unique, you don\u2019t run from it, you embrace it,\u201d said Stanton, whose bats and gloves have always been stamped with \u201cGiancarlo.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve met some cool fans that come up and say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got the same name.\u2019 But, personally, there\u2019s no one in my phone that I say, \u2018Oh, what up, Giancarlo?\u2019 I like the uniqueness of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is not to say he minds what people call him. His mother calls him Cruz, his father calls him Mike, relatives call him Mikey and his new teammates mostly call him G. His parents gave him so many names, they said, in part so he could choose the one he liked.\n\nMeet the Family\n\nWhen Giancarlo was learning how to write, he made a drawing for his father. He spelled out his first name, all in lowercase, with brightly colored markers. His father took it to work at the post office and hung it in his locker.\n\nIf it was hard then to see his son growing up to be one of baseball\u2019s best players, it was easier in that drawing to see an expression of what he might become \u2014 his attention to detail, his zest for rich experiences and an embrace of his name.\n\nIn that way, along with his uncommon size, 6 feet 6 inches and 245 pounds, Stanton seems to be neatly tailored for New York and all that it has to offer. Until now, his exposure to the city\u2019s culture, clubs and cuisine has come in small bites: a night out here, a weekend there. Home runs, like the two he hit on opening day on Thursday in Toronto, will make it easier for the fans to embrace him. But they will also make it harder for him to blend into the background.\n\nStanton was raised in the melting pot Tujunga area of Los Angeles by a mother and father who were poles apart. His parents were married for 10 years \u2014 splitting up when he was 8 \u2014 and seem to have but one thing in common: They both worked for the Postal Service.\n\nMike has the wit and fashion sense of a suburban dad \u2014 khaki shorts with the shirt tucked in, white socks, a sweatband on his wrist \u2014 and is as deeply abiding as one. He was there for his son growing up \u2014 throwing him batting practice after school before putting in a night shift \u2014 and in his moment of peril, accompanying him to a hospital when he was horrifically hit in the face by a pitch in 2014.\n\nJacinta Garay, whose parents were African-American and Puerto Rican, has piercings on each cheek and musical tastes ranging from Afro-Latin jazz to Lynyrd Skynyrd. She recently got her first cellphone so Giancarlo no longer had to leave a message on the house phone to reach her. But she still rates as a cool enough mom that Stanton invited her to his birthday party at a Hollywood club so she could meet Snoop Dogg.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf her son\u2019s predilection for haute couture (and flashy sneakers, including a pair of gold metallic high tops), his mother said: \u201cHe\u2019s really into coordination and how things look and how to match the colors.

Her older son, Egidio Carlos Moacir Garay, has a first name she found poetic with the Portuguese soft \u201cg\u201d (pronounced e-JID-e-o) \u2014 but off-putting with a hard Spanish \u201cg.\u201d Moacir is a nod to the Brazilian jazz composer Moacir Santos.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An aficionado of foreign and independent films, Garay revered the actors Giancarlo Giannini and Giancarlo Esposito, and she liked the way the name sounded. \u201cI talked to my cousin and she was, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do it,\u2019 because we just loved the way that Giancarlo flows,\u201d Garay said, pronouncing it with a flourish.\n\n(Stanton\u2019s second name came because his mother\u2019s favorite singer was Celia Cruz and because an actor who lived in the neighborhood \u2014 A Martinez \u2014 played a character named Cruz on the late-1980s soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d)\n\nIf their names caused occasional angst, the children did not stew over it. Egidio went by E. G., Kyrice went by Ky and Giancarlo became Mike.\n\n\u201cWe just chalked it up to, my mom went to too many Parliament concerts in the \u201970s,\u201d said Egidio, 38, who teaches political science at Glendale Community College in California. \u201cIt just kind of was. It wasn\u2019t something we spent a lot of time deconstructing.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, though, their names may have subtly spurred his worldview.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in more suburban areas where you have that name that stands out, it\u2019s already pointing you out as being a little different,\u201d Egidio said. \u201cBeing a little kid in first grade being picked on for your ethnicity and identity, it compels you to make those broader connections to cultures and have a wider horizon about the world.\u201d\n\nFor Giancarlo, there were other nudges to do that. His father had traveled to China, India and Africa. His uncle Miguele would bring him gifts and regale him with tales about his frequent visits to Colombia, and take him to local Latin festivals. Giancarlo\u2019s eyes were opened further when he took a trip with high school classmates to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, at the tip of Baja California Sur. He went fishing, rode all-terrain vehicles on the beach, ate Mexican food and listened to mariachi.\n\n\u201cIt was fascinating to me,\u201d said Stanton, who in recent off-seasons began to explore Europe, and then places further afield, cities like Istanbul, Bucharest, Jerusalem and Dubai. Asia and South America are being considered as the next possible destinations. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand until you grow up a little bit how cool places are.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe more recent trips have been with two housemates \u2014 the former Marlins pitchers A.

I don\u2019t want to spend all my energy being mad and focused.\u201d\n\nWhile Stanton\u2019s Yankees teammates have been struck by how fastidiously he adheres to his hitting and workout routines, he is adamant about leaving his work at the office. He has told his father, at times, that he does not want to talk about baseball with him. And Ramos, who has lived with him since 2011, said that in the time they have known each other, they have not had more than 10 conversations about baseball away from the ballpark.\n\nThe travels over the winter also provide a necessary break from baseball.\n\n\u201cWe play seven months, counting spring training, and you\u2019re so regimented that if you don\u2019t get away it makes you crazy,\u201d said Ramos, the Mets reliever who will share an apartment with Stanton in New York this season. \u201cWe actually set a plan for what we want to do, and 100 percent of that time we don\u2019t even stick to that plan. There\u2019s no one holding us to it but us. That\u2019s the balance.\u201d\n\nWhile Ramos has relished experiences like riding to a pyramid in Egypt on camelback \u2014 \u201cIt looks fake, like it\u2019s in a movie,\u201d he said \u2014 their group also returned home with conversations that challenged the way they think. \u201cYou go there and you see what\u2019s true and not true,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Stanton, his first trip to Europe was a transformational one. Though it was regimented \u2014 he did baseball clinics in the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Italy after the 2011 season \u2014 the architecture, the food and the culture were unlike anything he had seen growing up in Los Angeles, bouncing through minor league towns or living in Miami.\n\nHe also noticed how it sounded to hear names like Gianpiero, Gianpaolo, Gianluigi and even Giancarlo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen he returned to Los Angeles, he matter-of-factly mentioned to his parents that the next season he was no longer going to go by Mike.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI had my mouth open for a week. He\u2019s going to go by Giancarlo now?

Over and over again, Karp is seen swaddling, handling and shushing babies into submission while talking to the camera in a voice so hypnotic it could be trademarked. One exhausted-looking father praised Karp for turning his crying daughter \u201cto Jell-O.\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly revolutionary, but his method was built on fast, practical tips that, well, worked. So we clung to them, feeling a little sheepish to be following a parenting expert so literally.\n\nBirndorf told Karp that a pediatrician had recently visited the center and suggested that babies not be put to sleep on nursing pillows or on bouncing chairs \u2014 a reversal of previous pediatric guidelines. The advice of parenting experts \u2014 many but not all of whom are doctors \u2014 kept changing, she complained. The contradictions she recounted, from conveying to women that motherhood is a natural state to instructing them on exactly how and where their babies should sleep, all while nullifying earlier recommendations, seemed to get at an inherent paradox at the heart of a profession whose stated goal is to empower parents. \u201cHighlights from 100 years of expert solicitude confirm the dirty little secret of child rearing: Though parenting gurus preach the supreme importance of consistency, their own shifting wisdom is proof of its impossibility,\u201d Ann Hulbert, the author of \u201cRaising America\u201d (2003), a sweeping history of child-rearing advice, wrote in this magazine.\n\nPhoto\n\nKarp nodded at Birndorf sympathetically. That he is one of those gurus, peddling parenting products, didn\u2019t seem to discomfit him. Whenever someone points out the hypocrisies of today\u2019s parenting industry, which happens often enough, Karp doesn\u2019t try to defend it, or himself. He commiserates, and it sounds genuine \u2014 the ambivalent doctor trying to help parents make sense of a chaotic world. That\u2019s one reason many parents find his approach so reassuring. Unlike other parenting books, Karp\u2019s doesn\u2019t feel preachy or berating. His tips can be applied just as easily by fathers as by mothers, and his pragmatic advice and suggested baby schedules don\u2019t feel like more than what they are: suggestions. But as I trailed him on his rounds, his suggestions invariably seemed to crescendo toward a pitch.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he told Birndorf, \u201cthis is where they would use a SNOO.\u201d\n\nWhen explaining his philosophy of parenthood, Karp likes to quote his late mother: \u201cKeep an open mind, but don\u2019t let your brain fall out.\u201d Karp grew up in Queens with two older sisters in a family he describes as Jewish but not Orthodox, Democratic but not political. His father was a building engineer and occasionally a door-to-door salesman; his mother was in charge of the business\u2019s bookkeeping. As a child, Harvey was temperamental. At 12, he smashed a golf club into a painting his sister made. Later, he took up meditation. \u201cIt was right when the Beatles were doing it,\u201d he said. This began for him a lifelong interest in Eastern and alternative practices even as he decided to enroll in medical school.\n\nBy his second year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, Karp knew that he wanted to care for children, whom he considered more \u201coptimistic and resilient\u201d than adults. He moved to Los Angeles for a residency at Children\u2019s Hospital, meeting and marrying a woman who was studying to become a family counselor. At night, he pored over his wife\u2019s textbooks about family dynamics. He trained under Barbara Korsch, a pediatrician who was among the first to study the field of doctor-patient communication and to call for \u201creducing the power gap\u201d between physicians and parents. \u201cBeing smart is important, but you can\u2019t get through the door by being an arrogant, smart doctor, unless you want to be a surgeon or a radiologist or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re dealing with patients, you\u2019re knocking at the door and you\u2019re being invited in. You have to be a good guest.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, he began working at U.C.L.A. hospital\u2019s child-abuse team. He watched as babies were wheeled into the hospital in the middle of the night because their parents didn\u2019t know how to soothe them or had badly shaken them when they screamed uncontrollably. \u201cIt was perplexing to me, because I thought: We could put a man on the moon. We could cure some types of cancer. We could make long-distance phone calls around the world. But we don\u2019t know why babies cry, and we don\u2019t know how to help them sleep.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis issue of infant colic \u2014 of otherwise healthy babies who cry for more than three hours a day, at least three days a week, in the first three months of life \u2014 gnawed at him, and he immersed himself in books on evolution and anthropology. He learned about a Pygmy tribe that passes around babies between different community members all day long so that children develop multiple relationships early. He read the fieldwork of the anthropologist Melvin Konner about the infants of the !Kung San people in the Kalahari, who are carried in slings and rarely cry for more than a minute at a time. In the West, about 15 to 20 percent of babies have colic. \u201cSo either the !Kung babies were mutant babies \u2014 different from others \u2014 or those parents knew something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne day, when he was 29, Karp felt a dull pain in his neck as he was heading back to the hospital from lunch. He asked an intern to perform an EKG on him, but the intern didn\u2019t know how to read the results. \u201cSo I\u2019m showing him, \u2018Here \u2014 oh, my God, this is cardiac ischemia.\u2019 \u201d What he was reading was his own heart attack. He was kept in the hospital for a week for observation and advised to eat half a pound of salmon a day to reduce his cholesterol. The incident was mild enough that it didn\u2019t have lasting effects, but it left him with a greater sense of urgency. \u201cIt was a crystalline moment,\u201d he told me, of coming to terms with his own limitations. From then on, whenever he went for a run in Santa Monica and reached an area with outdoor stairs, he forced himself to think, as he descended, that at the very bottom \u201cis the end of my life and to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nBefore the heart attack, he had planned on going into child-development research, but now he thought the demands of academia would be too taxing. Instead, he joined a practice in Los Angeles with two other pediatricians and began to develop a local following. He threw himself into the job. Early in his career, he resolved never to do a checkup for less than half an hour. On some days, he visited six different hospitals to meet his newborn patients. As his work got more demanding, Karp and his wife grew apart and divorced.\n\nKarp was beginning to develop his concept of the \u201cmissing fourth trimester.\u201d Human babies are born about three months prematurely, the theory goes, because their heads, which grow rapidly, need to be able to fit through the birth canal. Some scientists dispute Karp\u2019s notion that human gestation is too short. \u201cSadly, the evidence doesn\u2019t support that,\u201d Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, told me. But Karp insists that this explains why during the first months of life, babies can be lulled back into a womblike \u201ctrance\u201d through the use of certain cues that Karp calls the 5 S\u2019s: a combination of swaddling, shushing, placing the baby on her side or stomach, swinging her and letting her suck. He noticed that for each baby the \u201csymphony of sensations\u201d was slightly different \u2014 some babies needed extra movement, others a light jiggle \u2014 though all the infants responded well to swaddling, even if they seemed resistant at first.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy the early 1990s, Karp was running his own clinic, with a playground out back, and eventually he hired four pediatricians to work with him. \u201cAt the time, if you could get in to see Dr. Karp, then you\u2019ve got it made,\u201d Elaine Hall, whose son became a patient of Karp\u2019s in 1996, told me. \u201cHe had a kind of hippie vibe to him then. He was gentle and comforting, and he had a long ponytail.\u201d Karp gave her son a diagnosis of severe autism when he was 2. \u201cDr. Karp took me aside, and I\u2019ll never forget \u2014 I get teary \u2014 he said: \u2018You\u2019re going to go on a journey. It\u2019s a different path than you envisioned, but I can promise you you\u2019re going to have lots of experiences that are going to make your life richer than you even imagined.\u201d\n\nKarp became famous for what were then unconventional methods for bonding with infants. Deena Goldstone, the mother of one of Karp\u2019s first patients, remembers Karp suggesting that she swaddle her newborn at night, \u201cwhich I thought made no sense,\u201d she told me. Karp also advised Goldstone\u2019s husband to hold their baby against his bare chest, in what doctors now tout as the importance of skin-to-skin contact. As his reputation grew, Hollywood celebrities took their children to see him; he treated the kids of Madonna, Michelle Pfeiffer and Larry David.\n\nHe also had a new family. He and Mont\u00e9e met at a party in Hollywood in 1991, when he was 40, divorced with no children. She was 11 years younger, with a 7-year-old daughter, Lexi, from a previous marriage. Mont\u00e9e is from Belgrade and has a highly polished complexion and the kind of thick, open-syllabled accent in English that makes \u201cbest\u201d sound like \u201cbast.\u201d (Her uncle is Milan Panic, a pharmaceutical multimillionaire and former prime minister of Yugoslavia.) Karp appeared to her so unassuming that when he told her that he took care of the hosts\u2019 son, \u201cI thought, Oh, he\u2019s their \u2018manny,\u2019 \u201d Mont\u00e9e told me.\n\nIn 2000, a famous actress brought in her young son to see Karp. She was accompanied by her baby nurse, a British woman named Tracy Hogg. Karp demonstrated his methods for soothing babies, including swaddling and his theory about the calming reflex. About six months later, he says, he heard that Hogg was working on a manuscript about how to calm a baby. That book, called \u201cSecrets of the Baby Whisperer,\u201d went on to become a best seller later that year: \u201cYou have to re-create the womb,\u201d it advises, before going on to recommend swaddling infants tightly. \u201cIt had nothing to do with my stuff,\u201d Karp said diplomatically. \u201cBut it got publishers interested.\u201d Hogg, who died in 2004, advocated what she called a \u201cstructured routine\u201d for a newborn \u2014 with precise hours for feeding, \u201cactivity,\u201d sleeping and \u201cyou\u201d time. Karp got to work on his own book, wanting to document his techniques for calming crying while promoting a more lenient approach. He visited his patients at home in order to test out his theories. \u201cI needed to understand, When does it not work?\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to see it in the wild.\u201d He often worked through the night, reciting bullet-pointed thoughts into dictation software because he was frustrated by the pace of his typing, then drove Lexi to school in the mornings wearing the same outfit as the day before.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

That morning, Mont\u00e9e gave her husband a pep talk. \u201cAct like you have a million dollars in your backpack,\u201d she told him, a joke that is now part of the family lore. She turned out to be right: Karp ended up securing a $1.1 million advance for \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block,\u201d along with a sequel for toddlers. Karp describes Mont\u00e9e as the one in the household who \u201cseals the deal.\u201d At Happiest Baby Inc., she is in charge of business strategy and creative direction (\u201cAs a co-founder, Ruth, I\u2019m so excited,\u201d she told me more than once, having mastered the marketing technique of first-name repetition).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA segment on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in 2002 helped cement Karp\u2019s success, and Mont\u00e9e had the idea of bringing the book\u2019s testimonial sections to life by recording Karp\u2019s interactions with his patients on DVD. Their timing couldn\u2019t have been better. \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block\u201d came out just as parenting literature was undergoing a transition of its own.\n\nFor years, the prevailing philosophy on child rearing had been Dr. Benjamin Spock\u2019s rallying call to parents: \u201cTrust yourself. You know more than you think you do.\u201d Spock\u2019s \u201cThe Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care,\u201d which was published in 1946 and sold more than 50 million copies worldwide, was so thoroughly embraced that some women kept copies of his paperback all over the house, including in their glove compartments. Detractors later blamed him for the permissiveness that they argued set the stage for the 1960s counterculture \u2014 for children being \u201cSpocked when they should have been spanked.\u201d In the late \u201960s, Spock\u2019s involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement caused some of his readers to turn on him. His sales figures soon dropped by half, though he remains, to this day, the world\u2019s most famous pediatrician.\n\nAs Spock lost ground, the field of expert advice became more polarized between a \u201chard\u201d camp, which stressed discipline and conformity, and a \u201csoft\u201d camp, which believed in the importance of bonding and individuality. The issue of baby sleep was particularly contentious. In 1985, Dr. Richard Ferber, who founded what is now known as the Sleep Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, published a sleep manual so popular that his name became a verb. To \u201cFerberize\u201d is now synonymous with letting a child cry it out (even though his book doesn\u2019t quite advocate that). Following Ferber\u2019s best seller, child-rearing literature was inundated with sleep guides, each with its own impossibly alluring title \u2014 \u201cTwelve Hours Sleep by Twelve Weeks Old,\u201d \u201cThe No-Cry Sleep Solution.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe soaring popularity of sleep guides may have been propelled by an observable, objective deterioration in baby sleep, which can be traced back to a single year, 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics, upon reviewing research on sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, came out with the recommendation that parents put babies to sleep exclusively on their backs in the first year of life. The number of SIDS cases did in fact fall \u2014 by half, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. But the change came at a price. Babies sleep significantly worse on their backs, a fact that pediatricians openly acknowledge.\n\nCertain parental concerns have vanished with technological advances like infant formula or polio vaccines. Others \u2014 like our anxiety about said technological advances \u2014 are perennial: Speaking to mothers in 1910, the pediatrician L. Emmett Holt worried about sensory overload in \u201cthese days of factory and locomotive whistles, trolley cars and automobiles.\u201d But sleep \u2014 how much our children, and by extension we, get; whether it\u2019s continuous or interrupted, light or deep, crying-induced or self-soothed \u2014 is a particularly of-the-moment obsession, particularly among well-off parents. The intense focus on sleep may have less to do with babies and more to do with parents, especially middle-class mothers, who provide as much as or more child care today than housewives did in the 1960s. Highly educated working mothers, Brigid Schulte, the author of \u201cOverwhelmed: Work Love and Play When No One Has the Time,\u201d told me in an email, have \u201cmade their children such a priority\u201d that they spend \u201cvirtually all of their leisure time with their children.\u201d\n\nAs baby sleep came to be seen as a national problem, the pressure intensified on parents to enforce stricter regimens. Champions of \u201chard\u201d advice became known as parent-centered. Many of these advocates were from the Christian right, including Gary Ezzo, whose \u201cOn Becoming Baby Wise,\u201d published in 1995, promoted rigid feeding schedules, \u201chighchair manners\u201d and physical punishment, or \u201cchastisement\u201d \u2014 preferably with a rubber spatula. (These recommendations have since changed.) Ezzo\u2019s and other parent-centered advice books grew in direct opposition to the \u201cideological humanists\u201d of the child-centered approach, with their insistence on feeding on demand, co-sleeping and a shunning of schedules and training methods.\n\nParent-centered advocates inveighed against the 1993 \u201cBaby Book\u201d \u2014 the bible of child-centered parents, written by William and Martha Sears, a pediatrician-and-nurse couple and parents of eight children. The \u201cBaby Book\u201d begins with an aphorism that puts many women at a disadvantage before they\u2019ve even started mothering: \u201cFeeling good about your baby\u2019s birth carries over into feeling good about your baby.\u201d (Tell that to the woman recovering from an emergency C-section.) They go on to ask, hypothetically, \u201cWon\u2019t holding our baby a lot, responding to cries, breast-feeding on cue and even sleeping with baby create a spoiled and overly dependent child?\u201d To which they provide an emphatic answer: \u201cNo!\u201d (Their son Robert, who is also a pediatrician and a \u201cBaby Book\u201d co-author, has become a vocal critic of vaccination laws, counter to evidence-based medical consensus.) Though they see themselves as Spock\u2019s disciples, experts from the soft camp can seem exceedingly hard on parents, especially mothers, not to mention downright punitive for anyone with a full-time job.\n\nPhoto\n\nKarp\u2019s manual represented a welcome middle ground. \u201cI try to be an omnivore and just reflect on each issue and judge it on its own merit or lack of merit, but I\u2019m much closer to the Dr. Sears approach,\u201d he said. He emphasizes the benefits of breast-feeding but argues that experts have become \u201cdogmatic and inflexible about it to the point where we could be hurting kids and certainly hurting mothers.\u201d He includes sections in his books on weaning \u2014 from swaddling, pacifiers, rocking \u2014 even as he dismisses professionals who warn that children could become addicted to these crutches. (\u201cAre we \u2018addicted\u2019 to sleeping on a bed with a pillow?\u201d he retorts.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKarp \u201ckind of serves the purpose that Grandma would have served in the past,\u201d Alison Gopnik, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the book \u201cThe Philosophical Baby,\u201d told me. \u201cBut what science tells us is that variability is the most distinctive feature in terms of what children are like, what parents are like and what caregiving is like. So it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re going to find one piece of advice that\u2019s going to suit all the different varieties of children and cultures.\u201d\n\nKarp\u2019s manner is open, engaging, empathetic, inviting confession; ask him about his work, though, and the layers of humility begin to peel off. \u201cNobody else noticed this stuff in the whole world!\u201d he told me at the end of dinner one evening when we talked about the 5 S\u2019s. \u201cNo one knew about swaddling. Nobody knew about sleep.\u201d As \u201cThe Happiest Baby on the Block\u201d began to take off, Karp left his pediatric practice and with Mont\u00e9e turned the \u201cHappiest Baby\u201d into a franchise that now includes three books, two DVDs, a line of swaddles and white noises for purchase on iTunes, as well as SNOO, which rocks and plays white noise continuously and has sensors that respond to a baby\u2019s cry by changing intensities; it keeps the baby swaddled and fastened inside the crib and can be controlled from afar on a smartphone.\n\nKarp earnestly compares the $1,200 bassinet to the advent of penicillin \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not here to promote a product, but I am saying if someone developed penicillin, wouldn\u2019t it be important to tell people about it?\u201d \u2014 and insists that it can save lives by stopping babies from rolling into an unsafe position in their sleep. Raising the money for SNOO, Karp drew on his celebrity appeal: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are investors, as are Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Zoe Saldana. (Or, as Mont\u00e9e put it, \u201cWe have Justin and Jessica and Gwyneth and Scarlett and Zoe.\u201d)\n\nSo far, 30,000 beds have gone into production, and of those, some were given free or at a steep markdown to social \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 a far cry from Karp\u2019s days of working with abused children. Hulu and Activision have begun offering discounted SNOOs as a benefit to their employees. Karp says he hopes to take SNOO beyond the gated precincts of Los Angeles and Silicon Valley: \u201cOnce we get medical studies, we can get insurance companies and employers to subsidize this. It will be like breast pumps ultimately. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nOther \u201cHappiest Baby\u201d innovations can be viewed as truly helpful or slightly ominous, depending on your level of credulity. Its engineers are aiming to update the SNOO app to serve as a dutiful personal assistant, providing parents a full report on their child in the morning, like \u201cBaby Sophie\u2019s diaper is full; she had a runny nose; the humidifier is on,\u201d Mont\u00e9e explained one morning when I visited the company\u2019s headquarters in a squat building on a main drag in Santa Monica. She saw my face. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the beginning I thought, Come on, really? But then I see Lexi\u2019s friends, and they turn to an app just to tell them which breast they fed from last. It\u2019s a different generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, love!\u201d Karp called out to Mont\u00e9e as we walked through their house on a recent weekend afternoon. They live in a converted A-frame chalet nestled deep in the hills of the Pacific Palisades that looks like the ideal location for a dream sequence in a film set in 2030. It has a hydraulic door with a laser-perforated metal screen, smooth white terrazzo floors, white floating stairs and an arresting view of the ocean. There are no visible light switches anywhere (Mont\u00e9e is \u201callergic\u201d) and nothing made of plastic: Karp and Mont\u00e9e are environmental activists, and both serve as directors of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. With its glass facades and sharp corners, their house also looks decidedly un-baby-proofed. Perhaps the only indication of Karp\u2019s profession can be found upstairs, in his study, where there is a first-edition Dr. Spock and a cloth baby carrier from the Peruvian Amazon \u2014 a gift from Olivia Newton-John and her husband.\n\nKarp has devoted his entire career to babies, so it came as a surprise to learn that he has never raised one of his own. For two years after he and Mont\u00e9e married, they tried to conceive but couldn\u2019t. Devastated, they considered surrogacy or adoption but in the end decided against it. \u201cWe had Lexi,\u201d Karp explained. He came back to that decision in a later conversation. \u201cI kind of feel like everyone is my child,\u201d he told me, his eyes glistening. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the barriers. There\u2019s this passage in \u2018Siddhartha,\u2019 by Hermann Hesse, where Siddhartha\u2019s friend Govinda looks into his face and sees the flow of thousands of human faces like a procession. It\u2019s our joining of humanity.\u201d Does this mean that he views all the children he has treated over the years as, in some sense, his own? \u201cAnd their parents,\u201d he said keenly.\n\nPart of the appeal of Karp\u2019s methods for calming babies was that they didn\u2019t require anything fancy, not even the pre-made swaddles that are sold today \u2014 any old blanket would do. As he himself noted in his book, \u201cFor thousands of years, the most skilled parents have used the 5 S\u2019s to soothe their babies.\u201d Now he was suggesting that, actually, the best way to improve your baby\u2019s sleep required splurging on a sensory bed. Effective as his invention may be, its forbidding price reflects an old-fashioned idea: that child rearing is inherently tied to social status, that you have to spend in order to care.\n\nAs the sun began to set over the ocean, the light glinting on the water like sequins, Karp and Mont\u00e9e still had a long night of work ahead. \u201cWe can stay up more than any youngsters and do \u2014 how do you say? Overnighters?\u201d Mont\u00e9e said. In the coming months, they would launch SNOO in China, and Karp would go on the Home Shopping Network to advertise it. For him, though, that was just the beginning. He mused about Gutenberg\u2019s invention of movable type and how his contemporaries had been alarmed that people wouldn\u2019t memorize anything anymore because of it. He chuckled. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in the way of progress,\u201d he said. Then, standing by the patio with his hands in his pockets, he put it differently: \u201cThe idea is that I could be in every nursery in America.\u201d", "title": "How Harvey Karp Turned Baby Sleep Into Big Business", "authors": ["Ruth Margalit"]}
{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "ON VALENTINE\u2019S DAY 1981 Deborah Harry was the headlining musical guest on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d A product of the fertile downtown Manhattan musical scene, centered around the CBGB club on the Bowery, she had gone pop with a series of hit singles, including Blondie\u2019s \u201cRapture,\u201d which reached No. 1 in 1981. The track, a tribute to an uptown musical culture that most Americans viewed as a curiosity or fad (if they had any awareness of it at all), name-checked a few seminal New York figures, including Grandmaster Flash, the pioneering D.J. whose group the Furious Five formed in 1976 and broke musical ground at house parties in the South Bronx before cracking into the Top 100 in 1982 with the socially conscious rap anthem \u201cThe Message,\u201d and Fab 5 Freddy, a Brooklyn-based graffiti artist who acted as a liaison between street artists, the commercial art world and downtown clubs. At the urging of Blondie\u2019s Harry and the band\u2019s guitarist Chris Stein, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d booked the Bronx\u2019s Funky 4 + 1 (four male rappers and pioneering female M.C. Sha-Rock) to perform their single \u201cThat\u2019s the Joint\u201d for the show\u2019s final number of the night. Harry\u2019s rapped verse on \u201cRapture\u201d was, for most people, a proxy introduction to hip-hop, but it was the Funky 4 + 1 that gave network television viewers the first true taste of what young New Yorkers had been experiencing in parks, subways and schoolyards for several years already.\n\nThis culture, just starting to be described under the umbrella phrase \u201chip-hop,\u201d would emerge from its Bronx and Harlem origins during 1981 to \u201983, engaging in a dialogue with the city\u2019s other musical cultures that would extend its influence. The Funky 4 + 1\u2019s 1980 \u201cThat\u2019s the Joint\u201d is a great example of how hip-hop\u2019s particular vernacular helped propel the culture forward. The idea that something was \u201cthe joint,\u201d meaning something was exciting or pleasing, had been street slang for several summers before this 12-inch single was released. (Spike Lee still labels his films \u201ca Spike Lee Joint\u201d reflecting his growing up in Brooklyn in the \u201970s.) \u201cThat\u2019s the Joint\u201d is significant in another aspect: It took a New York street slang word and introduced it to the wider world, something that became a signature of rap records. Superlatives like \u201cfresh,\u201d \u201cstoopid,\u201d \u201cdef\u201d and the ever enduring \u201cdope\u201d moved from the streets to recordings to advertising to daily usage. Hip-hop records like \u201cThat\u2019s the Joint\u201d literally remixed the way people talk.", "title": "How Hip-Hop Transformed New York", "authors": []}

These included making the maximum penalty for insulting the king four months rather than three, so that it would match the penalty for verbally abusing civil servants working in stressful situations, and making it clear that the monarch does not have to personally report violations.\n\nThe line of Orange-Nassau has ruled the Netherlands since 1815, when William I, the current king\u2019s ancestor, declared the country a kingdom (the rulers previously held less ostentatious titles). The so-called l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law currently on the books dates from that era, and took its current form in the 1880s.\n\nAccording to public opinion polls, the royals enjoy tremendous approval. Part of their success is keeping a humble and people-friendly image, said Henk te Velde, a history professor at Leiden University, the king\u2019s alma mater.

The court, based in Strasbourg, France, found that Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression, superseded Spanish laws protecting the royal family from insults.\n\nThe new Dutch law also limits the maximum prison sentence for insulting a foreign head of state to four months, down from two years.\n\nIn 2016, a German court was forced to decide whether a German comedian\u2019s satirical poem mocking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was a criminal insult, after Mr. Erdogan pursued legal action.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was criticized for initially allowing the prosecution. She later said that her having called the poem \u201cdeliberately offensive\u201d was a mistake, given the importance of free speech.\n\nMr. van Dam, the Dutch lawmaker who had fought the bill approved on Tuesday, said he thought the measure was \u201cmore a statement than a practical thing \u2014 both the old law and the big change.\u201d", "title": "How Is Dutch King Like a Cop?

The book, which was announced last August, took the former F.B.I. director about six months to complete: \u201cIt was a continuous process of writing and then getting feedback from my wife and kids, my agents and my editor, and then rewriting,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe final step was a daylong family gathering, where each of my five kids and two sons-in-law was assigned a portion to copy-edit. I offered $20 for each typo and then met in my office individually with each of the seven to review and debate their suggested changes. They made me much better.\u201d\n\nGHOST WRITER: \u201cGhost Boys,\u201d which enters the middle-grade list at No. 6, ties the contemporary story of Jerome, a 12-year-old black youth killed by a white police officer, to that of Emmett Till. Jewell Parker Rhodes says the idea for the book grew out of conversations with her editor. \u201cThe deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and so many other innocents had wounded me intellectually and emotionally,\u201d she says. \u201cI was born a year before Emmett Till was murdered, and his death haunted me as I grew during the civil rights movement and when I became a mother raising a son.\u201d At first, she told the American Booksellers Association, she wasn\u2019t sure she could write the book. \u201cBut I felt this strong calling, and I kept thinking about it, and how I would do it \u2026 It was worth it to give to this generation of kids because they\u2019ve given me so much in life, and I\u2019m waiting for them to grow up and rule the world and make it a better place.\u201d\n\nMAKING BOOK: David Baldacci \u2014 whose latest novel, \u201cThe Fallen,\u201d enters the fiction list at No. 1 \u2014 usually publishes two books a year.

{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "The album earned Mon\u00e1e a Grammy nomination for the song \u201cMany Moons.\u201d She would go on to collect five more nominations across two more albums, both of which starred her alter-ego, Mayweather. For years, Mon\u00e1e remained safely cocooned within the character. \u201cCindi helps me talk more,\u201d she said; through Mayweather, she could address things she didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about directly. \u201cYou can parallel the other in the android to being a black woman right now, to being a part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat it feels like to be called a nigger by your oppressor.\u201d Mayweather was a proxy for all the things about Mona\u00e9 that made others uncomfortable, like her androgyny, her opaque sexual identity, her gender fluidity \u2014 her defiance of easy categorization.\n\nBut then Mon\u00e1e shifted her attention to acting. She made her film debut as the de facto surrogate mother of a young black boy in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which won the Oscar for Best Picture last year; she starred, with Octavia Spencer and Taraji P. Henson, in the blockbuster \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about early black female mathematicians. Fans wondered if she would commit to films, where she could attain a level of fame that can be elusive in music. But part of the reason she was slow to return, she told me, is that her mentor, Prince, died unexpectedly. They were working together closely on what would become \u201cDirty Computer.\u201d \u201cThis was the person that I would literally call and talk to about sounds or: \u2018How should I say this? Is this saying too much?\u2019 I just never could imagine a time where I couldn\u2019t pick up the phone or email him, and he\u2019d contact me right back and we\u2019d talk about all these things that I was unsure of.\u201d\n\nThe music Mon\u00e1e introduced on that dusty afternoon in Los Angeles marked her highly anticipated return. \u201cDirty Computer,\u201d a celebratory ode to femininity and queer people, seems to signal a new era in her career: If in the past she seemed distant, using Mayweather to stand in for the real Mon\u00e1e, she now seems ready to present herself to the public. \u201cRight now I\u2019m escaping the gravity of the labels that people have tried to place on me that have stopped my evolution,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou have to go ahead and soar, and not be afraid to jump \u2014 and I\u2019m jumping right now.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, in February, I was in the back of an Uber, riding southwest toward a subdivision of Atlanta. After a pause at a security gate, the car drove through an upscale, predominantly black community, past typical suburban scenes \u2014 teenagers shooting hoops, people taking out their garbage, men working on their cars. I was heading to Wondaland Arts Society, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s creative headquarters. Its inspiration is Paisley Park, the elaborate compound outside Minneapolis that housed Prince\u2019s rehearsal space, recording rooms, concert venue and countless parties. Several years ago, Mon\u00e1e established the Wondaland label \u2014 one of the few black women to have a label of her own \u2014 and signed several acts, including the band St. Beauty (one member, Isis Valentino, was a backup singer for Mon\u00e1e) and the singer and rapper Jidenna. The Wondaland artists often practice together and appear on one another\u2019s albums. And the compound, where the artists often crash, has become a center of black culture in Atlanta. Much of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was shot in and around the city, and the cast held impromptu gatherings at Wondaland. At one, Chadwick Boseman whaled on the drums and Lupita N\u2019yongo was hailed as the best dancer. They were among the first to hear \u201cDirty Computer,\u201d and their approval gave Mon\u00e1e\u2019s confidence a boost. \u201cI felt understood,\u201d she told me. \u201cI felt like, Man, these are people I admire and I respect, and they love this album. I have to finish it.\u201d\n\nOutside Wondaland, eight cars lined the long driveway, and staccato bursts floated from an open window upstairs. It sounded like band practice, a score being workshopped. I recognized the music from \u201cDirty Computer.\u201d A Wondaland staff member named Kelly greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour. From the outside, the house looked like any other Southern McMansion, but the entryway immediately suggested something different. Thick, leafy palm trees crowded the foyer so densely that I had to wrestle them to get through. A handwritten note asked guests to slip off their shoes. An archway was decorated with a dozen or so clocks, in different shapes and colors, their hands frozen at various times.\n\nPhoto\n\nBefore I went down to the sprawling lower level where Mon\u00e1e and I would talk, I poked my head into a few of the rooms on the first floor, all filled with recording equipment and more luscious tropical plants. People seemed to be having casual meetings in many of them. There was a large wraparound kitchen, where a woman was chopping army quantities of vegetables. On the dining-room table, there was a chocolate cake surrounded by red and blue balloons, a bottle of sparkling ros\u00e9 and a laserjet printout that read in block caps: \u201cCONGRATULATIONS, YOU DIRTY COMPUTER.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe stairs to the basement were covered with green turf, so that even as my eyes adjusted to the dimming light, my feet were receiving the pleasantly disorienting sensation of outdoors. Downstairs, there were tropical plants everywhere; brilliant orange-and-white fish swam in an expansive tank bathed in purple lights. I counted at least five keyboards, eight guitars, two drum kits, a piano, a cello, a trumpet and a saxophone. A stack of books piled on an end table included \u201cWriting Better Lyrics,\u201d \u201cSapiens,\u201d \u201cZen Guitar\u201d and \u201cBuilt to Last,\u201d a book on business management. There was a desk crowded with sound mixers and synthesizers, and a box set of Jimi Hendrix CDs. A minifridge was stocked with seltzer, wine and water, and a bottle of absinthe stood on the desk.\n\nMon\u00e1e soundlessly padded into the room, clad in a velour caftan, gold earrings and rings to match. She was barefoot, her toes painted metallic silver. She had arrived from Los Angeles that morning, and tried to take a nap, but Jidenna, who was in town, woke her up with his practicing. Though she apologized for being tired, she was buoyant. It had been 24 hours since her first two singles \u2014 \u201cDjango Jane\u201d and \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d \u2014 were released, and both were trending on social media. \u201cI\u2019m still nervous, obviously, but I\u2019ll enjoy this moment,\u201d she told me, as she arranged herself more comfortably on a chair next to the couch where I was sitting. \u201cBut I won\u2019t drive myself nuts trying to preplan what people are going to say, what they\u2019re going to think, even though it terrifies me \u2014 I just have to put my energy into finishing.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e, who is 32, told me that she has been circling the themes explored on \u201cDirty Computer\u201d for at least a decade, but that earlier it felt safer to package herself in metaphors. \u201cI knew I needed to make this album, and I put it off and put it off because the subject is Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\u201d She\u2019s still having a conversation with herself, she said, about who she wants to be when she\u2019s in the spotlight. The sanitized android version felt more accepted \u2014 and more acceptable \u2014 than her true self. The public, she explained, doesn\u2019t really \u201cknow Janelle Mon\u00e1e, and I felt like I didn\u2019t really have to be her because they were fine with Cindi.\u201d When Prince died in April 2016, she started to rethink how she would present herself. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fake being vulnerable. In terms of how I will be remembered, I have anxiety around that, like the whole concept about what I\u2019ll be remembered for.\u201d\n\nAt its core, \u201cDirty Computer\u201d is a homage to women and the spectrum of sexual identities. The songs can be grouped into three loose categories: Reckoning, Celebration and Reclamation. \u201cThe first songs deal with realizing that this is how society sees me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is how I\u2019m viewed. I\u2019m a \u2018dirty computer,\u2019 it\u2019s clear. I\u2019m going to be pushed to the margins, outside margins, of the world.\u201d \u201cD\u2019Jango Jane\u201d is an ode to black power and pride that is also a dirge about the struggles that come with that heritage. The middle half of the album is a raucous party. \u201cIt\u2019s like, O.K., these are the cards I\u2019ve been dealt,\u201d she said. These songs include \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d and \u201cPynk\u201d \u2014 the sizzling, sex-drenched songs that titillated the internet when they were released earlier this year. The album winds down with an anthem about being an American, whose sound evokes Prince\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy,\u201d with lyrics like \u201clove me for who I am,\u201d and \u201ccross my heart and hope to die, I\u2019m a big old piece of American pie.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e will release an extended musical film with the album that illustrates and complements \u201cDirty Computer.\u201d The 50-minute \u201cemotion picture,\u201d as she calls it, follows a young woman, played by Mon\u00e1e, on the run from an authoritarian government that hunts down so-called deviants and \u201ccleans\u201d them by erasing their memories. Those memories serve as the musical interludes (the videos) amid the drama \u2014 \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d meets \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d set in a desiccated \u201cMad Max\u201d landscape. It follows a crew of young kids, mostly black, dancing and dodging capture. Longtime fans will recognize the parallels to Mayweather \u2014 which Mon\u00e1e expects \u2014 but instead of focusing on a fictional male human lover, the object of her affection is the actress Tessa Thompson, with whom Mon\u00e1e is frequently photographed in real life. A beautiful man whom she occasionally hugs and kisses makes appearances, but he feels like an afterthought. Plausible deniability. The star-crossed romance between Thompson and Mon\u00e1e, and whether they will be separated or reunited, is the true narrative of the film.\n\nMost popular music is so determinedly centered on heterosexual dynamics that any hint of same-sex interactions can feel revelatory, even radical, upon the first encounter. That\u2019s the way it felt to me when I first watched Mon\u00e1e\u2019s film. The queer sexual interactions are refreshingly explicit \u2014 miming digital and oral sex \u2014 and images throughout celebrate women. The video for the song \u201cPynk\u201d is an extended appreciation of the female anatomy, with neon signs screaming, \u201c[Expletive] Power,\u201d and pink-frilled jumpsuits that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a Judy Chicago installation.\n\nAlready much of social media has speculated on the nature of Mon\u00e1e and Thompson\u2019s relationship, and this film \u2014 especially with scenes like Thompson poking her head from between the legs of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s pink vagina pantsuit \u2014 is certain to only inflame those rumors. The first time I saw the video for \u201cMake Me Feel,\u201d months before its YouTube release, I found it so sexually suggestive (Thompson appears throughout the song, fawning over Mon\u00e1e, dancing with her, almost kissing her) that I immediately texted the woman I was dating at the time, \u201comg janelle might really be gay.\u201d It felt as declarative as a coming-out could. And yet in person, Mon\u00e1e would say only that she felt this was her coming-out as an advocate of women and queer issues. \u201cI want it to be very clear that I\u2019m an advocate for women,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a girl\u2019s girl, meaning I support women no matter what they choose to do. I\u2019m proud when everybody is taking agency over their image and their bodies.\u201d She told me that she wanted the album to be especially relevant to black women and queer women, for them to feel seen and heard in this album. \u201cI felt that way when I listened to Lauryn Hill, as I was trying to find myself as a young woman, I felt that way when I listened to Stevie Wonder when I was trying to understand God more.\u201d\n\nI asked Mon\u00e1e what she thought of the internet\u2019s speculation about her romantic relationship with Thompson. Watching her as she decided on a response was like watching a mathematician working out Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. Gears were churning; calculations were being made. Finally, she laughed, raised her eyebrows and deflected: \u201cI hope people feel celebrated,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope they feel love. I hope they feel seen.\u201d It was late into the evening, and I was conscious of how long we\u2019d been talking \u2014 at least two hours \u2014 and let it drop. But the issue lingered for me, especially the more times I watched her film.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese days, the culture seems more accepting and welcoming of queerness: Young actors and pop stars like Amandla Stenberg and Lady Gaga are identifying publicly as bisexual. Lena Waithe and her fianc\u00e9e were recently photographed by Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair. And yet, nonheteronormative sexuality remains the last taboo. Mon\u00e1e is media-savvy enough to protect herself from becoming tabloid fodder for publications that want to turn her personal life into spectacle or reduce her art to her sexuality. She told me repeatedly that she worried what her early fans and very religious and very Southern family would think. There\u2019s little precedent for a black female celebrity at her level living openly as a lesbian in a gay relationship.\n\nMon\u00e1e has spent a lifetime perfecting the art of being a pop star who isn\u2019t a sexual object. Discretion is a survival strategy, a coping mechanism especially useful for black women living in the public eye. But she has now made an explicit album about sexual expression and identity that is somehow still shrouded in ambiguity. In 2018, empowerment isn\u2019t a color \u2014 it\u2019s a call to action. It\u2019s Cardi B talking about how much she loves her vagina, not holding a neon sign explaining that she has one. On \u201cDirty Computer,\u201d it still feels as if Mon\u00e1e is deciding which version of herself to show the world \u2014 or that this is the tentative beginning of a larger reveal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Magazine Newsletter Get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.

Her parents worked in the service industry, her mother as a janitor and her stepfather as a postal worker. Her mother was a Baptist but didn\u2019t mind when Mona\u00e9 listened to racy R. & B. songs by groups like Jodeci or rappers like Tupac. Her great-grandmothers played organ in church and taught piano. Her biological father sang. She thinks he could have gotten a record deal if he hadn\u2019t battled an addiction to crack. Her mother left him when Mon\u00e1e was a toddler and remarried. He was in and out of prison Mon\u00e1e\u2019s entire childhood. \u201cHe\u2019s sober now,\u201d she told me, and the author of a memoir in which he writes about Mon\u00e1e: \u201cShe always had this distinctive look in her eye that said: \u2018I\u2019m going to make it! No matter what!\u2019 And I believed that she would.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, Mon\u00e1e was enrolled in a young playwrights\u2019 program and performed in talent showcases on the weekend, where she sang Lauryn Hill songs a cappella and usually won. She watched movies like \u201cThe Wiz\u201d but struggled with the same question that all black children weaned on American pop culture eventually reckon with: Is this all there is?\n\nAfter high school, she moved to New York to study musical theater at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. She couldn\u2019t afford to live on campus, so she shared a room at 140th and Amsterdam with an older cousin, who worked nights at the Post Office. They each took a shift sleeping while the other was at work or school and saw each other on the weekends. Her congregation supplied some funds, and Mon\u00e1e did some work as a maid to make ends meet. She spent the rest of her time in libraries, reading plays and practicing monologues. Her best friend was studying in Atlanta and regaled her with tales of wild parties and the camaraderie of black Greek life. \u201cIt was just more exciting than what I was doing,\u201d she said. She liked the rigor and discipline of her school but worried she would lose her edge: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sound, or look or feel like anybody else.\u201d She made the decision to leave New York after a year and a half.\n\nMon\u00e1e eventually settled in a boardinghouse that was directly across from the university center that contains all four of Atlanta\u2019s historically black colleges: Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College and the Morehouse School of Medicine. She went to Georgia State University\u2019s Perimeter College to save money and began to write her own music. Atlanta in the early 2000s was a hotbed for musical innovation, with artists like OutKast spinning their eccentricities and distinct Southern identity into record deals and national fame. Mon\u00e1e began experimenting with her own sound, performing around campus \u2014 in dorm rooms, at school events and, once, on the steps of the library. She made a CD called \u201cThe Audition\u201d and sold it out of the trunk of her Mitsubishi Galant. She worked at Office Depot and during slow moments updated her Myspace page with new photos and music.\n\nDuring this period, she met Mikael Moore, her longtime manager, and his classmates Chuck Lightning and Nate Wonder, who would eventually became close collaborators and form the backbone of all her creative efforts \u2014 writing songs with Mon\u00e1e and directing her videos, which they continue to do. At an open-mic night, she met Antwan Patton, otherwise known as Big Boi, from OutKast. He invited her to contribute to \u201cGot Purp? Vol. II,\u201d a 2005 compilation album that featured artists of Dirty South rap like Goodie Mob and Bubba Sparxxx but few other women. She also appeared on the soundtrack for \u201cIdlewild,\u201d the 2006 musical film starring Patton and Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, or Andr\u00e9 3000, Patton\u2019s partner in OutKast.\n\nSean Combs, the producer also known as Puffy at the time, reached out to her after her work with Big Boi put her on his radar. Mon\u00e1e had already taken a few meetings with record executives, and was disillusioned by those early encounters. They criticized her style, which then involved, sartorially, androgynous suits, and musically, operatic odes to her character Cindi Mayweather. During one performance, she noticed midsong, breathless and sweating from the effort of dancing and singing, an executive casually reading a magazine. \u201cI cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, I cried.\u201d She made Puffy a deal: She had just finished \u201cMetropolis.\u201d She\u2019d hear him out if he came to see her perform. \u201cIt was important to know if he was serious, that he was going to appreciate me and not try to change my live show or my music.\u201d Combs halted filming on his reality show, \u201cMaking the Band\u201d and flew down. He loved what he saw. \u201cHe said, let\u2019s meet tomorrow and let\u2019s talk,\u201d Mon\u00e1e recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCombs told Mon\u00e1e that he wanted to introduce her to a larger audience. \u201cI knew I had to work with her,\u201d he told me via email. \u201cIt was immediate. I just knew she was going to be important to music and culture. It was the same sort of feeling I had when I first heard Biggie or Mary J. Blige, and I wanted to help introduce this artist to the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Combs announced the signing of Mon\u00e1e to his label, Bad Boy Records. They rereleased \u201cMetropolis\u201d and then followed up with \u201cThe ArchAndroid\u201d in 2010 and \u201cThe Electric Lady\u201d in 2013 (as well as \u201cDirty Computer\u201d). Mon\u00e1e went on tour with No Doubt and Bruno Mars and collaborated with Solange Knowles and Erykah Badu. She landed an endorsement with CoverGirl. She was being sent movie scripts. None moved her until she read the one for \u201cMoonlight.\u201d\n\nYesi Ramirez, the casting director on the movie, had flagged Mon\u00e1e for the director Barry Jenkins, and they scheduled a screen test over Skype. When she appeared, her hair filled the frame, even more than her face. He was startled. \u201cI wanted to call her Auntie. I was used to the pompadour, and this larger-than-life entity, the outer-space person that I\u2019d seen live in Oakland with Erykah Badu, and I had to reconcile that person with this person before me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started talking, and it was very clear that she got it.\u201d\n\nDuring the beginning of production, Mon\u00e1e lost a relative to gun violence. Jenkins felt that the story of Chiron, the boy whose life the movie follows as he matures, spoke to her because she knew young men like him, lost and struggling to make sense of their sexuality \u2014 and understood the way strangers can raise you as much as your biological family can. \u201cShe felt it was important that someone like that be centered in a narrative,\u201d Jenkins told me. \u201cAnd whatever she could do to bring it to larger light, she was down for.\u201d\n\nFor Mon\u00e1e, \u201cMoonlight\u201d and then \u201cHidden Figures\u201d were a way to convey the message she has striven over and over to convey: recognition and validation for people overlooked by society. \u201cI was, like, this is just another way to get out the message I\u2019ve been trying to talk about for so [expletive] long that I feel like I don\u2019t know if anybody is listening,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou can show people better than you can tell them.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRain is Kryptonite to social outings in L.A., but bad weather could not touch the mood in the room at Catch LA in early March. There were a few men \u2014 Jay Ellis from \u201cInsecure,\u201d as well as Mon\u00e1e\u2019s team of male collaborators \u2014 but women were everywhere: Ava DuVernay, Rosario Dawson, the director Dee Rees accompanied by her partner, Sarah Broom, Debra Lee, the president of the BET network. The actresses Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong\u2019o arrived together. Geena Davis watched the scene approvingly from a nearby table. The former editor of Teen Vogue, Elaine Welteroth, held court at another. The New York DJ Kitty Cash played songs, mostly by female artists. Tessa Thompson bounced around in a gorgeous yellow-and-pink feathery coat and leather pants, occasionally at Mon\u00e1e\u2019s side. The women had gathered for a brunch that Mon\u00e1e was hosting for her \u201cFem the Future\u201d project to support women in the entertainment industry. Mon\u00e1e had chosen three female filmmakers to make short films funded by Belvedere vodka that answered the question: What does a beautiful future look like? The event was nominally to celebrate them but more largely to gather in one room actors, writers, directors and producers Mon\u00e1e admired.\n\nMon\u00e1e, dressed in a Bella Freud ice-blue velvet suit, matching glitter eyeliner and perfectly matte red lips, walked to the front of the restaurant and picked up a microphone. \u201cThis room looks good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou inspire me and encourage me to be a better woman and artist.\u201d Earlier in her career, she said, she asked some label reps to recommend other female producers and creators she could work with. The list they provided stunned her. \u201cIt was so tiny,\u201d she said. \u201cI was upset.\u201d To channel that anger, she said, she started her initiative to help women \u201ccross-connect and open doors,\u201d as she put it. \u201cIt gives everybody a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nThroughout my conversations with Mon\u00e1e, she talked about her dedication to lifting up women. Some of that didn\u2019t quite square with me \u2014 most of the crew that supports her creatively, spiritually, administratively seem to be men. But Mon\u00e1e\u2019s event felt like a mild insistence that she got it. This brunch seemed like a woman-centric version of a few rounds on the golf course \u2014 a space that emphasized the importance of networking, beyond film sets, parties and premieres as a means to lay the groundwork for future collaborations. Seeing her in that capacity reminded me that she\u2019s still evolving into the woman she wants to be in the world and the role she wants to play.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA few years ago, the singer and actor Harry Belafonte was asked by a reporter for The Hollywood Reporter to comment on \u201cmembers of minorities in Hollywood today.\u201d Belafonte, a prominent civil rights activist who helped organized the 1963 March on Washington where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, took the opportunity to express frustration about what he perceived as the political malaise of celebrities. \u201cI think one of the great abuses of this modern time is that we should have had such high-profile artists, powerful celebrities,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they have turned their back on social responsibility.\u201d Until recently, few publicly stepped in to fill the hole he named. In the past, Mon\u00e1e shied away from anything that could potentially derail her career. \u201cI used to be a lot more afraid of going off script,\u201d she told me.\n\nShe emerged as an activist in August 2015, at a demonstration in Philadelphia she led in support of the local Black Lives Matter movement. There\u2019s a photo of Mon\u00e1e surrounded by most of the artists in the Wondaland collective: Jidenna, St. Beauty, Roman GianArthur, Chuck Lightning and the producer Nana Kwabena. Their mouths are open, midchant, and the look on their faces is determined. They are holding drums, signs, one another. For Mon\u00e1e, the times were too urgent to ignore. Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland had recently died following controversial encounters with the police. She realized she had a voice that she could use. That she needed to use. A few days later, Mon\u00e1e released the anthem \u201cHell You Talmbout,\u201d which is less a song than a chant. At nearly seven minutes long, it calls out the names of black men and women who were victims of police brutality, followed by the urging to say their names. It was a significant moment in her career: She would no longer be cautious when it came to social responsibility. The song came out almost a year before Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s breaking-chains \u201cFreedom\u201d or Solange Knowles\u2019s primal scream on \u201cA Seat at the Table.\u201d A few months later, Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler gave a benefit concert in Flint, Mich., to raise money for the clean-water-deprived city that was also a boycott of the Oscars. Mon\u00e1e performed alongside Stevie Wonder, Vic Mensa and Hannibal Buress. Mona\u00e9 told me that in the past, she tended to write anthems for other people. \u201cI don\u2019t always live them, I don\u2019t. And I\u2019m learning more and more to live them, to make myself live them.\u201d\n\nHer highest-profile moment came with the 2017 presidential inauguration. Mon\u00e1e was invited to speak \u2014 as well as sing \u2014 at the Women\u2019s March by Ginny Suss, a member of the organizing committee in charge of music. Suss wanted artists whose music reflected their personal politic. \u201cWhen you look at the arc of her career, there has always been a moral core and ethical center to her music, that breaks down constructions of race and gender in our society,\u201d Suss told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool to imagine the world we want through the accessibility of pop music. Having her stand up and have that voice at the march was amazing.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e had heard that Lucia McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis; Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin; and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, were going to be there, too, and she wanted to offer support. She herself was still reeling from the election, she added. \u201cI just wanted to come and not only uplift, but I wanted to be uplifted, too.\u201d As she made her way backstage, she got a sense of the crowd for the first time. \u201cI saw, like, tens of thousands \u2014 hundreds of thousands of women and men and people from all around the world, babies and Muslims and trans and L.G.B.T. folks,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, Oh, my God.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected such a tremendous turnout, for so many people to care about what happens to women. The importance of the task hit her. But there was no privacy backstage, no place to prepare or gather her thoughts \u2014 just a communal room where the speakers were chatting and taking photographs. Mon\u00e1e had no choice but to wing it. \u201cThat was just one of those moments where I was just, like, It might not come out right, but as long as your intentions are pure, as long as you\u2019re honest,\u201d she told me. She drew from the mixture of emotions stirred up by her recent role in \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about female African-American mathematicians suffering from discrimination even as they performed pivotal jobs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the American space race of the 1960s. \u201cEverything that was going on in January felt like that era, when we\u2019re talking about a blatant war on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nShe appeared calm as she addressed the enormous crowd. \u201cWomen will be hidden no more,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have names. We are complete human beings.\u201d For many people, the speech cast Mon\u00e1e in a new light: she became more than a psychedelic Tim Burton character. The response galvanized her. \u201cI just had to speak from my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a lot of artists do it.\u201d\n\nThis January, she took the stage at the Grammys, where she delivered a short speech to introduce the singer Kesha, who\u2019d had a legal battle with her former producer Dr. Luke. A member of TimesUp, a Hollywood initiative to fight sexual harassment, Mon\u00e1e wore its pin proudly on her black suit as she called out the music industry for its epidemic patterns of sexual harassment and assault. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d she said to the crowd. \u201cJust as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us well.\u201d\n\nIn Atlanta, after our conversation at Wondaland, Mon\u00e1e seemed to get a second wind. The band upstairs had resumed practicing for her forthcoming tour, and she wanted to check in on their progress. She invited me to join her. If the basement was where ideas began to gestate, then the room she led me to was where they were polished before leaving the house. It had a ballet barre and floor-to-ceiling mirrors. She disappeared for a few minutes before returning in black leggings and the same cropped moto jacket from the presentation in Los Angeles.\n\nMon\u00e1e greeted everyone in her band \u2014 the drummer, keyboard player, guitarist and two backup singers \u2014 hugging them and taking a few moments to inquire about their health, their families, their side projects, before taking her position in front of them. She patted her pockets, searching for a missing item, which she spied on a speaker: mirrored sunglasses. She put them on and nodded to the band. They launched into \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d and then \u201cI Got the Juice,\u201d and she ran through them a few times, losing herself a little more in the music during each performance.\n\nDespite the accolades and Grammy nominations, Mon\u00e1e has yet to achieve significant commercial success. If there\u2019s a moment that her entire discography has been building toward, it is right now, with this release. Her desire for a win shone nakedly. She sneaked coy peeks at me to see if I was paying attention. It was impossible to tear my eyes away, not to want for her what she so clearly wants for herself. At the completion of each song, Mon\u00e1e would grin, breathless. \u201cThat\u2019s going to sound so good live,\u201d she said, happily. But then the perfectionist came out again. She asked the band what else they had prepared. The sheepish answer came: Nothing. She paused, letting her displeasure seep out for few moments, just enough for them to know that they\u2019d need to step it up. \u201cWell, all right, then,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go through them again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn all our encounters, Mon\u00e1e seemed as if she was bracing herself for anything, including the worst \u2014 harsh reviews, irrelevancy, dismissals. But all that carefully maintained composure fell away as she twirled and dropped to her knees. Earlier, I asked her what she ultimately wanted: awards? Album sales? Money? She referred to Prince again: He was in that \u201cfree [expletive] category,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be.

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "The winner of last year\u2019s green jacket, Sergio Garcia, quickly ended any thoughts of a repeat performance. On the par-5 15th, Garcia continually attempted to spin the ball toward a front hole location, and five shots wound up falling into the water. Garcia finished with a 13 on the hole, tied for the most in Masters history.\n\nSpieth, on the other hand, was dialed in. After birdieing two of his first three holes, he bogeyed Nos. 5 and 7 to drop back to even. But an eagle on No. 8 got him going. And at Amen Corner, where he lost the Masters in 2016, he started a remarkable run. It was the first time he birdied five holes in a row at Augusta.\n\nHe zipped past Tony Finau, who, playing in first Masters, suffered a high-ankle sprain on Wednesday while celebrating a hole-in-one at the Par-3 Tournament. Finau was cleared to play Thursday, and though he was walking somewhat gingerly, his game somehow did not show any ill effects. He had the outright lead for a bit before Spieth overran him.\n\nConditions were perfect by the afternoon, which played into Spieth\u2019s favor, as one of the last groups to finish. And for the ninth time in just 17 career rounds at Augusta, he holds the lead.\n\nHere\u2019s how the first round of the Masters played out:\n\nSpieth\u2019s Amazing Round Ends With a Bogey\n\nWell, Jordan Spieth\u2019s birdie streak ended. He made somewhat of a mess of things on the 18th (he\u2019s not the first), hitting a tee shot into the woods, then wedge out, then a 3-wood into the gallery. But he still always has the capacity for something brilliant, and he delivered again, deftly sticking his wedge within three feet to tap in for bogey. So Spieth is in with a 66, the ninth time he has led or shared a lead in 17 career rounds at Augusta.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpieth Makes It Look Easy at Augusta\n\nFive. Five birdies in a row for Jordan Spieth. The 2015 Masters winner has never done that before at Augusta. But even when things aren\u2019t looking so great \u2014 like his tee shot on 17, which hit some tree limbs \u2014 the ball still bounced into favorable position in the fairway and he took advantage. Tremendous performance. Now 7-under par.\n\nSpieth Continues Birdie Run to Build 2-Stroke Lead\n\nMake it four straight birdies for Jordan Spieth. He\u2019s so confident with his swing that he didn\u2019t even need to look where his tee shot on the 172-yard par-3 16th wound up. He knew it was good when he hit it and just walked straight over to his caddie, Michael Greller, to grab his putter. He would like what he saw: a tap-in to take a two-stroke lead. The cup must look the size of Grand Canyon right now for Spieth.\n\nJordan Spieth Makes Three Straight Birdies for the Lead\n\nConditions at Augusta National have been almost idyllic, and Jordan Spieth is taking advantage. After an errant tee shot left on the par-5 15th, he had to lay up in front of the water. But he stuck his 90-yard approach within just a few feet and made the putt to grab sole possession of the lead at five-under par. Spieth has now birdied three in a row. The eagle on eight really jump-started his round after two bogeys.\n\nTony Finau Finishes With a Share of Lead\n\nAfter a beautiful drive on the last hole, Tony Finau made one of his only mistakes on the day, missing left with his approach and then leaving himself with a long putt. But if we\u2019ve learned anything today, it\u2019s that the 28-year-old Tongan-American is pretty resilient. He made the delicate 13-foot putt to record a 68, currently tied for the lead with Jordan Spieth. The 18th had been a great equalizer on Thursday. Four players came to the 18th with at least a share of the lead, and all four had bogeyed before Finau.\n\nRory McIlroy in the Mix at 1-Under\n\nRory McIlroy is plodding along steadily at 1-under. His tee shot on the par-3 12th sailed right over the pin and off the green, but he was able to putt it back on to save par. He\u2019s been great off the tee but a three-putt on No. 7 is his only blemish on the round as he heads to the 13th hole.\n\nTony Finau Leads, Sprained Ankle and All\n\nHe suffered a high-ankle sprain, yesterday, while celebrating a hole-in-one in the par-3 tournament. But that hasn\u2019t slowed down Tony Finau in his first Masters appearance. He\u2019s been walking gingerly but is somehow now tied for the lead at four-under through 12.\n\nHenrik Stenson Fall Out of Lead on No. 18\n\nTrouble on the 18th hole cost Henrik Stenson a stroke as he finishes at three-under par, one stroke behind Charley Hoffman and Adam Hadwin for the lead. Stenson has never finished in the top 10 at the Masters, so he changed his strategy by dropping his trusty 3-wood in favor of his driver on most holes. He hit 10 of 14 fairways, so that wasn\u2019t bad. But on 18, he hit a poor chip that left him with a long putt that he missed to bogey.\n\nJordan Spieth Runs Into \u2014 and Out of \u2014 Trouble\n\nAfter birdieing two of the first three holes, Jordan Spieth bogeyed Nos. 5 and 7 to drop back to even par. But he just eagled the par-5 8th for a big rebound as he starts to make the turn.\n\nPhoto\n\nSergio Garcia Takes a 13(!) on the 15th Hole\n\nThe defending champion has made his mark at the Masters again. Unfortunately, it\u2019s the wrong kind of mark.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSergio Garcia hit five straight balls into the water on the par-5 15th hole and tied a tournament record with a 13 on the hole. That\u2019s an octuple bogey for those scoring at home. He\u2019s now 9-over par.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d Garc\u00eda said after finishing with an 81. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things. I feel like it\u2019s the first time in my career where I made a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 18: Tiger Finishes at +1, but Ends on Positive Note\n\nThat\u2019s a wrap for Tiger Woods. He ended on another good drive on the 18th. Then from 171 yards was yelling for it to bite but it didn\u2019t listen and went just a bit long. He missed the putt coming back and finished with a par to close at one-over. Currently five strokes off the lead, but it could have gone much, much worse after a difficult stroll through Amen Corner. He kept his composure, rediscovered his swing, and finished two-under on the final six holes.\n\n\u201cSeventy three is fine,\u201d Woods told reporters after the round. \u201cBy the end of the week there will be a bunch of guys with a chance to win this tournament.\u201d\n\nBill Pennington: Two takeaways from Woods\u2019s round: Pretty good job of keeping it together today considering he didn\u2019t make a birdie on a par 5; no one can mount a charge at the Masters without making birdies on the par 5s.\n\nNo. 17: Tiger\u2019s Confidence Is Coming Back\n\nWoods absolutely bombed a perfect drive down the middle (finally) on 17, leaving him with a wedge in. Looked like a good swing with the approach, which went a little long, but still left him with a relatively straightforward downhill birdie opportunity. Unfortunately he left his putt out to the right. But still, he looked much more confident and in control with his swing, and that\u2019s a nice rebound from just a few holes earlier.\n\nNo. 16: Tiger Has Reason to Smile\n\nFinally, a smile from Tiger. A great tee shot on the par-3 16th hit the slope and rolled back to give him an uphill look for birdie from about 20 feet. And he gave it a confident roll and buried it. Big bounceback for Woods, who\u2019s back to 1-over with two holes to play.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo. 15: Tiger Still Struggling Off the Tee\n\nA critical hole for Woods, the par-5 15th, and he lost it way right off the tee with driver again. He was forced to lob it up over some pine trees to get back toward the fairway. He made a strong recovery to give himself a look for birdie from around 25 feet, but he left it short and had to tap in for par. He\u2019s been grinding, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nBut a birdie on 15 would have brought him back to 1-over, while Leishman, the co-leader, finished with a double bogey on the hole. Woods just has not taken advantage of the back-nine par-5s, though, mostly because he is nowhere near as sharp off the tee as he looked earlier in the week.\n\nPhoto\n\nJordan Spieth Off to a Promising Start\n\nIt\u2019s still early, but back-to-back birdies on Nos. 2 and 3 have to make Jordan Spieth feel good about this weekend at Augusta. Spieth won the Masters in 2015 and tied Lee Westwood for second place in 2016.\n\nNo. 14: Another Birdie for Tiger, Finally\n\nWoods rebounds with a great birdie on 14. He finally looked sharp with a 3-wood off the tee and then knocked his second shot within a couple of yards. Then he made the putt to move back to 2-over. He needed that.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

A 3-wood off the tee at 13 also hung out too far to the right and left Woods among some trees on the pinestraw. He then whacked into some patrons on the right side of the fairway. After a decent pitch onto the green, he missed the 12-foot comebacker for birdie. He\u2019s now even-par on the par-5s, which is very un-Tiger-like.\n\nNo. 12: Into the Water, Amen\n\nWoods is not enjoying himself at the Amen Corner. His tee shot on the par-3 155-yard 12th went short and trickled into the water. Then he took a while to decide where to drop, looking pretty uncertain. He\u2019s never played No. 12 well in his career, but he did manage to save a bogey with a clutch putt. Now at 3-over heading to No. 13.\n\nBill Pennington: Tiger\u2019s tee shot on the devilish par-3 12th hole looked fat, with a good chunk of turf exploding beneath and behind the ball. That ill-timed contact likely led to the shot being short \u2014 it robbed his shot of a little momentum.\n\nNo. 12 is another of Tiger\u2019s least favorite holes. He came to the tee there today 8-over par on the hole in his career.\n\nSometimes a converted bogey putt is more important than any holed birdie putt. By avoiding a double bogey at No. 12, Tiger still leaves open the possibility of an even par or 1-over-par finish today. Two reachable par 5s remain on the back 9.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo. 11: Let the Crowd Say \u2018Amen\u2019\n\nTrouble for Tiger Woods at Amen Corner. On No. 11, he smacks it into the trees on the right. Curiously, he urges the ball to go \u201cway right,\u201d hoping to get onto the next fairway instead. But no, he\u2019s in the trees. Woods has been playing pretty quickly, but he takes his time over this puzzler, asking that some fans be moved. All he can do is punch it out, and it goes into the crowd again. He still has a way to go to the green.\n\nWoods, now with a direct chance at the green, hits a high lofted chip to within 10 feet. He doesn\u2019t come close on the par saver. The bogey drops him to 2-over. Leishman, who has been nailing his iron shots all day, makes another par and stays ahead of the field.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhil Mickelson Opens with a Birdie\n\nZach Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion, dropped a stroke on No. 11 after missing his second shot right of the green and then missing a Seven-foot putt to save par. That drops him back to even for his round. He\u2019s there with Hideki Matsuyama, considered maybe the best player yet to win a major; he has opened with 12 straight pars.\n\nAnd Phil Mickelson has started off his round on a good note with a birdie on No. 1.\n\nNo. 10: Strong Tee Shot. Still Par.\n\nAnother strong tee shot on the 10th hole by Woods. \u201cNo, no\u201d from Woods on the second shot as his ball heads toward the bunker. But it luckily stays out and lands by the lip. He chips from there to a couple of feet and makes par. He remains at 1-over. Marc Leishman still leads at 3-under.\n\nNo. 9: Another Par for Tiger\n\nOn the par-4 ninth, Woods\u2019s drive lands in the second cut of rough but is decently positioned. He puts his second shot on the green 30 feet away. The first putt doesn\u2019t break as much as he expected; he makes a four-foot par putt. Marc Leishman escapes from the trees to save par, and his 1-stroke lead.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 8: Another Great Drive, but Where are the Putts?\n\nThe eighth is a 570-yard par 5. Woods creams his drive down the center. With 265 to the hole, he can\u2019t quite get it on the green though, and his third shot goes well past the stick. His 20-footer for birdie takes a huge break and is close enough for a three-footer for par. Another par for Leishman; he still leads by a stroke at 3-under.\n\nBill Pennington: Another striped drive by Woods, long and bouncing high down the 8th fairway. If Tiger was putting as well as he\u2019s been hitting his driver, he\u2019d be one or two strokes off the lead right now. But the putts haven\u2019t been horrible, just not perfect. In other words, it\u2019s just golf. At the Masters.\n\nNo. 7: Another Close Call for Woods, but Another Par\n\nAt the seventh, Woods has no problem with his 3-wood shot. His approach from 150 yards is on the green but a bit farther than he would have liked, leaving him with a good length putt for birdie. Going downhill again, he just misses it and remains at 1-over. Marc Leishman, playing in Woods\u2019s group, makes a birdie to go to 3-under, still the solo leader, but now by two strokes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo. 6: After Great Tee Shot, Woods Takes Par\n\nThe sixth is another par-3, with the flag 195 yards away in the back corner of the big Augusta green. Tiger Woods\u2019s shot is a beauty, less than 10 feet for the birdie. The putt just inches left though, and another opportunity is missed. Marc Leishman keeps churning out pars and still leads at 2-under.\n\nBill Pennington: Really a shame for Tiger. His tee shot at No. 6 will be one of the day\u2019s best from anyone in the field. His missed birdie putt wasn\u2019t stroked left of the hole as much as it broke left of the hole in the final 16 inches.\n\nNo. 5: Another Bogey for Woods\n\nAt the par-4 fifth, Tiger Woods shouts \u201cdown, down\u201d after launching his drive. That tends to be a bad sign, and sure enough, despite the ample landing area, he\u2019s in a fairway bunker. He\u2019s out safely and just sneaks onto the green, but has a long way to go to the hole. He goes past the hole with the putt and was tested by an 8-foot comebacker. Just missed, and Woods has back-to-back bogeys to move to one over par. No change at the top; Leishman still leads at 2-under.\n\nRelated Reading: Will Sponsors Return to Tiger?\n\nDespite his troubles and controversies, golf fans seem willing \u2014 even eager \u2014 to embrace Tiger Woods\u2019s comeback. Will corporate America feel the same? Read this article from Zach Schonbrun.\n\nNo. 4: Leishman Takes the Lead as Woods Bogeys\n\nThe first par 3 of the day is the tricky fourth. Woods, from 240 yards, puts it in the bunker in front of the green. He extricates himself but has a 15-footer for par. It just misses, and Woods bogeys to drop back to even par. His playing partner Marc Leishman is now the solo leader at 2-under.\n\nBill Pennington: That\u2019s a botched bunker shot for Tiger at No. 4 and it cost him par. But Tiger hates the fourth hole here \u2014 he\u2019s now played it in 16-over par in his career.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 3: Woods Drains a 12-Footer for Birdie\n\nOn the 350-yard par-4 third, Tiger Woods goes with a driver and easily clears the fairway bunkers for a good angle to the green. His second shot is merely a pitch, and he lands it for a downhill 12-footer. It\u2019s in! Woods moves to 1-under, joining Justin Thomas and Mark O\u2019Meara a stroke off leaders Vijay Singh and Marc Leishman.\n\nBill Pennington: I would say there is a very good chance that Tiger made that downhill birdie putt on the 3rd because he learned something from the downhill birdie putt miss on No. 2. He read the speed better on No. 3 green, having gauged it from No. 2. That let the ball find the hole.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 2: Woods Still Even After Near Miss\n\nOn the par-5 second, both his playing partners find the bunker, but Woods smashes a drive deep into the fairway. His iron shot from a good position 220 yards away finds a greenside trap, and he stomps his foot in frustration. He blasts out and goes past the flag by 10 feet. The downhill birdie putt breaks dramatically and just misses. If Woods is going to win this week, he needs to go low on the par 5s. This was a good birdie opportunity squandered.\n\nPhoto\n\nTiger Woods Saves Par on No. 1; Singh Leads\n\nThe crowd is cleared for Woods\u2019s second shot. He makes it out of the trees and winds up just short of the green. Good shot. His long putt ends up a foot from the hole, and he saves par. Meanwhile, ageless Vijay Singh has three birdies in his first four holes and leads the tournament by three clear strokes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTiger\u2019s First Drive?

A statue of Cuauht\u00e9moc, the last Aztec emperor, stands on a pedestal overseeing the new city that had arisen on the ancient Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Redrawn by the Spanish, it was now a source of republican pride.\n\nWe discover many of these statues in hazy prints of silver and sepia, and indeed this is as much an exhibition of early photography as it is of architecture and urban planning. By 1900, shutterbugs in these Latin American capitals were snapping plush urban parks in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, spaces of leisure for the new bourgeoisie. Both of these cities received radical makeovers at this time, with ostentatious, oversized thoroughfares built on the Parisian model. An unnamed photographer\u2019s family pictures capture Buenos Aires\u2019s lordly Avenida de Mayo, a boulevard built in commemoration of Argentine independence and in palpable imitation of Baron Haussmann\u2019s extended axes.\n\nAnd as for the vintage photographs of Rio, it is hard to look without desperate jealousy. The most beautiful city on the planet appears, by some measure, as the most sophisticated of the capitals examined in this exhibition, though the photographers and mapmakers here had far more interest in Rio\u2019s boulevards and gardens than its favelas, the first of which arose in the 1890s.\n\nIn two exquisite photographic panoramas by the Brazilian photographer Marc Ferrez, dating to around 1895, Sugarloaf Mountain looms gently over Botafogo and Flamengo \u2014 the boulevards and alleys of the capital in seductive harmony with the beach and the hillside. Ferrez also shot Rio\u2019s ritzy cinemas and lush botanical gardens, as well as new infrastructure. A tramway cuts through the underbrush to Corcovado, the verdant peak that would soon be topped by the statue of Christ the Redeemer.\n\nEventually a new generation of Latin American architects and urban designers, less hung up on European models, would transform these capitals once again. There is a hint of what\u2019s to come in a 1927 photograph of Rio\u2019s Pra\u00e7a Marechal Floriano, whose undulating mosaics of white and black would soon be replicated in Roberto Burle Marx\u2019s wavy boardwalk on Copacabana Beach. Burle Marx would go on to landscape a new capital, Bras\u00edlia, that would take national ambition to new extremes. Buenos Aires would invite Le Corbusier, the Swiss apostle of towerblocks and bulldozers, to reimagine the Argentine capital from scratch. Cuba would take a different approach to national reinvention, one that, ironically, has left much of Havana\u2019s earlier architecture deteriorating but in place.\n\nLatin American cities would become spaces of utopian fantasies, frequently followed by political nightmares. But before the new towers arrived \u2014 and before, more recently, Rio\u2019s white-elephant Olympic stadiums and Mexico City\u2019s big-money museums \u2014 they were already cities of dreams.", "title": "How Latin America Was Built, Before Modernism Came Along", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-17 00:00:00", "text": "Liberty has also played a significant role in the rise of Donald Trump. Falwell was an early supporter of the reality-TV-star candidate, staying loyal through the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape and giving Trump a crucial imprimatur with white evangelical voters, who widely supported him at the polls. \u201cThe evangelicals were so great to me,\u201d Trump said in an interview last year. The first commencement speech he gave as president, last spring, was at Liberty. And in August, Falwell stood by Trump following his much-criticized remarks on the violent rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, declaring on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \u201cPresident Donald Trump does not have a racist bone in his body.\u201d\n\nSuch steadfast allyship has prompted ridicule even from some fellow evangelical Republicans. But it makes more sense in light of an overlooked aspect of Liberty: its extraordinary success as a moneymaking venture. Like Trump, Falwell recognized the money to be made in selling success \u2014 in this case, through the booming and lightly regulated realm of online higher education. Falwell\u2019s university has achieved the scale and stature it has because he identified a market opportunity and exploited it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe real driver of growth at Liberty, it turns out, is not the students who attend classes in Lynchburg but the far greater number of students who are paying for credentials and classes that are delivered remotely, as many as 95,000 in a given year. By 2015, Liberty had quietly become the second-largest provider of online education in the United States, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, its student population surpassed only by that of University of Phoenix, as it tapped into the same hunger for self-advancement that Trump had with his own pricey Trump University seminars. Yet there was a crucial distinction: Trump\u2019s university was a for-profit venture. (This month, a judge finalized a $25 million settlement for fraud claims against the defunct operation.) Liberty, in contrast, is classified as a nonprofit, which means it faces less regulatory scrutiny even as it enjoys greater access to various federal handouts.\n\nBy 2017, Liberty students were receiving more than $772 million in total aid from the U.S. Department of Education \u2014 nearly $100 million of it in the form of Pell grants and the rest in federal student loans. Among universities nationwide, it ranked sixth in federal aid. Liberty students also received Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, some $42 million in 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available. Although some of that money went to textbooks and nontuition expenses, a vast majority of Liberty\u2019s total revenue that year, which was just above $1 billion, came from taxpayer-funded sources.\n\nAnd it was no secret which part of the university was generating most of that revenue, said Chris Gaumer, a Liberty graduate and former professor of English there. \u201cWhen I was there, at faculty meetings the commentary was that online was funding the school, while they were trying to just break even on the residential side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was understood that on the online side, they were making a killing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nJerry Falwell Sr. was raised in Lynchburg by a Christian mother and a nonbelieving father, whose knack for business gained him a small empire of restaurants, bus lines, nightclubs and gas stations and eventually carried him into bootlegging. Falwell cast this dual inheritance in the terms of a clash between God and the Enemy, but it was hard not to see his career as a successful fusing of his parents\u2019 influences, salesmanship wrapped in Christian cloth.\n\nHe founded Thomas Road Baptist Church in the former offices of a bottling company in 1956 and soon began broadcasting recordings of his sermons on regional radio and television. In 1971, the same year his \u201cOld Time Gospel Hour\u201d went national, he founded Lynchburg Baptist College, subsidizing it with revenues from the show. \u201cI believe there are thousands of young students who will catch the vision and who will carry what God is doing in Lynchburg to cities all over the continent and around the world,\u201d he declared at the time, according to his 1996 autobiography. At first the college was scattered in rented spaces around town \u2014 a vacant high school, a Ramada Inn \u2014 but by 1977 it had been renamed Liberty Baptist College and moved up to an initial 2,000-acre swath of land on the mountain.\n\nBy 1984, nearly 400 local broadcasters around the nation were carrying \u201cThe Old Time Gospel Hour.\u201d The toll-free number flashing on the screen reportedly helped bring in more than $72 million per year in donations. Some $10 million of those funds flowed to the college, which at that point numbered about 4,500 students. Another of Falwell\u2019s enterprises pulled in about $12 million a year \u2014 the Moral Majority, an attempt to build a cross-denominational political coalition against the common foes of abortion rights and, as he later put it, \u201cmoral permissiveness, family breakdown and general capitulation to evil and to foreign policies such as Marxism-Leninism.\u201d\n\nLiberty University, as it has been named since 1985, grew steadily, drawing families attracted by the \u201cLiberty Way,\u201d which forbade premarital sex, drinking, smoking and cussing. In 1987, it secured tax-exempt status, which Falwell described in his autobiography as an existential necessity: \u201cIf a tax exemption could not be granted us,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit would have been impossible to carry out the dream of a 50,000-student Christian university in Lynchburg.\u201d\n\nBut another element of the business model \u2014 evangelical broadcasting\u2019s aura of rectitude \u2014 was about to take a hit. That March, Jim Bakker resigned as head of the televangelist PTL ministry amid revelations of a sexual encounter with a former church secretary, Jessica Hahn, who received a payoff to keep quiet about it; Bakker later served just under five years in prison on a federal fraud conviction related to PTL\u2019s fund-raising. In 1988, the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart declared, \u201cI have sinned,\u201d following reports of his consorting with a prostitute in New Orleans; three years later, the police pulled him over with another prostitute in Southern California.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo such scandals attached to Falwell, who succeeded Bakker as host of \u201cThe PTL Club.\u201d But the bubble had burst. Amid what Falwell later referred to as the \u201ccredibility crunch\u201d caused by the televangelist scandals, the college\u2019s finances deteriorated. Within a few years, annual contributions dropped by $25 million; the college\u2019s debt swelled to more than $100 million.\n\nIn 1996, the accrediting body overseeing Liberty presented a list of more than 100 \u201crecommendations\u201d for staying accredited, including a demand that it reduce its debt. Falwell went on a 40-day liquids-only fast, praying for deliverance. \u201cI am certain that we will become a world-class university training champions for Christ in every important field of study,\u201d Falwell vowed in his autobiography. \u201cAnd I am asking God to give me more time to guide and fund that dream.\u201d\n\nOne educational novelty that Falwell dabbled in, starting in the mid-\u201970s, was an early form of distance learning. Liberty would mail lecture videotapes and course packets to paying customers around the country \u2014 at first just certificate courses in Bible studies, and by the mid-\u201980s, accredited courses in other subjects as well. By the time of Liberty\u2019s financial embattlement, other education innovators had taken the idea much further \u2014 none more so than a man named John Sperling.\n\nSperling was an unlikely capitalist entrepreneur. The son of a failed farmer in the Missouri Ozarks, he joined the Merchant Marine, embraced socialism and ended up receiving a Ph.D. in history from the University of Cambridge. He got a job teaching at San Jose State University, where he took over the faculty union and led a big strike in 1968. His humble origins and early socialist leanings had given him a jaundiced view of elite schools, and his experience teaching a course to police officers and teachers as part of a federally funded effort to reduce juvenile delinquency furthered his belief that traditional colleges were leaving out a whole swath of Americans eager for higher education. He decided to start a university of his own \u2014 not a nonprofit but a for-profit, and not in California, where he had clashed with skeptical accreditors, but in the laxer regulatory climate of Arizona.\n\nIn 1976, Sperling rented space in a boilermakers\u2019 union hall in Phoenix and started offering weekly classes there to eight students \u2014 all adults who\u2019d had some college education and were looking to complete their degrees. A decade later, University of Phoenix had 6,000 students. But things really took off three years later, in 1989, when Sperling started offering M.B.A.s online through Prodigy, the early electronic communications service. Sperling took the university\u2019s parent company public in 1994; by 2000, enrollment had reached 100,000.\n\nBy the early 2000s, for-profit colleges were booming: Access to the internet was spreading, and the Bush administration was employing a notably light regulatory touch, even as the programs were devouring an ever-greater share of federal student aid. Among the adopters of Sperling\u2019s model was Falwell, who in 2004 began expanding the family\u2019s primitive distance-learning programs into what would become known as Liberty University Online.\n\nIn his autobiography, Falwell praised Jerry Jr.\u2019s business instincts, crediting him with saving Liberty from ruin through his management of its debt. \u201cGod sent him to me just in time,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is more responsible, humanly speaking, for the miraculous financial survival of this ministry than any other single person.\u201d When Falwell died in 2007 at age 73, his younger son, Jonathan, took over the pulpit at Thomas Road Baptist, and Jerry Jr. took over the university \u2014 an indication of where the heart of the ministry now was.\n\nAs the Great Recession hit, laid-off Americans turned to online education to seek a new economic foothold. After years of trying to save Liberty by cutting costs, Falwell Jr. said, he adopted his father\u2019s vision of saving it through increasing revenues. In a recent telephone interview, Falwell described the surge in online enrollment as a kind of revelation. \u201cIt took us about 20 years to perfect\u201d the distance-learning model, he said, \u201cbut when we did, that was about when everyone started getting high-speed internet in their homes, and we were the only nonprofit poised to serve that huge adult market of people who had not finished college or needed a master\u2019s degree to get a promotion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLiberty had another advantage over online competitors, he said: its status as a religious-based institution, \u201cthat long history of Liberty being a leader among Christian universities,\u201d the \u201cfaith-based mission\u201d that \u201cmakes us so unique and puts us in a class by ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe River Ridge Mall spreads out on the flat ground below Liberty\u2019s campus, among motels and fast-food restaurants. Like much commercial real estate in Lynchburg, it is majority-owned by Liberty University. In 2013, the mall lost one of its anchor tenants, Sears, which occupied a 112,000-square-foot space behind gray, nearly windowless walls. The retailer was replaced by Liberty University Online. When it first arrived inside the mall, the L.U.O. operation numbered 675 employees; it grew so large that in 2015 L.U.O. began moving its operation into a former Nationwide Insurance building several miles away.\n\nAt the front lines are the \u201cadmissions representatives,\u201d some 300 phone recruiters working two shifts from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., deploying call lists that Liberty gets from websites where people register and search for information about online higher education, like BestCollegesOnline.com. There is such a race to get to customers before University of Phoenix and other rivals that the prospective students sometimes marvel at how little time has elapsed \u2014 just a handful of minutes \u2014 between their providing their information on a website and the call coming from Liberty. Liberty\u2019s tax filings show that in 2016, the university paid Google $16.8 million for \u201cadmissions leads generation.\u201d In other words, advertising Liberty to those searching online for degree options.\n\nThe recruiters work under intense pressure, according to several former L.U.O. employees I spoke with. They get no more than 45 seconds between calls, and sometimes managers override even that short break. There are no formal quotas \u2014 a federal regulation that went into effect in 2011 forbids them. But as one former employee put it, the \u201chighly motivated goal\u201d is for each recruiter to sign up eight new students a day. Multiplied across 300 cubicles, that is 2,400 per day. Of those, only a small fraction end up paying and starting courses, but that is still an extraordinary haul for any kind of education business.\n\nEvery day, according to the former employee, managers send out a report showing the previous day\u2019s tallies. Recruiters who signed up four or fewer new students get their names in red, visible for all to see, and are sometimes subject to a disciplinary conversation. Monthly tallies are also scored as green, yellow or red. Top performers are in the running for a small raise from the base salary, which is about $30,000. \u201cIt was that carrot and stick,\u201d the former employee told me.\n\nA separate division of about 60 people focuses on courting members of the military, who have access to even greater federal tuition assistance, and then advising them on campus. A former employee in that division said that given the smaller crew, the work there was if anything even more intense than in the main branch: More than 30,000 L.U.O. students are from the military or military families.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo recruiters told me they were instructed to quote L.U.O.\u2019s cost on a per-credit basis, rather than per-course, which makes it sound more affordable. Undergraduate courses for part-time students are $455 per credit, or $1,365 for a typical course; master\u2019s courses are typically about $600 per credit. They are instructed not to press prospective applicants too hard on their academic qualifications. Applicants have to submit past transcripts, but any grade point average above 0.5 \u2014 equivalent to a D-minus \u2014 would suffice, said the former employee in the nonmilitary division. Recruiters, he told me, \u201cwould say, \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve been accepted.\u2019 They\u2019d make it seem competitive.\u201d\n\nThe two recruiters also said they were told not to mention Liberty\u2019s Christian orientation until people agree to apply, when this fact is made clear in the user agreement they sign online. It also becomes clear at the moment that the recruiters sign up students for their first classes, typically an orientation class and three required Bible-studies classes. Students often can\u2019t transfer credits for these courses to other colleges, which deters many from dropping out: Leaving L.U.O. without signing up for more courses would mean wasting the money spent on the first four.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFalwell and other top Liberty officials pushed back on some of these points in my interview with them, insisting, for instance, that the minimum G.P.A. for applicants is 2.0 and that recruiters are assessed according to \u201cthe same H.R. evaluation form that\u2019s standard across the university.\u201d But Ron Kennedy, the executive vice president for online enrollment management, acknowledged that the recruiters working under pressure to meet their targets might say otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s a call center,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2010, undercover investigators from the Government Accountability Office scrutinized 15 for-profit colleges, finding that every one of them had misled applicants and that four had encouraged them to lie on their federal student-aid forms. The Obama administration seized on the findings as it began a yearslong clampdown on for-profit education, which by 2013 was gobbling up a fifth of all federal student aid, more than $25 billion, despite enrolling only 10 percent of students \u2014 and also producing about a third of all federal student-loan defaults.\n\nLiberty, too, was hugely reliant on federal money, in the form of Pell grants, Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and federally subsidized loans. By 2010, it had more than 50,000 students enrolled and was pulling in more than $420 million annually. But because Liberty was technically not for-profit, it was spared many of the administration\u2019s new regulations, including its requirement that a certain threshold of graduates be able to attain \u201cgainful employment,\u201d which was designed to hit for-profit colleges much harder. It was also spared from the pre-existing rule that for-profit colleges could get no more than 90 percent of their revenue from federal sources.\n\nIf anything, Liberty benefited from the crackdown. The Obama administration\u2019s actions helped put out of business large for-profit chains like Corinthian and ITT Technical Institute, clearing formidable competition from the field. Though there were other nonprofit institutions with online offerings \u2014 Arizona State, Southern New Hampshire and Western Governors, as well as premium players like Stanford and Duke \u2014 none were operating at Liberty\u2019s scale. The university now touts itself on its website as \u201cthe largest private nonprofit university in the nation.\u201d In a sense, said Ben Miller, who served as a senior policy adviser in Obama\u2019s Department of Education, the crackdown on for-profits offered Liberty a \u201cmarketing advantage.\u201d\n\nFalwell was candid about the benefits of the nonprofit status. \u201cIt insulated us from the attack on the for-profits,\u201d he told me. And it put him on the same footing with other, more established universities. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that an Obama federal government that probably doesn\u2019t care much for schools like Liberty can treat us different than Harvard or Yale or Indiana Wesleyan or the University of Maryland.\u201d\n\nLiberty\u2019s ability to distance itself from for-profit colleges was especially notable given that, by several key metrics, it resembled them more closely than the private nonprofits it was grouped with. The rate of Liberty graduates who default on their loans within three years of graduating is 9.9 percent, several points higher than the average for nonprofit colleges, though still below that for for-profit colleges. Most striking, though, is how little the university spends on actual instruction. It does not report separate figures for spending on the online school and the traditional college. But according to its most recent figures, from 2016, the university reports spending only $2,609 on instruction per full-time equivalent student across both categories. That is a fraction of what traditional private universities spend (Notre Dame\u2019s equivalent figure is $27,391) but also well behind even University of Phoenix, which spends more than $4,000 per student in many states. It is also behind other hybrid online-traditional nonprofit religious colleges like Ohio Christian University, which spends about $4,500. In 2013, according to an audited financial statement I obtained, Liberty received $749 million in tuition and fees but spent only $260 million on instruction, academic support and student services.\n\nBy 2016, Liberty\u2019s net assets had crossed the $1.6 billion mark, up more than tenfold from a decade earlier. Thanks to its low spending on instruction, its net income was an astonishing $215 million on nearly $1 billion in revenue, according to its tax filing \u2014 making it one of the most lucrative nonprofits in the country, based simply on the difference between its operating revenue and expenses, in a league with some of the largest nonprofit hospital systems.\n\nFalwell, whose Liberty salary is nearly $1 million, does not apologize for those margins. Liberty, he said, is simply being shrewd about keeping costs down, while plowing revenue back into the university. He noted proudly that Liberty\u2019s net assets are now $2.5 billion, up from just $150 million in 2007, when he took over. He said he was surprised more universities weren\u2019t following Liberty\u2019s example of increasing online enrollment by keeping instructional spending and tuition low. And he freely acknowledged that the online revenues were going to buttress the residential campus. From Falwell\u2019s perspective, there was nothing wrong with the university\u2019s benefiting so much from the online program. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re keeping the quality up, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a disservice to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that is, is ensuring the future of the university.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStudents at Liberty often quote a favorite line of Falwell Sr.\u2019s: \u201cIf it\u2019s Christian, it ought to be better.\u201d Even those who have misgivings about the university\u2019s conservative culture are quick to defend the education they\u2019ve received on campus. Yet despite its ambitions to become the \u201cevangelical Notre Dame\u201d that Falwell envisioned, Liberty is still ranked well behind that university and other religious-based institutions like Brigham Young and Pepperdine; U.S. News and World Report clumps Liberty in the lowest quartile of institutions in its \u201cnational universities\u201d category. Some of its programs have strong reputations, among them nursing, engineering and flight school. But the college is limited in its ability to compete for premier faculty, not only because its politics are out of step with the greater academic community, but also because none of its programs, with the exception of its law school, offer tenure.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

All of them, in his telling, were being prepared for the same goal, to be \u201cChampions for Christ,\u201d as the Liberty motto had it. But many students on campus, at least, are openly dismissive of the online experience. They take some classes online, for the convenience of not having to drag themselves to class \u2014 and, they readily admit, for the ease of not having to study much. \u201cPeople know it\u2019s kind of a joke and don\u2019t learn that much from it,\u201d Dustin Wahl, a senior from South Dakota, told me. \u201cYou use Google when you take your quiz and don\u2019t have to work as hard. It\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d (Liberty says using Google during quizzes or exams is cheating.)\n\nCampus students are especially scornful of the online discussion boards that are in theory meant to replicate the back and forth of a classroom, but that in reality tend to be a rote exercise, with students making only their requisite one post and two comments per week, generating no substantive discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s very minimal engagement,\u201d said Alexander Forbes, a senior from California. Recently, a satirical campus newspaper, The Flaming Bugle, ran an Onion-style article with the headline \u201cCat Playing on Keyboard Inadvertently Earns \u2018A\u2019 for Discussion Board Post.\u201d\n\nChris Gaumer taught English courses both on campus and online at Liberty after getting his bachelor\u2019s degree on campus in 2006. The difference between the two forms of teaching was startling, he told me. As an online instructor, he said, he was not expected to engage in the delivery of any actual educational content. That was all prepared separately by L.U.O.\u2019s team of course designers and editors, who assemble curriculums and videotaped lectures by other Liberty professors. This leaves little for the instructor to do in the courses, which typically run eight weeks. \u201cAs professor, you show up and your job is to handle emails and grade,\u201d Gaumer said. This helps explain why the instructors \u2014 the roughly 2,400 adjuncts scattered around the country, plus the Liberty professors who agree to teach online courses on the side \u2014 are willing to take on the task for what\u2019s long been the going rate for the job: $2,100 per course. (Falwell Jr. said it will soon go up to $2,700.)\n\nUntil recently, the course designers and editors, a team of about 30 people, worked out of the old Thomas Road Baptist Church \u2014 the congregation moved out of the former bottling plant years earlier \u2014 in a concrete room that got so cold in winter that they sometimes kept scarves and hats on. For editors, starting pay is now around $11 per hour. As L.U.O. boomed in size, they became so overwhelmed by the challenge of shaping hundreds of courses that L.U.O. decided in 2015 to focus designers and editors on the hundred or so highest-enrollment courses per term, leaving the maintenance of the remaining hundreds of courses up to the instructors themselves. One former editor recalled having a professor send a syllabus along with, essentially, an apology for throwing something together at the last minute.\n\nGaumer, who now works at Randolph College in Lynchburg, said the steep drop-off in quality from the traditional college to the online courses was both openly acknowledged among Liberty faculty and not fully reckoned with. The reason was plain, he said: Everyone knew that L.U.O. was subsidizing the physical university. \u201cThe motivation behind the growth seems to be almost entirely economic, because it\u2019s not as if the education is getting any better,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nFalwell acknowledged that Liberty\u2019s faculty initially resisted the rise of the online program, fearing the degradation of academic standards. \u201cThe big victory was finding a way to tame the faculty,\u201d he said. But he disputed that there was any great difference in quality. For one thing, he said, the university made sure that all of its online instructors \u201cadhere to the fundamentals of the Christian faith, our doctrinal statement.\u201d Physical distance was a challenge, he said, but online instructors overcame it by making an extra effort to reach out. \u201cThey spend a lot more time taking a personal interest in the students,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the 65,000 students who enrolled with L.U.O. in 2013 was Megan Hart, a woman from New Jersey with unflaggingly high spirits. Hart, who is in her 40s, started her working life at the glass company where her father worked, too, until he was laid off. From there, Hart made her way into education, teaching communications at the local community college and the local prison. Adjunct courses at the college paid just $525 per credit, netting her only about $5,000 per semester, so she got a low-level administrative job there, too.\n\nHer first marriage, to the father of her daughter, ended in divorce. In January 2012, her second husband suddenly vanished. Hart and her daughter, then 9 years old, lost their home shortly afterward, and she filed for bankruptcy. She and her daughter moved into her parents\u2019 basement and got by with donations from her local Assemblies of God church, where she was active. In 2013, she signed up to take three courses at L.U.O. that would provide her with a certificate in communications, allowing her to become a full-time instructor at the community college, which would reimburse her L.U.O. tuition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHart, who had a master\u2019s in communications and leadership through Pat Robertson\u2019s Regent University, chose L.U.O. because of its affordability and Christian cachet. But in her years of teaching and taking courses, she said, she had never seen anything as flimsy as what L.U.O. passed off in its supposedly graduate-level courses. She had little interaction with the instructor, and the questions for the midterm and final exams were so arbitrary that it seemed to Hart as if they had been randomly generated by a computer program. She spent the open-book exams wildly flipping back and forth through the textbook and course materials trying to find the relevant passages. It was, she wrote to L.U.O. officials later, like \u201clooking for Waldo.\u201d\n\nWhen she wrote the instructor for the second class to ask about the test, he responded: \u201cAs to exam question, I have no clue how the final is run.\u201d He said he\u2019d get back to her. He ended his note, \u201cDo remember that God is in control and he works all things for our good.\u201d\n\nWhen Hart emailed the instructor for her third course, which had a closed-book exam, she confirmed Hart\u2019s suspicions: \u201cThe exam questions are random.\u201d Hart got good grades in the first two courses but was increasingly convinced she was paying for a meaningless experience. She sent an email outlining her concerns to the instructor and an L.U.O. academic mentor, adding that she might quit the third course. \u201cWe will certainly take your input very seriously,\u201d the mentor responded. \u201cMay the Lord bless you richly in your studies and future endeavors.\u201d\n\nFinally, Hart told the officials that she was withdrawing from the third course, even though she had been informed that she would still have to pay 25 percent of the cost. \u201cMy spirit has been so sick over what I have experienced,\u201d she wrote. In late 2013, she filed a complaint with a little-known government agency called the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, which oversees the state\u2019s colleges.\n\nBetween 2009 and summer 2017, L.U.O. students filed 49 complaints with the council, more than for any other institution in the state. For some, the problem was administrative bungling \u2014 L.U.O. registered them for the wrong class, or required a class it turned out they didn\u2019t need, and so on. For some, it was endless technical or logistical troubles that kept them from being able to submit their assignments or get textbooks. For others, it was disputes about tuition and financial aid that left them feeling as if L.U.O. was demanding more money than was fair, and withholding their transcripts until they paid up.\n\nSeveral complainants said they were particularly taken aback by their L.U.O. experiences because of Liberty\u2019s religious underpinnings. \u201cI just expected that Liberty University being a Christian university,\u201d they\u2019d be more helpful, wrote a complainant who went to prison and then became homeless after a stint enrolled in L.U.O. He had been seeking to have his transcript released despite his still having a balance at L.U.O., so that he could resume his education elsewhere; Liberty responded by recommending homeless shelters. \u201cLiberty\u2019s motto is they are a Christian school that is training champions for Christ and they are the light of the world,\u201d another student wrote six years ago. \u201cThat motto needs to be revised.\u201d\n\nThe anodyne responses the students received from L.U.O. were frequently glossed with Christian bromides. To a student whose financial aid was suspended in 2015 after the student failed a course because the textbook didn\u2019t arrive in time, an instructor sent \u201cquiz tips that may help\u201d that included \u201cEat a healthy meal before taking your quiz\u201d and \u201cPray before beginning each quiz!\u201d Other L.U.O. responses included language errors so extreme that they bordered on confusing: One administrator wrote in 2014 about a complainant\u2019s having submitted work that \u201cappeared to have been copied from an unsighted source,\u201d while a professor responded to a student in 2012 that \u201cno other acceptions will be made.\u201d\n\nOther students were left simply to flounder, contrary to Falwell\u2019s claims of close attention from distant instructors. Lydia Terry-Dominelli, who lives in a suburb of Albany, N.Y., signed up with Liberty in 2013, when it looked as if she and her husband were headed for divorce and she was worrying about how she could support herself and her 9-year-old daughter. She decided to get her teacher\u2019s certification and chose Liberty partly because she was an observant Anglican. \u201cI was ready for something that had some kind of value system,\u201d she told me.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Terry-Dominelli failed a graduate-level education course when, she said, one of the assignments she submitted vanished from Blackboard, the online system used by Liberty. After twice failing a writing course and puzzling over what she was doing wrong, she asked the course instructor for an explanation. He wrote back to suggest that she might do better if she found a \u201cnew work space\u201d like the local library. After she assured him that her apartment sufficed and the conversation continued, he wrote: \u201cI wonder if you can\u2019t find a great prayer group through L.U.O.?\u201d\n\nTerry-Dominelli struggled further with confusing assignments in another graduate-level education course. She was starting to feel helpless over the lack of guidance. \u201cI have prayed very hard, and what I keep being told is I am in the wrong place,\u201d she wrote to the education instructor in late October of 2015.\n\n\u201cBless your heart. I am so sorry,\u201d the instructor responded. \u201cI will join you in prayer for you to have wisdom and discernment.\u201d\n\nIn early 2016, Terry-Dominelli was unable to access online the spring-semester courses she had registered for. She took it as a final sign and left Liberty, just a few courses short of the master\u2019s degree she had borrowed more than $20,000 to pay for. In August 2016, having failed to establish a decent income, she moved back in with her husband. Lacking certification, she took a part-time job as an aide at a local elementary school. Unable to afford the loans she\u2019d taken out, she filed for help under the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Borrower Defense program, which is intended for students who have incurred student debt after being misled by higher-education programs. (Her application is still pending.)\n\nShe also filed a complaint with the Virginia agency: \u201cI feel that I was being pushed out of the program and I need to know why,\u201d she had written to one of her professors. The agency declined to take action, finding no clear violations by Liberty. \u201cWhat\u2019s killing me is that I went into this program to try to change my situation,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I\u2019m worse off than I was at the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Falwell bond has if anything grown even stronger in recent months. In October, Falwell Jr. told Breitbart News that Trump could \u201cbe the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln\u201d and urged an evangelical army to rise up against the \u201cfake Republicans\u201d standing in his way. In December, he joined Trump in promoting Roy Moore\u2019s Senate candidacy, quoting the song \u201cSweet Home Alabama\u201d in a tweet on the eve of Election Day: \u201cAL voters are too smart to let the media & Estab Repubs & Dems tell them how to vote. I hope the spirit of Lynyrd Skynyrd is alive/well in AL. \u2018A southern man don\u2019t need them around anyhow & Watergate does not bother me, does your conscience bother you, tell me true?\u2019 \u201d In late February, he joined in on Trump\u2019s mau-mauing of Jeff Sessions, calling the attorney general a \u201ccoward\u201d in a tweet for his handling of the Russia investigation.\n\nBut on campus, Falwell has proved a more divisive leader than his father. In May 2016, conflict over his pro-Trump stance prompted the resignation of the chairman of the university board of trustees\u2019 executive committee, Mark DeMoss, whose father was a major donor to the university. DeMoss previously told The Washington Post that \u201cthe bullying tactics of personal insult have no defense \u2014 and certainly not for anyone who claims to be a follower of Christ.\u201d It also prompted students on campus, including Wahl and Forbes, to gather hundreds of signatures in opposition to Trump following the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. After Falwell\u2019s support for Trump following Charlottesville, several Liberty graduates mailed back their degrees in protest. One protester was Laura Honnol, a banking officer in Lubbock, Tex., who attended from 2003 to 2007. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge climate shift from Falwell Senior to Falwell Junior,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou felt like you disagreed with Senior, but he had good intentions and just didn\u2019t do it right sometimes. But Junior came along, and it\u2019s become more of a profit machine and a numbers machine.\u201d\n\nThe Trump connection is not without risk for Falwell. Some people who worked for L.U.O. in late 2016 and early 2017 blamed it for a dip in applications at the time and said the decline led to an April 2017 leadership overhaul and the departure of many employees. Falwell told me that Liberty has deliberately brought online enrollment down to around 85,000, explaining that \u201cwe wanted to make sure we kept the student quality at a certain standard.\u201d And he said that his alliance with Trump has only helped the university: \u201cFor every student we lost because of political concerns, we picked up two or three inquiries who support us because of that political stand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA relationship with Trump could benefit Falwell Jr. and Liberty in other ways too. One of the top orders of business for Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has been to roll back Obama-era regulations on online-degree providers. She named a former official from for-profit DeVry University to lead the D.O.E. unit that polices fraud in higher education. Claims for student-debt relief under the Borrower Defense program are being considered at a far slower rate under DeVos, who is delaying by two years an Obama rule that would make it easier to file debt-relief claims. And DeVos is expected shortly to roll back several key regulations geared toward online providers: ones giving states regulatory powers over distance-learning programs, establishing clear standards for a credit-hour and requiring \u201cregular and substantive\u201d interactions between online instructors and students. Falwell told me that Liberty officials have had a major hand in some of DeVos\u2019s actions: \u201cA lot of what we sent them is actually what got implemented,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the convocation on the first weekend in November, I met with Dustin Wahl in Liberty\u2019s student center, overlooking the campus quad. He said that the unbridled success of the online program couldn\u2019t help putting him in mind of the profit-seeking tradition within American Christianity, which is closely aligned with evangelical Christianity\u2019s prosperity gospel \u2014 the notion that financial success, far from distracting us from the higher values, is an affirmation of godliness. Wahl told me he\u2019d frequently heard people justify the school\u2019s new wealth in these terms. \u201cA lot of people just talk about it generally, how God has blessed us,\u201d he said.\n\nFalwell rejects such prosperity-gospel talk. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that we\u2019ve done better because we\u2019re better people,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat I will say is that we\u2019ve always operated from a business perspective. We\u2019ve treated it like a business.\u201d And that\u2019s what first drew him to Trump, he said: the kinship of one businessman to another. \u201cI thought to myself, if there\u2019s one thing this country needs, it\u2019s exactly the methods we employed at Liberty to save the school and make it prosper, and that\u2019s just basic business principles.\u201d\n\nAs I sat with Wahl, the spoils of that prosperity were visible all around us: not just gleaming new buildings like the $50 million library with its robotic book-retrieval system, but also, up the mountain, a $7 million \u201cSnowflex Centre,\u201d with a polymer surface for year-round skiing \u2014 the only one of its kind at any university in the country. Elsewhere, the university is completing a $3 million shooting range. But, Wahl said, once you knew about the thousands of people far from Lynchburg who funded this splendor, it was hard to take your mind off them, and off the faith with which they signed up for L.U.O. \u201cYou get a phone call,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s God telling you, \u2018I\u2019ll give you an education.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen we spoke before my visit, Wahl raved about the campus: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cAnd it\u2019s funded by the online program that\u2019s sold to people who can\u2019t really afford college.\u201d", "title": "How Liberty University Built a Billion-Dollar Empire Online", "authors": ["Alec Macgillis Propublica"]}
{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "On the plane, Willoughby took the opportunity to ask Murkowski what everyone wanted to know: \u201cHave you decided which way you are going to vote on the health care bill?\u201d Murkowski told Willoughby that the last bill she saw was \u201cunpassable,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have to get this right.\u201d\n\nWilloughby left the flight feeling hopeful that Murkowski would not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Three weeks later, Murkowski did, in fact, cast one of the three decisive votes that killed the bill. One of Willoughby\u2019s fellow ReSisters, Julie Nielsen, a fisheries biologist with a side passion for health care reform, was so happy that she put a bright pink sign in the window of her office overlooking one of the main shopping streets in Juneau. \u201cThank you Lisa!!\u201d read the sign. In the middle of the \u201cO\u201d in \u201cyou,\u201d she had drawn a big heart.\n\nAt a celebration rally in Anchorage a few days later, 200 people, many wearing pussy-hat pink, showed their appreciation. Over and over, the organizer screamed, \u201cThank you!\u201d and the ralliers screamed back, \u201cLisa!\u201d Barely known outside her own state before the Trump era, Murkowski, to moderates and liberals across the country, became an improbable hero, a symbol of resistance and integrity; hundreds of grateful phone calls poured in, as well as calls from the press and from governors wanting to collaborate with her on rethinking health care policy. Murkowski, a Slate headline read, had \u201cstood up for womankind over the threats of men\u201d; Bustle, a website for women, instructed readers on how to write letters to Murkowski that would make sure she knew they cared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe love-in lasted barely four months. Then came the tax bill. Liberals railed against its breaks for the rich; environmentalists bemoaned a provision allowing for drilling in Alaska. Murkowski stayed silent but ultimately announced a few days before the bill came to the floor that she would support it. The responses to her anodyne Twitter feed, which generally features photos of ribbon-cutting-type ceremonies or Alaska\u2019s many waterways, turned almost entirely venomous (\u201cSell Out!!! Shame on you!!\u201d read a typical one). Murkowski\u2019s vote should hardly have come as a surprise; there is no more core value to Republicans than cutting taxes and no dream more dear to most Alaskans than ever more oil drilling.\n\nNonetheless, it was a blow to those who had recently come to hold her in such high regard. \u201cIt was a tough loss from our end, because we really did think we could get her,\u201d says Angel Padilla, the national policy director for the Indivisible Project, a liberal activist group that had helped coordinate protests against the bill in Murkowski\u2019s offices. Nielsen, the biologist, said this spring that she was disillusioned with Murkowski. The pink sign? \u201cI felt like ripping it up,\u201d she told me.\n\nWhen I met with Murkowski at her Washington office in February, she could evaluate those episodes with some distance. We talked in a small, windowless meeting room inside the Hart Senate Office Building. Murkowski, like the room itself, was notably unadorned (although Murkowski, unlike the room, is photogenic); in Alaska, accessibility trumps formality. \u201cEveryone in Alaska just calls her Lisa,\u201d Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, a state legislator, told me. \u201cShe\u2019s a mononym, like Charo.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLiberals\u2019 disappointment with Murkowski had not escaped her. \u201cYou know,\u201d Murkowski said, \u201cone minute you\u2019re the darling of the world. We\u2019ve come together, and we\u2019ve stood up against the administration. And then when you vote for something the administration supports, everyone says, \u2018What happened?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, what did you expect me to do?\u2019 \u201d Murkowski looked almost baffled. \u201cI\u2019m still a Republican.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 16, about three weeks after the health care vote, Murkowski, along with a few staff members, sat in a rental car outside a hotel in Bethel, a town in western Alaska. They were waiting for someone named Ephraim, a staff member specializing in fisheries, so they could all head to dinner. \u201cEphraim,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. From Juneau. He\u2019s my fish guy. Great guy.\u201d She peered out the window. \u201cBut very late.\u201d\n\nWhile we waited, Murkowski talked about her family: The five brothers and sisters, the husband, Verne, who encouraged her to start her career in state politics while he looked after their two sons (now 25 and 26). The arrangement worked well, but lately even her marriage was feeling the strains of her political life. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten harder,\u201d she said, staring straight ahead through the windshield, \u201cwith the strangeness of politics right now. Because he\u2019s got his opinions, too. And I just sometimes \u2014 well, not sometimes, most times \u2014 when I come home, I am just, I don\u2019t really want to talk about politics. I want to talk about the flooring that you laid in the living room today.\u201d\n\nIt had been a grueling eight months for Murkowski, peaking with the Affordable Care Act repeal vote. She was clearly as appalled as anyone by the combative culture of the Trump White House, the peculiar barrage of gratuitously insulting tweets. In June, Trump tweeted that he had seen Mika Brzezinski at Mar-a-Lago and that she was \u201cbleeding from a face-lift.\u201d \u201cStop it!\u201d Murkowski tweeted back. \u201cThe Presidential platform should be used for more than bringing people down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had my mom voice on that day,\u201d Murkowski would tell me later. \u201cKarina knows.\u201d She looked at Karina Petersen, her communications director. \u201cI wanted it all in caps with three exclamation points.\u201d Petersen laughed. \u201cWe talked her down to one exclamation point,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMurkowski is one of only a handful of Republican senators who have shown some degree of independence from Trump. The Republican dissenters fall into a few categories. There are the critics, the most vociferous of whom are Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both senators who are not running for re-election. There are the strayers, among them Murkowski and Collins, who have criticized Trump and also voted against him on major legislation. Rand Paul, the staunch libertarian, votes with Trump less often than any other Republican senator, but he has also gone out of his way to defend him. Lindsey Graham votes with the president slightly more often than Murkowski and Collins, but he joins them in yet another category: the pragmatists. Those senators have staked out the now-controversial position that they would rather get something done than nothing, even if it means compromising with Democrats. Murkowski, who has exercised her independence in all three ways, has nonetheless managed to bring back to her state its most long-desired spoils \u2014 more opportunities for drilling and more opportunities for building in previously protected wilderness.\n\nMurkowski landed in the Senate essentially by fiat: In 2002, her father, Frank Murkowski, then a senator, was elected governor of Alaska and had to choose a successor. He publicly considered an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin, then rejected her. Instead, he appointed his daughter Lisa, who had been a state legislator for all of four years. The blatant act of nepotism dogged Frank Murkowski, who went on in 2006 to face Palin in a primary challenge for governor, which she easily won.\n\nThat history still seemed fresh in 2010, when Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, a friend of Palin\u2019s husband and a Tea Party favorite, in his challenge to Lisa Murkowski in the Republican Senate primary. \u201cI think she\u2019s out for her own self-interest,\u201d Murkowski said of Palin on the evening of the election. To the surprise of many Alaskans, Miller won. \u201cDo you believe in miracles?\u201d Palin tweeted to her followers.\n\nFrom the moment the result was announced, friends and supporters began texting Murkowski to urge her to run in the general election as a write-in candidate. \u201cLeadership told her not to do it, that she was going to jeopardize the seat and have a Democrat win,\u201d says Andrew Halcro, a former Republican state legislator and a friend who served with Murkowski. \u201cI think at that point, Lisa recognized, \u2018I don\u2019t have any friends.\u2019 \u201d Murkowski decided to mount the write-in campaign.\n\nShe ran as a Republican, but in both Alaska and Washington, the party seemed comfortable moving on without her. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent more than $1 million funding Miller, with the Tea Party Express adding $600,000. Not long after she started the campaign, Murkowski learned, while she was in Alaska, that Senate Republicans were considering voting the next day to remove her from her position as the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \u201cI have basically been written off by the senatorial committee,\u201d she said, recalling her state of mind in a memoir by Arlen Specter, the moderate former senator from Pennsylvania, \u201cand I\u2019m not going back begging and pleading. My relationships will either stand on their own or not.\u201d In the end, she held on to her post.\n\nMurkowski, whom Palin had tried to cast as part of the entrenched establishment, suddenly became the underdog, a shift that galvanized her campaign. Her team passed out plastic bracelets that said, \u201cfill it in, write it in,\u201d with the correct spelling of her name. Murkowski defeated Miller, with the help of traditional Democratic constituencies like women and Alaska Natives. \u201cIt was an unusual coalition for a Republican,\u201d said Mark Begich, at the time Alaska\u2019s other senator and a Democrat.\n\nMurkowski quickly established that she had returned to the Senate, as she told a reporter from The Hill, with a \u201cstiffer, straighter\u201d spine. A month after her election, she voted with Democrats to repeal the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. She publicly criticized remarks that Mitch McConnell, the new Republican Senate majority leader, made about the party\u2019s priorities. The Hill headline called Murkowski \u201cA Thorn in McConnell\u2019s Side.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure she would have liked that,\u201d Begich said. \u201cIt was no secret. She was not a happy camper.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of Murkowski\u2019s best friends \u2014 and donors \u2014 are Republicans. But among her closest confidantes are a crew of female extended family members whose politics range from liberal to staunchly conservative, professional women with whom she regularly texts, drinks sauvignon blanc and exchanges family gossip. In the weeks before the vote on the Affordable Care Act repeal, she was on the receiving end of several group texts from those women, many of whom seemed to be encouraging her to vote against the bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn mid-July, Murkowski sent the group a text with a photo showing her bare, pedicured feet and a thick pile of paper on her lap. \u201cSunday morning with the health care bill,\u201d she wrote. A cousin wrote back: \u201cPeople I run into are telling me that they are worried about you and the pressure you must feel. Like I tell Jack\u201d \u2014 the cousin\u2019s son \u2014 \u201cgo be a leader today. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Another added: \u201cWe are tough, and you will be the voice of reason on this. I can feel it.\u201d\n\nMurkowski went to college on the East Coast at Georgetown and then went to Willamette University College of Law. She has long supported abortion rights and has a strong network of frankly feminist friends, many of whom shared her outrage during the presidential election when the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape became public. The day after it aired, she told Alaskan reporters that the tape, in which Trump bragged about grabbing women\u2019s vaginas, showed Trump\u2019s \u201ctrue character.\u201d She did not sleep the night the news broke, she said, because she was worrying about what it all meant for the country\u2019s leadership. \u201cI cannot and will not support Donald Trump for President,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen he was elected. \u201cThis is good for Alaska,\u201d she assured her constituents in an interview. Trump had made it clear during his campaign that he supported drilling for fossil fuel, and Alaska\u2019s economy is built, to a crippling degree, on oil revenues. Decreasing production and dropping oil prices have created a fiscal crisis in the state, which has only amplified the desire among many Alaskans to drill in long-protected regions, specifically on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, which serves as a home to polar bears, caribou and hundreds of bird species. A Republican president could finally make that possible. But Murkowski also knew that the administration was set on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and many of her constituents had come to depend on it, especially its expansion of Medicaid.\n\nMurkowski made it clear where she stood on certain issues that would come up in the repeal bill. She announced to the State Legislature that she was concerned about possible rollbacks of the Medicaid expansion and said in no uncertain terms that she would not support a repeal bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, which Alaskans also depend on for community health care. And yet, in subsequent months, the bill \u2014 written by 13 male Republicans \u2014 kept turning up, in revision after revision, with significant cuts to the nonprofit organization\u2019s funding.\n\nBy early summer, the young staff members answering the phone in Murkowski\u2019s office were subject to scores of aggressive calls from citizens on both sides of the debate. Within the office, there was tension among high-ranking staff members about what she should do. Throngs of health care reporters chased Murkowski down Senate halls, a stress she did not always handle well. \u201cHey,\u201d Murkowski snapped at CNN\u2019s Manu Raju when he followed her down a Senate hallway to try to get a comment on what she thought of the House health care repeal bill. \u201cWould you please be respectful?\u201d she asked, her own tone harsh.\n\nFinally, in late July, she voted against a procedural motion that would have allowed the repeal bill to come to the Senate floor. Dan Sullivan, Alaska\u2019s other senator and a fellow Republican, told the press that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had called with a threatening message. Sullivan was concerned, he said, that some of the administration\u2019s pro-energy policies \u201care going to stop.\u201d It was a brazen threat to a member of another branch of government, as if Trump had shown up on the Senate floor to shake a fist in Murkowski\u2019s face.\n\nIn those tense days leading up to the votes, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington State, occasionally called Murkowski and Collins, who she knew were under considerable pressure, to offer support \u2014 and see if anything had changed. On the issue of Planned Parenthood, Murray told me, \u201cthis is something they have run on, fought for, worked with all of us on for many years.\u201d\n\nTo the extent that there is any remaining spirit of bipartisanship in the Senate, Murray believes it is fostered at monthly dinners that the female senators try to have together. They are sometimes held in the Capitol\u2019s Strom Thurmond Room (\u201cironically,\u201d says Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat; Murray has said that Thurmond once tried to fondle her in an elevator). \u201cWe play some music; we drink a little wine,\u201d says Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York. Once, the group went bowling, complete with shirts embroidered with nicknames. Murray believes that the conversation was different among female senators than among male ones. \u201cMen, when you hear Chuck Schumer\u201d \u2014 the Democratic minority leader in the Senate \u2014 \u201cand I don\u2019t want to frame it just about Chuck, they share information so they can get information to get things,\u201d Murray says. \u201cWe listen to each other to see why we believe. You can go to a gym and find out if the Republicans are having a vote at 4 and feel you\u2019ve got some power. We actually want to understand each other.\u201d\n\nThe day of the final vote, Collins joined Murkowski, who was talking to McCain on the Senate floor, to provide moral support and find out if he was with them or not. \u201cYou two are right,\u201d he told them. When Pence turned up to try to persuade McCain to vote for the repeal, Collins left to give them some privacy. Collins walked past Murray\u2019s seat, and the senators exchanged glances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the first Republican caucus lunch held after the health care repeal failed, Senator David Perdue of Georgia lashed out at the dissenting senators; later, in a news release, he called for more accountability for committee leaders who voted against the party, implying that he thought they should lose their senior posts. \u201cSuffice it to say, it was a harsh lunch with some heavy criticism,\u201d Collins told me. \u201cIt was uncomfortable, definitely, but I was more annoyed. And I did not go to lunch the next day. To try to send a little message of my own.\u201d\n\nMurkowski did go; she knew she had already weathered worse from her Republican Senate colleagues. \u201cI would much rather have that airing and be there,\u201d she said, \u201cthan find out later that there was another gathering and that they talked about us.\u201d\n\nIn August, when I flew to Alaska to meet with Murkowski, I shared a taxi from the airport in Bethel with a woman who had flown in from a nearby island village with her toddler son to see a doctor. She gave the driver a voucher instead of money: Medicaid paid for both her flight and her cab ride.\n\nLater that day, I joined 30 or so people in the backyard of a community health center that was hosting a barbecue in Murkowski\u2019s honor. The guests, mostly employees of the center and their families, stood in line for hamburgers and Alaskan ice cream (Crisco, sugar, blueberries) and waited for her to arrive. Once she appeared \u2014 she wore a kuspuk, a longish hooded shirt with a large pocket in front \u2014 she made the rounds, introducing herself, thanking the staff members for the work they did and giving a brief speech, her voice just audible over the crackling sound of a partygoer\u2019s hand riffling through a bag of Fritos. A third grader, perhaps the one soul there struck by Murkowski\u2019s celebrity, buried his head in his mother\u2019s bosom as she handed over a jar of home-preserved salmon.\n\nOne woman at the barbecue \u2014 the only one wearing a suit \u2014 had flown from Washington to present Murkowski with a plaque from the National Association of Community Health Centers. She thanked Murkowski formally; many others expressed their appreciation for her vote against the repeal bill \u2014 and for her resolve. \u201cI just really want to thank you for standing up to him,\u201d said one of the community health center\u2019s social workers, a longtime transplant from New Jersey.\n\nBack in Murkowski\u2019s Washington office, her staff debated how to manage her newly heightened profile. Murkowski had no interest in becoming the face of an anti-Trump movement. For months she wanted to operate discreetly under the radar, as she strategized to find a way to get Congress to agree to open ANWR for drilling. In January, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, she approached McConnell to propose that they attach the ANWR provision to a bill that could not be filibustered, and thus would require only 50 votes to pass. McConnell agreed, and soon after \u201cwas when we really got things going, but we did it quietly,\u201d she told a newsletter that covers the energy industry. She wanted to avoid environmentalists\u2019 typical attempts to \u201cerode and undercut\u201d those efforts, she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen details of the Senate tax bill started to emerge in the fall, it became clear that many Republicans hoped the ultimate bill would contain a provision that opened up a portion of ANWR for drilling, as well as language that would eliminate the individual mandate for health insurance, which most economists argue would gut the Affordable Care Act. Nonprofit organizations like the Center for Popular Democracy tried to rally grass-roots activists in Anchorage and raised money to fly a handful of Alaskans to Washington to show up at Murkowski\u2019s office. \u201cI thought she would realize she could not maintain her political success, and her popularity, if she was to repeal any part of Obamacare,\u201d says Jennifer Flynn Walker, the director of mobilization for the organization.\n\nBut in Alaska, most residents knew that she would vote for the tax bill. \u201cYou have to understand, ANWR is like the holy grail for Alaskan politicians for the past 40 years,\u201d Halcro says. For just as long, environmentalists have fought \u2014 and in the past, recruited Republicans like McCain and Collins to their side \u2014 to protect ANWR. But in the end, every Republican senator present, including Murkowski, voted for the tax bill, and for the opening up of the refuge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMurkowski\u2019s approval rating in Alaska, which soared among progressives after the health care bill, dropped lower than it had in at least seven years. On MSNBC, Representative Joseph Crowley, a New York Democrat, attacked Murkowski for supporting the tax bill. \u201cShe got what she wants,\u201d he said, \u201cand that was her price \u2014 to sell out the Affordable Care Act and the American people.\u201d\n\nWhatever the polls said, Murkowski clearly considered passing legislation opening ANWR an unmitigated success. At a celebration for the tax bill, Murkowski beamed alongside Trump. \u201cThis is a bright day for America, so we thank you for that!\u201d she told him. In January, she tweeted her support for his State of the Union address. That month, she also posted a photograph of a Washington Post article that the president had sent her about a wilderness region where she hoped to build a road. \u201cLisa \u2014 We will get it done,\u201d Trump had written on the clip.\n\nWhen I went to see her in Washington in February, Murkowski made some of her typically plucky, but not exactly blistering, critiques. Trump, she said, should not be using degrading and foul language. She brought up Trump\u2019s characterization of Democratic senators who did not vigorously applaud his State of the Union address. \u201cIn my view,\u201d she said, \u201cto suggest that a duly elected member of Congress who fails to applaud you is somehow treasonous, these statements are not only unnecessary; they are wrong.\u201d She glared a little. \u201cI continue to believe that some of the statements, some of what the president sets out there is really not helpful to where we are as a country.\u201d\n\nThe day I visited the community health center with Murkowski back in Bethel was the same day Trump tweeted that \u201ctwo sides\u201d shared blame for the violence that occurred at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Murkowski had not minced words then: \u201cWhat the president said yesterday was wrong,\u201d she tweeted. She could not just stand by and say nothing, she told me, \u201cwhere there is evil, where there is hatred.\u201d That week in August was a strange time of upheaval, with Trump swinging wildly, attacking even his own party members.\n\nI could not help asking in Bethel: Did Murkowski worry, as some psychiatrists were suggesting publicly, that Trump was mentally unfit to be president? She was wearing sunglasses, so I could not read her expression. She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t really know him,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d\n\nIn her office in Washington, Murkowski was again talking about Trump when an aide poked her head in to say that Mitch McConnell was on the line. Murkowski, who was in midthought, did not move but looked at the aide steadily for a moment, as if to say: And? The aide looked nervous \u2014 McConnell had asked to pull her out, she emphasized, at which point Murkowski got up to take the call. When she came back to the office a few moments later, she looked upbeat. They had been discussing something about funding for wildfire relief, and McConnell was apparently taking her opinion under close advisement. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be loved,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that people know, Don\u2019t forget to check in with Murkowski.\u201d", "title": "How Lisa Murkowski Mastered Trump\u2019s Washington", "authors": ["Susan Dominus"]}
{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "That Facebook and Google may emerge stronger from all of this can seem like a distant prospect. The Silicon Valley companies have been under scrutiny for months for the way they collect and use people\u2019s data, with Facebook reeling from revelations that the political research firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of up to 87 million of its users. That led Congress to drag Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to Washington this month for a grilling.\n\nPhoto\n\nGoogle, too, has grappled with questions about its online video service YouTube as it tries to duck lawmakers who fear that the search giant\u2019s data-collection machinery is as robust as Facebook\u2019s, if not more so.\n\nAt the same time, countries like Brazil and Argentina are exploring European-style privacy regulations that will further test the companies\u2019 advertising-based business models. United States lawmakers also showed more openness to regulating Silicon Valley during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony this month.\n\nYet past attempts at privacy regulation have done little to mitigate the power of tech firms. Consider what happened in Europe after earlier attempts at checking the power of Facebook, Google and others.\n\nIn 2014, Europe\u2019s highest court ruled that people had the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d online, meaning they could ask Google and other digital companies to delete search results about them. Since then, Google has instead become a chief arbiter of what information is kept online in Europe because the company itself is responsible for determining the fate of each deletion request.\n\nAnother 2011 European law requiring websites to alert visitors to \u201ccookie\u201d trackers that collect data on browsing history has largely turned into a distracting annoyance rather than changing how companies operate. People often accept the tracking to get rid of the pop-up warning without reading details about the tracking.\n\nToday, the uproar over data privacy has also done little to diminish the businesses or usage of Facebook and Google. Mr. Zuckerberg said this month that the Cambridge Analytica scandal had no meaningful effect on Facebook\u2019s business, which is expected to show sales growth when the company reports quarterly earnings this week. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, said on Monday that its revenue rose 26 percent for its most recent quarter as its ad business continued to grow.\n\nPhoto\n\nSpokeswomen for Facebook and Google declined to comment.\n\nIn Europe, the coming data privacy laws are known as the General Data Protection Regulation. These rules will restrict how tech companies collect, store and use personal data from people across the region. The laws, which take effect on May 25, require companies to explain how they plan to use people\u2019s personal information in simple, unambiguous language and detail what other entities will gain access to that data. Companies can no longer hide behind convoluted and often ignored user agreements, but must obtain consent with a full understanding of the user where their data may go.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawyers, consultants and businesses preparing for the privacy laws said that reining in the large technology companies was not the primary goal of the European legislation.\n\nSome privacy advocates also bristle at the idea that these new restrictions would help already powerful internet companies, noting that is a well-worn argument employed by tech giants to try to prevent future regulation.\n\nBut Nicolas Colin, a co-founder and director at the Family, a Paris-based start-up accelerator, argued that \u201cpeople tend to give that permission to companies they trust.\u201d He said that \u201cstricter rules strengthen companies because they have that key asset that is trust.\u201d\n\nThe European privacy laws may crimp targeted advertising by limiting the flow of personal data, but firms like Google and Facebook still have an advantage because advertisers are likely to turn to services with reach and enormous audiences \u2014 akin to buying an ad during the Super Bowl. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, and Google\u2019s YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly users.\n\nGiovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who was involved in the creation of privacy rules, said much of the impact would be determined by regulators who enact the law and who will be up against well-funded teams of lobbyists and lawyers. Google and Facebook will be overseen by the Irish data authority because their European headquarters are in Ireland. Mr. Buttarelli noted that Europe had staff of about 2,500 across all the countries working on the issue.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

These companies now cannot make data sharing a condition of using their products because consent needs to be freely given, whereas smaller companies are not held to that same standard, he said.\n\nStill, there are already signs the big companies are adjusting to the new privacy norms.\n\nFacebook last week rolled out a new consent form asking users globally \u2014 not just Europeans \u2014 to accept its targeted advertising and to allow features like face recognition. It has also limited access to data brokers such as Acxiom, in a concession to privacy advocates.\n\nGoogle, which spent years preparing for the new rules, has stopped scanning Gmail messages for keywords used to target advertising. And it recently introduced a new marketing product for publishers that shows ads based on the context of other articles or content on a website, instead of relying on personal information.\n\nIn response, privacy critics have challenged Facebook\u2019s new consent forms, saying they are intended to continue encouraging users to share information widely. And Google came under fire for an updated European user consent policy that has open-ended language, which critics said violated a tenet of European privacy rules that requires companies to ask for user consent in specific and explicit ways.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that a lot of people have invested a lot of hope in G.D.P.R., and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to deliver,\u201d said Ben Scott, a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America, a think tank based in Washington. \u201cIt will all depend on how it\u2019s going to be enforced.\u201d", "title": "How Looming Privacy Regulations May Strengthen Facebook and Google", "authors": ["Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Adam Satariano"]}

But mass shootings have become frighteningly common. Anyone \u2014 or anyone\u2019s child \u2014 could be a victim, at a school, a concert, a church, a movie theater or a nightclub.\n\nAnd while a smaller percent of households own guns, the country has more of them, and they are deadlier: Semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 have become the weapon of choice in the largest recent mass killings, leading to death tolls in the dozens.\n\nMost people today favor tighter gun restrictions, polls indicate, just as they did a half-century ago. But the N.R.A. also wields political power disproportionate to the size of its membership, as it did then.\n\nIn 1968, the organization was not yet as uncompromising as it is today. But it used tactics that would feel familiar now.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt flooded its members with sky-is-falling warnings about the government taking away gun rights, and urged them to hound lawmakers. In a letter to 900,000 N.R.A. members in June 1968, the organization\u2019s president, Harold W. Glassen, said that the \u201cright of sportsmen\u201d to lawfully own and use firearms was \u201cin the greatest jeopardy in the history of our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrustrated gun-control backers called it \u201ccalculated hysteria and distortion.\u201d But it was profoundly effective.\n\nIn its coverage that month, The New York Times called the gun lobby among the most effective in Washington, citing the association\u2019s ability to get \u201csportsmen, farmers and gun lovers to put pressure on their congressmen.\u201d\n\nSoon, Mr. Johnson\u2019s favored provisions were shorn from the bill by his old cadre of fellow Southern Democrats.\n\n\u201cStrom Thurmond is hostile as hell, and so is Jim,\u201d \u2014 James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi \u2014 \u201cand they\u2019re mutilating the bill as it is,\u201d the leader of the Senate Republicans, Everett Dirksen of Illinois, told Mr. Johnson in a recorded phone call on July 24, 1968 that is in the Mr. Johnson\u2019s presidential library. (Senator Thurmond was by then a Republican.)\n\nThe licensing and registration provisions passed neither chamber, and triumphant pro-gun forces announced it was now legislation they could \u201clive with.\u201d\n\nTo which Representative Charles S. Joelson, Democrat of New Jersey, responded: \u201cI suggest that tens of thousands of Americans can die with it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Gun Control Act was signed into law that fall.\n\nTwo years later, the N.R.A. helped defeat the re-election bid of a leading Senate proponent of tough gun laws, Joseph D. Tydings, Democrat of Maryland, a man who had won his seat just six years earlier in a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy now the N.R.A. has perfected the art of going after lawmakers who defy the organization. That is one reason the demands of mass shooting survivors and their allies, now led most visibly by the Parkland students, remain so far apart from the measures Congress is considering.\n\nIn 1956, after his house was bombed, Dr. King applied to the local sheriff for a permit to carry a concealed handgun. He was denied on the grounds that he was \u201cunsuitable,\u201d according to Adam Winkler, the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d\n\nFriends and relatives who feared for his safety urged him to hire a bodyguard and armed watchmen, he wrote in his autobiography. But soon, he and Coretta Scott King, his wife, reconsidered and gave up the one gun they owned. \u201cHow could I serve as one of the leaders of a nonviolent movement and at the same time use weapons of violence for my personal protection?\u201d he wrote.\n\nFifty years ago, the death of great leaders prodded Congress to act on gun control. Now, at a similar juncture, it is the death of schoolchildren that has stirred the makings of a movement. It remains uncertain whether the current movement for gun restrictions will result in meaningful reform.\n\nSo far, the main impetus is in state legislatures. \u201cEven in Republican-controlled states it appears there is at least some openness to doing something, building on the foundation laid over the last five years in less conservative states,\u201d said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But he said Congress may not do much unless midterm elections shake things up.\n\nFor Dr. King, who would have turned 89 in January, getting rid of his gun helped him reckon with his mortality and focus on his movement.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I no longer needed a gun nor have I been afraid,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHad we become distracted by the question of my safety we would have lost the moral offensive and sunk to the level of our oppressors.\u201d", "title": "How M.L.K.\u2019s Death Helped Lead to Gun Control in the U.S.", "authors": ["Richard A.

An abridged summary of that narrative could go something like this:\n\n\u201cFacebook created an entirely new tool for connecting people for the purposes of good. We didn\u2019t anticipate bad people would use it for bad purposes. We are genuinely sorry, and I\u2019m personally accountable.

Our business depends on the trust of our community, and so restoring that trust is our biggest business priority. The bad guys can never be fully subdued, but we will be continually learning and making Facebook safer and better.\u201d\n\nThat explanation will hardly appease Facebook\u2019s most severe critics, who want to see more drastic changes. Instead, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s message \u2014 laced with promises of ongoing changes to come \u2014 seems designed primarily to allow Facebook to move beyond crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo avoid making himself a fixed target, Mr. Zuckerberg is wise to not defend Facebook\u2019s most egregious historical practices. During questioning, look for him to be highly open-minded. If threatened with regulatory intervention, assume Mr. Zuckerberg will earnestly repeat his recent assertions that Facebook would welcome reasonable regulation.\n\nThe real test of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s new malleability will come if he\u2019s asked if Facebook is considering adding a paid subscription that would allow users to avoid sharing their data with advertisers. That would mark a fundamental change in the company\u2019s business model, a shift that some say would be required to truly solve Facebook\u2019s problems. Thus far, Mr. Zuckerberg has staunchly insisted that Facebook remain free to its users.\n\nSecond, Mr. Zuckerberg should benefit from his growing comfort with talking publicly about Facebook\u2019s issues. After the Cambridge Analytica story broke, Mr. Zuckerberg seemed noticeably anxious in his lone televised interview, clearly aware that the issue was far more serious than Facebook\u2019s prior controversies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those conversations won\u2019t likely win him more favorable treatment during his testimony, but they likely served as a helpful warm-up before he sits down in front of the full committee and the live cameras.\n\nWhile testifying, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s first priority is to avoid generating a new round of negative headlines by tossing off a flippant, misguided remark, or by being goaded into a petulant state. But if he endures his inquisition with humility, respectfulness and sincerity, he could actually emerge much better off.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese hearings tend to serve as turning points in most major business controversies. Sometimes they add fuel to the fire. Other times, they create a sense that the offending big shot has been sufficiently chastened by a public lashing and the crisis starts to fade.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg will likely be peppered with plenty of barbed questions. But the most important one will be highly personal: \u201cHow can you possibly think that you should not be fired?\u201d\n\nAt that moment, if he can convince lawmakers and Facebook users that he is the most capable and determined person to fix his company\u2019s problems, then Facebook can begin turning the corner on this crisis. And if that happens, then Mr. Zuckerberg can actually say that he walked away with a small but critical \u201cwin.\u201d", "title": "How Mark Zuckerberg Can \u2018Win\u2019 on Capitol Hill", "authors": ["Paul Pendergrass", "Another View"]}

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "Patrick Reed Has 2-Stroke Lead After Day 2\n\nHis birdie streak ended, but Patrick Reed still managed the low round of the day, a 66 that takes him into the weekend with a 2-stroke lead over Marc Leishman at -9. It was an impressive day for Reed, who missed the cut at the Masters last year when he was nine-over par. This year has been the mirror opposite. Three times on Friday he birdied three holes in a row. His putting has been spectacular. We\u2019ll see if he can keep it up with rain in the forecast tomorrow.\n\nNo. 18: Tiger Just Misses Birdie to Close Day 2\n\nIt had to end this way, of course. Tiger Woods needed an inch here, or a foot there, all day during Round 2, but Augusta wouldn\u2019t oblige. And so it went on the 18th hole, when Tiger needed a birdie to put more breathing room between his score and the cut line. It wasn\u2019t to be. His birdie shot, yep, just missed, and he settled for par to finish at +4.\n\nIt will be enough to enable him to make the cut, barely, which is anticipated at +5. He missed some putts and seemed to have issues with his distance control throughout the round. He did birdie both par-5s on the back nine, which was an improvement from yesterday, when he did not make a single birdie on any of the par-5s. Woods came in with a lot of hype, after strong showings at the Valspar Championship and Bay Hill. But it was his first time playing at Augusta since 2015 and clearly there is still some rust to shake off. That being said, he did enough to give himself a chance to compete this weekend.\n\nReed Buries Yet Another Birdie\n\nPatrick Reed is the first to double digits under par with another birdie \u2014 this time it\u2019s his third in a row \u2014 on the par-5 15th. He is the only player to birdie all four of the par-5s at Augusta two days in a row. That\u2019s a good formula for success at the Masters, which is partly why he holds a three-shot lead.\n\nNo. 17: So Close to Birdie\n\nTiger wanted this one. His birdie shot just missed, and his entire body expressed disappointment. Bent head. Bent knees. Slumped back. After making par, Tiger remains at +4.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTiger has made the cut in four of his six events this season.\n\nNo. 16: ... And Tiger Gives a Shot Back\n\nTiger\u2019s stay at +3 was shortlived after he bogeyed the par-3 16. He drops back to +4. The final two holes \u2014 both pars for him on Day 1 \u2014 will be stressful for anyone planning to spend the weekend watching Tiger play golf. The projected cut line is +5.\n\nReed Comes Back With Another Birdie\n\nReed responds with a wedge shot from 129 yards within three feet for a tap-in birdie \u2014 his second in a row \u2014 to take him to -9 after 14 holes and six-under for his round. He has a 2-stroke advantage over Leishman, who just missed a flat birdie try on 16.\n\nLeishman Closes in on Reed With an Eagle\n\nLeishman answers with an eagle on the par-5 15th. His second shot from 224 yards, carrying the water, may be the shot of the day as it rolled to within six feet of the cup. He tapped in the putt and is now just one stroke behind Reed at -7.\n\nNo. 15: Woods Gets Second Birdie of the Day\n\nTiger birdied the final par 5 of the day after an impressive approach shot, bringing him to three-over par. The two holes Tiger has birdied today \u2014 13 and 15 \u2014 were pars for him on Day 1.\n\nReed Increases His Lead\n\nReed\u2019s drive on the par-5 13th veered way out to the right and deep into the pinestraw amongst the trees. He recovered with a nice easy 100-yard shot that clipped a branch but still landed safely in the fairway. Needing a great pitch onto the green, he was left with a tricky 14-foot downhill putt that he buried to take a three-shot lead at -8.\n\nNo. 14: Long Approach Leads to Par for Tiger Woods\n\nAfter a great drive on the 14th hole, Tiger Woods hit his approach long (again). A 30-foot downhill putt for birdie is off by a couple inches, leaving a tap-in for par. Woods remains at +4.\n\nNo. 13: Tiger Woods Makes His First Birdie of the Day\n\nAfter a solid drive into the first cut on the right side, Tiger Woods put himself on the green in two on the par-5 13th hole. He two-putts for a birdie ... and a smile. It\u2019s his first birdie of the round and he\u2019s now back at +4. Woods\u2019s game picked up after No. 13 yesterday so it\u2019ll be interesting to see if he builds any momentum.\n\nMarc Leishman Trails Patrick Reed by One Stroke\n\nMarc Leishman, playing with Tiger Woods on No. 13, cut into Patrick Reed\u2019s lead with a solid birdie. Leishman\u2019s now -4 for the day tied with Reed, John Rahm and Dustin Johnson for lowest round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo. 12: A Familiar Feeling for Tiger Woods\n\nJust like he did on Thursday, Tiger Woods dropped his tee shot into the pond on the 12th hole Friday. Same fade, same result. After taking a bogey, Woods is now at +5, which puts him right on the current cut line. He\u2019ll need a birdie or two to make sure he has a tee time on Saturday.\n\nNo. 11: Tiger Starts Amen Corner on a Positive Note\n\nTiger Woods manages another par on the front side of Amen Corner. He hit a terrible tee shot, but scrambled again with an incredible third shot, which put him about 5-feet from the pin. He\u2019s still at +4 heading into No. 12.\n\nPatrick Reed Extends His Lead to Two Strokes\n\nPatrick Reed blasted a 245-yard second shot onto the green at the par-5 eighth hole, leaving him with an eagle putt. He missed that but tapped in for another birdie, his second in a row and fifth of the round so far. Now at -7 and two strokes ahead of Leishman and Hoffman as he starts to make the turn.\n\nDustin Johnson Finishes With a Birdie\n\nDustin Johnson finishes his second round with a birdie at 18 to post a 68, tied with Jon Rahm for the lowest score for any golfer so far today. Conditions (wind, firmer greens) have made the afternoon more difficult than yesterday. But Johnson, who missed the Masters last year, is now in a tie for seventh at -3.\n\nNo. 10: Tiger Starting to Look More Confident\n\nAfter putting together a good drive and a decent approach (finally), Tiger Woods was looking at a 25-foot putt with a huge break for birdie. He misread it a little and settled for par. But his posture has changed considerably after a tough start. He\u2019s headed to Amen Corner, where he struggled yesterday, so we\u2019ll see if he can stay positive.\n\nJordan Spieth Finishes a Difficult Day\n\nAfter starting the day with a two-stroke lead, Jordan Spieth ended it two strokes behind Patrick Reed at -4. But it was not a total disaster for the 2015 Masters champ. After shooting 40 on the front, including a double bogey right out of the gate, Spieth went two-under on the back nine. He had a birdie look at 18, a hole he bogeyed yesterday, but wound up with a par. All told, it was a 74 for Spieth, who is still very much right in the mix.\n\nPatrick Reed Is Dialed In; Leads by One Stroke\n\nPatrick Reed has the lead alone again at -6. He birdied the first three holes, then dropped a shot after missing a two-foot putt on the par-3 fourth. But he got it back with a 13-foot birdie putt on No. 7. He hasn\u2019t had a putt of more than 16 feet today. Just amazing accuracy with his irons.\n\nNo. 9: Tiger Continues to Scramble for Pars\n\nAfter hitting a massive drive down the middle of the fairway on the ninth hole, Tiger Woods left his approach way short \u2014 after hitting over the previous three greens. He overcompensated on his chip up, leaving himself a testy 20-footer straight downhill. He drained it to stay under the cut line, which is currently at +5.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDustin Johnson Sinks 44-Footer to Save Par\n\nDustin Johnson was quietly making a move after a 73 on Thursday. He was three-under on the day when he got to the green at the par-3 16th looking for another birdie with a short putt from just off the fringe. But his putt trickled past the hole and kept going. And going. And going. He wound up with a 44-foot look for par. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? He sunk that one. Still at -2 and three shots back with two to play.\n\nNo. 8: A Birdie Chance, but Tiger Misses the Putt\n\nTiger Woods has been unable to take advantage of the par 5s at Augusta so far. After a great flop shot gives him a makable birdie putt on the eighth hole, Woods misses the putt to stay at 4-over par. Right now, he\u2019s grinding just to stay below the cut line. He\u2019ll need some birdies on the back nine.\n\nNo. 7: Tiger Grinding to Stay Alive\n\nTiger Woods went with the 3-wood on seven and hit a nice drive. But his approach, again, went over the green. Distance control has been, well, not great. He was left with a treacherous downhill putt from the fringe and he missed by about five feet. He made that to save par. Tiger remains one stroke below the cut line, which is currently at +5.\n\nJordan Spieth Back in the Hunt\n\nDon\u2019t forget about Jordan Spieth. Another birdie for Spieth, this one after a nice putt on No. 15, has the first-round leader back in the hunt. Spieth is 2-under on the back nine and just one stroke behind the leaders.\n\nNo. 6: Tiger Saves Par With His Chipping Game\n\nTiger Woods flies the green again on the par-3 6th. He had a tough pitch, considering that if he went even a hair too long the ball could roll off the green for miles. But he handled it nicely. Seems to be confident with his chipping game. It\u2019s everything else that\u2019s a problem. A par for Woods keeps him at +4. He\u2019s 10 shots off the lead.\n\nPatrick Reed Slips Back to -5\n\nBack to Earth for Patrick Reed after three straight birdies to start the day. He misses the green on the par-3 fourth and leaves himself with 15-footer for his par. He can\u2019t make it, and he\u2019s back to a tie with Marc Leishman for the lead at 5-under.\n\nNo. 5: The Wheels Come Off for Tiger Woods\n\nDisaster strikes at the fifth. A 3-wood off the tee went into the gallery along the right, and then Woods\u2019s second shot flew off the left side of the green and into a seemingly impregnable wall of bushes. It looked like the outfield walls at Wrigley Field. It took several minutes just to locate the ball; even Marc Leishman and Leishman\u2019s caddy were enlisted to help. Finally, Woods found his ball but had to take an unplayable lie. So his fourth shot \u2014 still needing to hack it out of the bushes \u2014 found the sand. By the end, it was a double bogey for Tiger. And now we\u2019re on \u201ccut watch\u201d for Woods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPatrick Reed Birdies Yet Again and Takes Lead\n\nPatrick Reed matches Marc Leishman with birdies on 1, 2 and now 3! That puts him at 6-under and in sole possession of the lead. Reed, 27, has five wins on Tour and a second place in the PGA in 2017, but has never been better than 22nd at Augusta.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo. 4: Tiger Stays Upright With a Tough Par\n\nTiger Woods struggled with what club to use on the 240-yard par-3 fourth, as the wind picked up and he seemed caught between clubs. He wound up hitting over the green and beyond the tee boxes of the fifth hole. That left him with a difficult chip back onto the green for the up-and-down to save par. But after missing that makable putt on 3, Woods manages to clean up this one. And he remains at +2.\n\nRory McIlroy Makes a Charge\n\nRory McIlroy rips off birdies at Nos. 13 and 14, and he\u2019s now a stroke back of Marc Leishman and Patrick Reed. At No. 13, he sank a 7-footer, and on 14, a 25-footer.\n\nAnother Birdie for Patrick Reed, and a Share of the Lead\n\nPatrick Reed had birdies on the first two holes and joins Marc Leishman at the top at 5-under. A fine bunker shot on No. 2 led to a mere 4-foot putt for the birdie.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His first two shots on the par-4 were all right, but then he muffed a chip and three-putted from there, missing from 6 feet. Ouch. He\u2019s back at 2-under.\n\nPatrick Reed Starts With a Birdie\n\nThe final group of the day is Patrick Reed, Charley Hoffman and Adam Hadwin; coincidentally all three were in contention at 3-under. And after one hole, Reed has stepped forward with a birdie to go to 4-under. Par for Hadwin, bogey for Hoffman.\n\nLeishman Continues His Birdie Binge, Leads at -5\n\nMarc Leishman: three straight birdies to start the day. He nearly reached the green in one on the par-4 third, chipped to three feet and made the putt. He\u2019s now at 5-under par, alone at the top again.\n\nNo. 3: Tiger Misses Birdie Putt to Stay +2\n\nOn the 350-yard third hole, Woods nearly drove the green, then pitched it nicely up to within seven feet. His slightly downhill putt wasn\u2019t the easiest but certainly still makable. But Woods missed. That\u2019s a tough one. He\u2019ll be kicking himself for that.\n\nRafael Cabrera Bello Joins Leishman on Top\n\nMarc Leishman has company at the top. Rafael Cabrera Bello makes his fourth birdie of the day on 10 (against three bogeys) with a 40-foot putt. What a day for him.\n\nNo. 2: Tiger Settles for Par After Wayward Drive\n\nWoods will try to get that shot back on the par-5 second hole. His drive hits a tree, but takes a Tiger bounce and lands in the fairway. He\u2019s behind his playing partners and still has 330 to go to the green. So he can\u2019t make it in two, and his second shot winds up 75 yards or so from the green. He makes it to the green in 3 but is still 30 feet away. The long putt glides four feet past the hole, and he gets the par. Meanwhile, playing partner Marc Leishman has started birdie-birdie to take the outright lead at 4-under.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Big Shakeup on Top of Leaderboard\n\nRemember all those guys who looked like contenders when the day began? Spieth? Kuchar? McIlroy? Well, the three leaders on the course are now Rafael Bello Cabrera, Bernd Wiesberger and Marc Leishman. Kuchar was the latest to fall away with a bogey on the 12th hole. He missed the green on the par 3 then hit a poor chip and two-putted.\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 1 Tiger Woods Starts With a Bogey\n\nTiger Woods smacks his opening shot 340 yards down the fairway, far outdriving his playing partners. That leaves him less than 100 yards to the hole, but he hits the iron shot too hot, bouncing the ball off the green, and leaving himself with a tricky up-and-down. His third shot is a miss: It hits the edge of the green and just dies, leaving him with 20 feet for par. He misses the par putt by a few inches and starts off poorly, with a bogey.\n\nBogeys All Around for the Leaders\n\nThings are going wrong for several of the leaders. A bogey for Bernd Wiesberger, a bogey for Rickie Fowler, and now the only players on the course at 3-under are Wiesberger and Matt Kuchar. They are in a six-way tie with four players who haven\u2019t started yet.\n\nBill Pennington: Fowler was briefly tied for the lead about 30 minutes ago. He\u2019s dropped back a stroke, and his Masters history is not so encouraging. He\u2019s playing his 28th round at Augusta National today and he\u2019s five-over par cumulatively in those rounds. Best finish in the tournament is a tie for fifth four years ago. Three times he has been outside the top 25 and in 2016 he missed the cut.\n\nPhil Mickelson Tumbles Off the Leaderboard\n\nPhil Mickelson\u2019s tee shot on the 9th hole was so far to the right he disappeared into the woods looking for it. He found the ball and tried to pitch out but his shot smacked solidly off the trunk of a tree. The crack of ball meeting bark resounded across the hole. Mickelson went deeper in the woods and had to take a stroke for unplayable lie. Then Mickelson knocked his fourth shot close to the green but just below it. His flop shot from there was short, his long double bogey putt ran past the hole and Mickelson finally sank a nervy downhill putt to end a disastrous hole. He began the hole tied for 7th, now he\u2019s tied for 26th.\n\nJordan Spieth Falls Back to -2\n\nJordan Spieth, the Day 1 leader, started double bogey-bogey, but righted his ship with a run of four pars and reclaimed a share of the lead for a while. Alas, he found a trap with his second shot on No. 7, and couldn\u2019t get up and down. A bogey, and he\u2019s two back now.\n\nBernd Wiesberger Alone at the Top\n\nBreakthrough! We have a solo leader at 4-under and it\u2019s ... Bernd Wiesberger? Yep, Wiesberger made a 15-footer for birdie on No. 3 to go to 2-under on the day. Wiesberger, 32, has a few European tour wins, but has never been better than 15th at a major.\n\nPhoto\n\nRickie Fowler Makes Another Big Putt, Shares Lead\n\nRickie Fowler rolls in a 25-footer on the par-5 eighth and joins his playing partner Matt Kuchar, and many, many others, in the lead at 3-under. Kuchar\u2019s own birdie putt, which would give him the solo lead at 4-under, is missed by less than an inch. Kuchar had been on the green in 2, so that\u2019s a bit of a disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBill Pennington: There\u2019s currently about an 85 percent chance of rain by 10 a.m. Saturday in Augusta, with the rain continuing until early evening. Are you ready for the prospect of a Masters Sunday that begins in the morning so dozens of golfers can play 27 to 36 holes?\n\nBernd Wiesberger Visits the Top of the Leaderboard\n\nHey, Bernd Wiesberger, join the leaders! The Austrian made a 7-foot birdie putt on the par-5 second hole to go to 3-under as well.\n\nBack and Forth, Back and Forth\n\nBogey-birdie-bogey-birdie. Rafael Cabrera Bello of Spain keeps joining the leaders, then falling back. He\u2019s back among them now after dropping his 175-yard second shot to within a foot of the pin on the fifth hole. He has three European PGA Tour wins, but none stateside.\n\nBill Pennington: There are a lot of good golfers \u2014 Stenson, Reed, Fleetwood, Watson and some guy named Woods \u2014 who will tee off in the afternoon. Temperatures are expected to warm up a few degrees to the high-70s. They may have the most favorable conditions today.\n\nThe Leaderboard Gets Even More Crowded\n\nA wild day on the leaderboard. The now six-man group tied for the lead at 3-under is followed by a nine-way tie at 2-under including McIlroy, Mickelson, Fowler, Tony Finau, Cabrera Bello, Bernd Weisberger, Louis Oosthuizen, and two who haven\u2019t started, Zach Johnson and Marc Leishman.\n\nBill Pennington: While most of the attention has been on McIlroy, Mickelson and Spieth, Dustin Johnson has three pars and an eagle on the par-5 second hole. He\u2019s at 1-under for the tournament. Let\u2019s not forget that Johnson was the runaway Masters favorite last year until he slipped on a stairway at his Augusta rental home.\n\nPhoto\n\nMcIlroy Slips Back to 2nd Place With a Bogey\n\nAnd Rory McIlroy\u2019s mercurial round continues with another bogey on No. 6. He missed the green on the par 3 with his tee shot and could only chip to 20 feet, where he missed the putt.\n\nCabrera Bello Runs Into Trouble\n\nRafael Cabrera Bello\u2019s time among the leaders was brief. A tee shot in the bunker led to a bogey on 4. Seven at the top again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRickie Fowler Drains 65-Footer for Par\n\nHe\u2019s not part of the leading eight, but Rickie Fowler sank a 65-foot putt to save par on the par-3 sixth after blowing his second shot from the trees way past the hole. That kept him at 2-under, a stroke back.\n\nRafael Cabrera Bello Joins the Party\n\nA seven-way tie for the lead not enough for you? How about eight? Rafael Cabrera Bello puts a chip within a foot and makes the putt for birdie on No. 3. He\u2019s in there at 3-under as well.\n\n7 Players Tied for the Lead at -3\n\nMatt Kuchar landed in a greenside trap on 5. After four straight pars, he is once again threatening to go the wrong way. His sand shot goes to 8 feet, and he misses it. But he doesn\u2019t lose the lead; McIlroy also bogeyed, and there is a seven-way tie for the lead at 3-under.\n\nThe leaders: Kuchar, who is one over on the day; McIlroy, with two bogeys and two birdies but no pars today; Spieth, who is three over on the day; and four guys who haven\u2019t started: Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Charley Hoffman and Adam Hadwin.\n\nJordan Spieth Steadies the Ship\n\nJordan Speith has a 10-footer to gain back a stroke, but it grazes the lip. Still, the par on 3 is better than he has been doing and he stays at -3.\n\nJordan Spieth Suddenly Two Strokes Back\n\nJordan Spieth\u2019s nightmare start continues. After a second wayward tee shot, he three-putts No.2 for another bogey and falls out of the lead. McIlroy and Kuchar are now tied at the top.\n\nRory McIlroy Makes a Run at the Lead\n\nAnd it\u2019s all happening right now! Birdies on 2 and 3 bring Rory McIlroy up to 4-under. The birdie on No. 3 came courtesy of a big drive, a chip second shot on the par-4 hole, and a short putt. He\u2019s tied with Matt Kuchar on top.\n\nMatt Kuchar Gets Some Relief\n\nCo-leader Matt Kuchar dumps the ball into the crowd behind the green on the par-3 fourth and could be in trouble. He has to pick up because the ball is behind the grandstand and drops it without penalty. He\u2019s still far off the green, but his second shot is beautiful, leaving him with a 3-foot par saver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPhil Mickelson Just One Stroke Back\n\nPhil Mickelson is the only player among the contenders who is under par for the day. He\u2019s looking at a birdie putt on No. 3 that could tie him for the lead. He misses that 10-footer, but is still in strong position a stroke back.\n\nChina\u2019s Li Haotong Falls Out of Contention\n\nLi Haotong, who was among the leaders yesterday, has had nothing but trouble today. The 22-year old from China double-bogeys the seventh hole to fall out of contention into the green numbers. Li\u2019s double came in part because of a terrible bunker shot that wound up on the 17th hole, not a good place to be when playing No. 7. He\u2019s gone from -3 to +1.\n\nSpieth Double-Bogeys First Hole\n\nThe tournament leader, Jordan Spieth, tees off, playing with Alex Noren and Louis Oosthuizen. And it\u2019s an unfortunate start as his tee shot goes well right. His second shot doesn\u2019t get much farther and his third does not reach the green. The end result is a double bogey. Yikes! A nightmare start for Spieth, now tied for the lead with Matt Kuchar. Rory McIlroy also started with a bogey, but Phil Mickelson birdied the second and is just a stroke back.\n\nKuchar, Mickelson and Fowler Struggle on No. 1\n\nThough Matt Kuchar was in second place and Rickie Fowler was 2-under, you get the sense that many in the big crowd for the latest group are there to see Phil Mickelson, also at -2 and playing some strong golf recently. Hole No. 1 doesn\u2019t go smoothly for any of the three. Kuchar and Mickelson miss the fairway, and Fowler misses the green with his second shot. Kuchar and Mickelson save their pars, but Fowler misses a 10-footer and slips to 1-under. The course is playing tough across-the-board so far.\n\nPhoto\n\nSlow Start, but Big Names Coming Up\n\nNo one\u2019s really making a move so far this morning. Li Haotong just dropped a stroke on No. 4, Tony Finau bogeyed the first, and none of the other players under par who have started have gained any ground.

The marketers turn to finance companies to provide high-interest loans to the clients that have to be repaid only if the clients receive money from the case. Those loans are then used to pay for surgery performed by doctors who are often lined up by the marketers.\n\nInterviews with dozens of women, lawyers, finance executives and marketers, as well as a review of court records and confidential documents, indicate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women have been sucked into this assembly-line-like system. It is fueled by banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, which provide financial backing.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe profits are immense. So are the costs to women. Some suffer physical problems from the surgery. Others say they have become depressed or unable to work. Still others have to get mesh reinserted.\n\nMs. Plummer\u2019s brush with the industry left her wearing diapers.\n\nFaulty Products\n\nThe industry of providing financing to law firms involved in litigation is not new. In recent years, it has expanded into a diverse array of businesses. A spate of companies, such as a Brooklyn outfit named Law Cash, have popped up to provide upfront cash to plaintiffs hoping for big legal settlements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe litigation surrounding mesh implants is a lucrative niche. These so-called mass tort cases, some of which began six years ago when problems with the implants started to arise, encompass claims brought by tens of thousands of women who say they were harmed by the same products.\n\nMillions of women worldwide received mesh implants. They are used to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman\u2019s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall.\n\nBut many women complained that the implants caused problems such as bleeding and discomfort during sex.\n\nLitigation against the implants\u2019 manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, proliferated. There are more than 100,000 plaintiffs in federal court alone. Many more are involved in litigation at the state level or outside the United States.\n\nRepresentatives of Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson said they stood by the quality of their products. The mesh manufacturers have set aside more than $3 billion to cover potential mesh-related settlements.\n\nNot all plaintiffs are equal. Some law firms \u2014 which are paid a percentage of any settlements \u2014 realized that women with the implants still in their bodies tended to receive smaller settlements than those who had them taken out.\n\n\u201cDefendants have offered next to nothing to settle cases involving mesh products that have not been removed,\u201d Ms. Plummer\u2019s lawyers at McSweeney Langevin, a small Minneapolis personal injury firm, wrote in a letter advising her to get the implant taken out.\n\nRhett McSweeney, a co-founder of the law firm, said in a statement that the firm never forced clients to undergo unnecessary surgery and \u201cnever directed a client to a particular doctor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 firms turned to marketers to recruit clients. Women with mesh implants said they soon started receiving torrents of unsolicited phone calls, some originating overseas. The women said they didn\u2019t know how these marketers had found them and seemed to know their medical histories.\n\n\u201cI think my privacy was breached,\u201d said Jennifer Godsoe, 66, who lives in Cumberland, Me. \u201cThe more I think about it, the more upset I get.\u201d\n\nSome women had vague memories of answering an online ad about mesh problems. The only thing linking some other women was that they previously had the same doctors, court records show.\n\nWomen who took the marketing bait were connected to doctors willing to perform the mesh-removal surgery \u2014 although that process remains murky. One critical player was Surgical Assistance, a Florida company led by Wesley Blake Barber, which acted as a middleman between the women, doctors and funding companies. Mr. Barber\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.\n\nIn a deposition last summer, Mr. Barber outlined how the company had lined up doctors in Florida and Georgia to perform the surgery. In one online ad, an actor in a white lab coat assures women suffering from their mesh implants that relief is near. By calling a toll-free number, the women will be set up with a \u201cnetwork of qualified surgeons\u201d who remove the mesh without requiring upfront payments.\n\nWomen who opted for surgery were flown to Florida and Georgia, put up in motels and sent to walk-in clinics, court filings show. The women generally didn\u2019t meet the doctors who would be operating on them until shortly before the procedure. Before going under the knife, few women got a second opinion.\n\nDan Christensen, a lawyer who ran MedStar Funding, which financed mesh removal surgery, said in an interview that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to argue that women had undergone unnecessary surgery.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a doctor willing to put his license on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy jeopardize your license?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n$14,000 a Day\n\nThe work was lucrative. Doctors stood to make $14,000 a day.\n\nDoctors sometimes churned through four or five removals in a day. Each procedure typically cost about $21,000, according to lawsuits brought by women against the mesh manufacturers. Of that, doctors pocketed roughly $3,500 per surgery; most of the rest went to the medical centers where the surgery took place.\n\nLaw Cash offered Danette Charnetzky, a hospice worker in Waynesburg, Ohio, financing for a removal surgery in December 2014. Ms. Charnetzky, another McSweeney client, agreed to pay the money back, at a double-digit interest rate, if the litigation was successful. Within a week, she and her husband were on a plane to a surgical center in a Florida strip mall. The process was a terrifying blur.\n\n\u201cI wish I could have changed my mind, but we were already there,\u201d said Ms. Charnetzky, 49, who hasn\u2019t received any money from the pending litigation against the mesh manufacturer. \u201cI just prayed for the best.\u201d\n\nShe got the worst \u2014 or something close to it. Ms. Charnetzky said she had needed two more procedures to repair scar tissue left by the Florida surgery.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since her mesh implant was removed in January 2015, she has developed incontinence. \u201cI may need another surgery,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bladder problems have left Ms. Espeland unable to work, and she hasn\u2019t received any money from litigation against her mesh manufacturer. Boxes of diapers are regularly delivered to her door.\n\nThe doctor who performed her surgery \u2014 and similar procedures on hundreds of others \u2014 was Earle M. Pescatore. In March 2014, around the time that he started doing lots of procedures, Mr. Pescatore and his wife filed for bankruptcy, citing liabilities of $1.5 million, including $38,000 they owed to the Internal Revenue Service, according to court filings. Dr. Pescatore said in a deposition that he had little memory of women he operated on.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAny treatment that Dr. Pescatore provided would have been medically necessary,\u201d his lawyer, Mark DiCowden, said.\n\nWhile studies have shown that up to 15 percent of women with mesh implants will encounter problems, removing the mesh is not always recommended. Taking it out is more complicated than inserting it because the mesh is made of fiber that is designed to bond with tissue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of the women who got the surgery had limited or no health insurance. They rarely discussed the surgery with their primary care physicians before arriving at the clinics. Some said they had felt rushed into getting surgery.\n\nDr. Victor Nitti, a surgeon specializing in complex pelvic issues at NYU Langone Health in New York, said serious mesh problems should be addressed with surgery. But, he said, \u201cscaring a patient who has limited to no symptoms into removal is just dangerous and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nDr. Nitti said he had grown concerned about such scare tactics after some patients told him that they had been contacted by marketers.\n\nFunding Machine\n\nA handful of specialized finance firms funded the surgery that Ms. Plummer, Ms. Espeland and other women got. Court filings show that the two main players are Law Cash and Banyan Finance of Boca Raton, Fla., and that the firms charge double-digit interest rates.\n\nRoss Elgart, Banyan\u2019s chief executive, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLew Fidler, Law Cash\u2019s general counsel, said financing surgical procedures such as Ms. Plummer\u2019s is a small portion of the company\u2019s business. He said the firm, which typically provides cash advances to help plaintiffs pay for everyday expenses, ensures that each surgery is necessary.\n\n\u201cI feel for anyone who didn\u2019t get the outcome they were looking for, but we are not doctors,\u201d Mr. Fidler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t substitute our judgment for a licensed physician.\u201d\n\nLaw Cash, like other firms, is paid back for a surgical advance only if the person gets a settlement. The firms contend that high interest rates cover the risk that some borrowers will never collect settlements. Some women, however, said the high interest rates had never fully been explained to them.\n\nAs a result of those steep interest rates, plaintiffs who do collect settlements see much of the money go to the financing firms. Another large slice goes to their lawyers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMedical funding for personal injury litigants was a topic of discussion Friday in Las Vegas at the mass tort industry\u2019s big annual conference, titled \u201cMass Torts Made Perfect.\u201d Law firms are eyeing mesh used to treat hernias as the next gold mine.\n\nThe industry has grown thanks in part to a gusher of money from mainstream financial institutions. Law Cash gets funding from DZ Bank, Germany\u2019s second-largest bank, and Melody Capital Partners, a hedge fund with $1.8 billion in assets.\n\nMcSweeney Langevin, which has represented more than 1,000 women in mesh litigation, got backing from EJF Capital, a Virginia hedge fund with $10 billion in assets, according to corporate records.\n\nMany of McSweeney\u2019s clients initially were signed up by a now-defunct law and marketing firm, Alpha Law. The Washington firm had signed up 14,000 women for the mesh litigation. Its unusual role in the litigation was the subject of a series of Reuters articles.\n\nThe industry tries to keep the network of marketers and financiers out of sight \u2014 and some participants have refused to answer questions in depositions, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\n\u201cPeople are claiming the Fifth and so on and so forth,\u201d said Magistrate Judge Cheryl Eifert in West Virginia, who is hearing one of the mesh cases in federal court. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to talk about necessarily how much money they make, per se, but if someone would just give them an idea of how the arrangement works. But nobody\u2019s willing to do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Barber of Surgical Assistance, for example, asserted the privilege nearly two dozen times in a deposition.\n\nSwollen Like Balloons\n\nJerri Plummer never figured out whom Yolanda worked for. But in December 2014, Dr. Whitney Shoemaker performed the implant-removal surgery. Until the day of the operation, Ms. Plummer had never spoken to Dr. Shoemaker. Her lawyer declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHours after Ms. Plummer went under the scalpel, she said, she was hustled back to a Hampton Inn just off the freeway, with a catheter sticking out of her side. The next day, a nurse arrived at the motel, removed the catheter and put her in a taxi to the airport.\n\nSoon after she arrived home in Arkansas, she said, complications developed. Her legs swelled like balloons. Her stomach seized up. Ms. Plummer went to her original doctor for help, she said. He informed her that the damage was irreversible. Worse, she said in court records, he told her that there had been no need for the removal surgery.\n\nBefore the surgery, Ms. Plummer loved to take walks with her two pit bulls and to eat with her husband at Red Lobster. Now chronic incontinence forces her to wear diapers all day and has left her too worried about wetting herself to venture outside.\n\nWith the help of a local lawyer, James R. Baxter, she is suing Law Cash; Dr. Shoemaker; Mr. Barber and his firm, Surgical Assistance; and lawyers at the McSweeney firm.\n\nMr. McSweeney declined to comment on the lawsuit. His firm is trying to get Ms. Plummer\u2019s lawsuit moved from federal court into private arbitration, where there is no judge or jury. In his statement, he said the firm \u201chad no role\u201d connecting clients with surgical funders like Law Cash or Banyan Finance.\n\nThe law firm now has clients sign a waiver that advises them that cash advances to pay for surgery \u201care terrible loans with extremely high interest rates.\u201d\n\nMs. Plummer said she had never received such a warning.

Even in wave election years, incumbents generally win re-election in districts that tilt somewhat toward their party. Most Republican incumbents represent such districts, in part because of partisan gerrymandering and the tendency for Democrats to cluster in urban districts and \u201cwaste\u201d votes.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story without the advantage of incumbency. In a wave year, the president\u2019s party struggles to retain open seats in competitive districts, even those that tilt toward their party. Often, a retirement is the difference in whether a race is competitive at all.\n\nHere\u2019s a rule of thumb: A Republican retirement in competitive districts costs the party about one-third of a seat, on average, in this political environment. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Ross were the 18th and 19th such retirements for the Republicans. Collectively, it suggests the retirements will cost the Republicans the equivalent of around six seats. (Of course, there are always such retirements, but the pace of them in this cycle is well above the norm.) That is one-fourth of the seats the Democrats need to retake the House.\n\nIt makes it increasingly difficult for the Republicans to prevail in a wave election.\n\nOne way to think about it is in terms of the national popular vote: What margin of victory would Democrats need to take the House? In 2014 and 2016, the Republican structural advantage was so large that the Democrats might have needed an eight-plus-point victory \u2014 even larger than the Republican margin in 2010 and 1994, and about as large as the Democratic margin in 2006. So it seemed that the Republicans had a plausible and even a good chance to survive a wave in 2018.\n\nBut today, Democrats would be favored to win with less than a seven-point popular vote margin.

{"date": "2018-04-13 00:00:00", "text": "A series of nasty thoughts that had begun as whispers in the back of my head mounted into angry shouts over time. I had moments of happiness and joy over the eight or nine months those dark thoughts haunted me, but as soon as the positive thoughts faded I reverted back into the darkness that had become my default mental setting.\n\nIt built gradually, but those dark thoughts vanished in an instant somewhere high above the beaches of Dubai. And I haven\u2019t heard so much as a faint whisper from them since the moment I stepped out of the airplane.\n\nWhen I got home I began doing some research, and was surprised to find that I\u2019m far from alone. In fact, researchers around the world are currently studying the effectiveness of adventure sports in combating anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 and for the author and counselor Brandon Stogsdill, as a way to help at-risk youths from underprivileged communities overcome childhood trauma.\n\n\u201cIn behavioral therapy we talk about that thought process you had as an automatic negative dialogue, which pops in without any effort, and your brain will create literal neural pathways to make that stronger and stronger until we do something to take ourselves out of it,\u201d he explained over the phone from his office in Seattle.\n\nAccording to Mr. Stogsdill, depression makes it hard for one to concentrate on the present moment. Instead the depressed brain is constantly dreaming up negative future scenarios or dwelling on traumatic past events. \u201cThe healthy thing is to focus on the moment, because we have more control in the moment, and when you\u2019re sky diving you can only focus on right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are a variety of depression types and levels of severity, he added, and while some may need only high-adrenaline activity to jolt their brains back to a non-depressed state, it is by no means a universal cure.\n\nFor sufferers of less extreme depression, however, action sports like sky diving are very effective ways to rewire the brain\u2019s focus back into the present moment. Of course, it\u2019s not the only method. Mr. Stogsdill often counsels underprivileged youth on the ski hill, and found painting an effective tactic for focusing his thoughts on the present moment and combating depression after a BMX accident rendered him temporarily immobile.\n\nWhen I signed the intimidatingly long waiver at the flight school in Dubai, I had no idea that I would land back on earth feeling like a completely new person, or at least back to the person I was before my battle with depression began. While the initial adrenaline rush does provide some immediate relief, the dive had a much longer-lasting impact on my general outlook. It allowed me to think clearly for what felt like the first time in months, and reaffirmed something I had once known about myself, but had forgotten somewhere along the way.", "title": "Opinion | How Sky Diving Cured My Depression", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "With those findings as a backdrop, other scientists began to look at the working of the immune systems of athletes during and after draining events. Their research showed that changes occurred, some of them drastic. During an event such as a marathon, for instance, immune cells would begin to flood the bloodstreams of the athletes, apparently flushed there from other parts of the body as heart rates rose and blood sluiced more forcefully through various tissues.\n\nBy the time the race ended, the runners\u2019 bloodstreams would teem with extra immune cells.\n\nBut within a few hours, the numbers of many such immune cells in the bloodstream would crash, researchers found, typically falling to levels far lower than before the event.\n\nThe scientists interpreted these findings to mean that the runners\u2019 physical exertions had killed large numbers of their immune cells and created what some researchers dubbed an \u201copen window\u201d of immune suppression that could allow opportunistic germs to creep in, unopposed.\n\nThat idea became established doctrine in exercise science and sports.\n\nBut recently, health researchers at the University of Bath in England grew skeptical. From an evolutionary standpoint, they reasoned, immune suppression after strenuous exercise made little sense. Early humans often had to chase prey or flee predators, opening themselves to injury. If they experienced a weakened immune response at the same time, they were in serious jeopardy.\n\nThe researchers also suspected that scientific techniques developed since the 1980s might offer updated insights into what was going on inside the bodies of tired athletes.\n\nSo for the new review, which was published this month in Frontiers in Immunology, they gathered and analyzed a wide variety of recent studies and used those findings to reconsider what exercise does to immunity in the short term.\n\nTheir first conclusion was that athletes are lousy at identifying whether and why they are sniffling. The original 1980s studies had relied on runners\u2019 self-reports of illness. But newer experiments that actually tested saliva showed that less than a third of marathon runners who thought they had caught a cold actually had. Statistically, their odds of becoming sick were about the same as for anyone else in the race\u2019s host city.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When the mice subsequently ran, many of the cells moved out of various tissues and into the bloodstream, as happens in people.\n\nBut after exercise, these cells did not die off in massive numbers. Instead, the tracking revealed, they moved elsewhere, migrating to the animals\u2019 guts or lungs, portions of the body that might be expected to need extra immune help after hard exercise. A few immune cells also flowed into the bone marrow, where they were thought to spark specialized stem cells into creating additional immune cells.\n\nIn essence, the rodents\u2019 immune systems had bolstered their defenses in vulnerable areas of the body after exercise by redirecting cells from the blood.\n\nWhether the same migrations take place inside of us is still unknown.\n\n\u201cLive tracking of immune cells after exercise has not been done in people,\u201d says James Turner, the review\u2019s co-author and also a professor at the University of Bath.\n\nBut he and Dr. Campbell suspect that this scenario would explain how immune-cell levels in marathoners\u2019 blood rise back to normal within about 24 hours after a race.\n\n\u201cThe body can\u2019t replace cells that quickly,\u201d Dr. Turner says. So they must be returning to the blood from elsewhere.\n\nHe and Dr. Campbell hope that future experiments will follow human athletes\u2019 peripatetic immune cells after exercise and track how they influence health.\n\nBut for now, the researchers would like their review to help to recalibrate our ideas about strenuous exercise and illness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPeople should not be put off exercising for fear of it suppressing their immune system,\u201d Dr. Campbell says. \u201cExercise is good for the immune system.\u201d", "title": "How Strenuous Exercise Affects Our Immune System", "authors": ["Gretchen Reynolds", "Phys Ed"]}

They are, however, of great use to foreigners who want to invest within the United States. And that\u2019s what happens with the dollars that aren\u2019t spent on American exports.\n\nForeign investment is key to our economic growth here at home. In other words, we Americans win when we get to buy the stuff we want from abroad and when those dollars are pumped back into our economy.\n\nThis benefit remains intact despite Beijing\u2019s many violations of our trade rules \u2014 such as its subsidization of Chinese steel makers. It\u2019s true that those subsidies artificially lower the price of steel imported by America and might hurt some American steel mills and workers. But this effect is the same as it would be if Chinese steel makers had a genuine efficiency advantage over our producers. Despite the administration\u2019s constant refrain about the devastating impact of foreign export subsidies on the steel industry, experts know that a vastly greater number of steel jobs were lost to innovation, not trade.\n\nEven in the subsidization scenario, we pay for Chinese steel with dollars, and the Chinese then use some of those dollars to buy our exports and use the rest to invest in our country. In both cases, it creates jobs here. The same relationship holds when the Chinese manipulate their currency to stimulate their exports.\n\nSome worry that the Chinese won\u2019t spend their dollars in the United States, but this concern is misplaced. If there were no foreigners who wanted to spend or invest dollars in America, the Chinese would not have exported steel to the United States to begin with. At the end of the day, dollars have value only because they can ultimately be used to buy American-made outputs or be invested in American assets.\n\nIf the Chinese spend their dollars in Japan, the Japanese will turn around and spend their dollars in America, by investing in such things as a brand-new Toyota plant that will employ United States workers. Dollars will always find their way home.\n\nAnother way these dollars make their way back home is through foreign investors who buy Uncle Sam\u2019s debt. As of January 2018, for instance, China has returned $1.17 trillion this way.

It has achieved what no country has since China developed its own program a half-century ago: a nuclear deterrent against the United States.\n\nTo stall or reverse those gains, Mr. Trump has issued threats and imposed sanctions on North Korea, but for the most part his responses have not been that different from those of previous administrations. His major break with diplomatic orthodoxy was to agree to a direct meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. The North has long sought such a meeting as a way to portray itself as a peer of the great powers.\n\nAmong Korea experts, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach has won the greatest support from left-leaning doves.\n\nIran, meanwhile, has kept its nuclear program frozen and continues to accept international inspections, according to the international watchdogs and American intelligence officials who have repeatedly said that the country is complying with its obligations under the nuclear deal signed in 2015.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened Iran and pledged to withdraw from the agreement or impose sanctions that would abrogate American commitments. He has won cheers from hawks on Iran who oppose the deal.\n\nHow to square these inconsistencies? Within the United States, the most common explanations draw on Mr. Trump\u2019s personality or on domestic politics. Perhaps he opposes the Iran deal because he was not the one to close it, for instance, but he can support a North Korea deal that would bear his signature.\n\nBut foreign states do not have the luxury of shrugging off the American president\u2019s thinking as an inscrutable mystery. They must stitch together a narrative with which to predict future behavior.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe clearest narrative may be that the Americans cannot necessarily be trusted to uphold their commitments \u2014 Mr. Trump has broken or withdrawn from several other international agreements \u2014 but they can be, as Mr. Kim showed, coerced and deterred.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe nuclear lessons may be starker.\n\nDismantle or freeze your program on assurances from the United States, and those assurances may be broken. Accelerate your program in open defiance of international agreements, and the American president will offer to meet with you.\n\nThe Costs of Unpredictability\n\nMr. Trump said on the campaign trail that his businesses had succeeded in part because, in negotiations, he had relied on bluffing, threats to walk out and ruthless, zero-sum transactionalism.\n\nHe had sometimes refused to fully pay contractors, including those working for his campaign. He sued Deutsche Bank in 2008 to escape $40 million in personal loan guarantees. Confronted with a copy of a tax return suggesting that he had not paid federal income tax in some years, Mr. Trump retorted, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d\n\nHe has he said would apply his approach in business to foreign relations, pledging to extract maximum concessions even from allies. Unpredictability and threats would keep other leaders guessing, forcing them to deliver concessions, he said.\n\nMr. Trump would not have to look long for countries that have deployed this strategy: Iran and North Korea have pursued more extreme versions for years.\n\nStill, this approach comes with costs. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week of the nuclear agreement with Iran that \u201cit is written almost with an assumption that Iran would try to cheat.\u201d\n\nThe deal, though signed by several world powers, including China and Russia, hands considerable discretion to Washington over when and how to punish any Iranian cheating.

Bush, who convened six-nation talks over North Korea\u2019s nuclear arms program.\n\nThe idea was that the United States would forge a consensus among allies and great powers, then use that consensus as the starting point of talks with whatever rogue state was troubling it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis put the United States at the center of the process, ensuring that it would always have a say. If France or Russia wanted some concession or course correction, it had to go through the Americans to get it.\n\nThis state of affairs has required Washington to make frequent compromises to retain the support of other powers for a system anchored to Washington. The United States had to be the rational referee in negotiations, letting other countries issue demands or threaten to walk out.\n\nIncreasingly, the United States is the one issuing demands and threatening to blow up negotiations if they do not satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s terms.\n\nThis approach does win concessions. European leaders are offering new constraints on Iran.\n\nBut it also gives allies and adversaries incentives to go around the Americans, rather than put them at the center of everything.\n\nSome analysts expect that if Mr. Trump walks away from the Iran deal, the Europeans and Iranians will find some accommodation that excludes him. Washington would lose its leverage over how Iran is held to account.\n\nThis week\u2019s inter-Korean summit meeting also hints at declining American influence over negotiations.\n\nThe Trump administration has demanded that North Korea \u201cdenuclearize\u201d in the sense that the country would immediately and unilaterally surrender its nuclear program. But this week the two Koreas pledged eventual denuclearization of the entire peninsula. Both North and South Korea seem to have ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump shows signs of enjoying his power as international spoiler.\n\nHours before the inter-Korean agreement was released, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw American support from any country that \u201cwere to lobby against\u201d his bid for the 2026 soccer World Cup tournament.\n\n\u201cWhy should we be supporting these countries when they don\u2019t support us,\u201d he asked.", "title": "How Trump\u2019s Mixed Signals Complicate America\u2019s Role in the World", "authors": ["Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}

I got dirt from various parts of the state, including my hometown, Galveston. A friend also sent some \u2014 he said he chipped a piece off the Alamo, too, but I don\u2019t believe him. The resulting mixture fit into a baggie.\n\nWhen I asked the doctor about bringing it into the hospital, she was, luckily enough, charmed. She\u2019s Italian. She said it would be fine so long as it was in a sterile container and under the delivery table.\n\nUnfortunately, that baby, Elizabeth, was born without the benefit of the dirt, because she was delivered in an emergency procedure and I was stuck in traffic trying to get to the hospital. The dirt was the least of our worries. (She\u2019s fine. She\u2019s 30 now, with a daughter of her own. Who was born in Texas!)\n\nBeing born over a baggie confers no official status, of course. But I was able to get a friendly member of the Texas State Senate to pass a resolution that mentioned the dirt and declared Elizabeth \u201ca child of the Lone Star State.\u201d (The resolution did not, alas, declare her eligible for in-state tuition.)\n\nI held on to the bag, which was present for the births of our second and third children, born in 1990 and 1996, in New York and Maryland; they got resolutions, too.

And when they do this, their behavior and their anatomy change, and they become what we call social parasites. These are intruder organisms that are able to bypass or kind of hijack ant nest mate recognition systems and integrate socially into the organization of ant colonies and they do this to termites as well.\n\nQ.

Voters expected that living standards would soon match those in Western Europe \u2014 especially as many former communist countries moved to join the European Union.\n\nPersonal freedoms and wealth did increase, but the chaotic nature of the process, compounded by the global financial crisis in 2008, meant that expectations often outpaced progress. In some countries, the privatization of state assets was perceived as benefiting foreign investors and corrupt politicians more often than it did ordinary citizens.\n\nPhoto\n\nPoliticians sensed the mood, and shifted rightward. The current Czech president, Milos Zeman, was a liberal-minded dissident in the dying years of communism but now courts the far right. His prime minister, Andrej Babis, was never a freedom fighter but was elected last year on a populist platform attacking the perceived failings of the post-1989 political elite.\n\nIn Poland, the leader of the governing party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is a conservative who was once ostracized by the early leaders of post-communist Poland. But his nativist, autocratic ideas have gained currency as resentment over aspects of the transition set in when voters\u2019 aspirations exceeded the pace of social and economic change.\n\n\u201cKaczynski is a master of playing on bad emotions,\u201d said Radoslaw Sikorski, who was foreign minister and speaker of the Polish Parliament during the government that preceded Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s.\n\nBut no one exemplifies the angry direction of post-communist Eastern Europe more than Viktor Orban, whose journey from liberal academic to illiberal populist is starker than any of his regional contemporaries. He used the Soros grant to study the history of civil society at Oxford University, fought communism as a dissident from behind the Iron Curtain and then, as a center-right politician, helped to steer Hungary into the European Union and NATO.\n\nNow Mr. Orban is a populist hero to Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former strategist, and the self-declared leader of a \u201ccultural counterrevolution\u201d that is dividing the European bloc he once fought to join.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe worst nightmare, in terms of Orban-ism spreading, has come true,\u201d said Gerald Knaus, the director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based research group.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe young Mr. Orban was a passionate dissident, famous for a 1988 speech in which he demanded that Soviet troops leave Hungarian soil. At another rally, Mr. Orban risked his life to protect another opposition leader, Gaspar Miklos Tamas, taking several blows to his head as he thrust himself between the police and Mr. Tamas.\n\nHe gave little hint of his future trajectory \u2014 save a cameo role in a student production of the German Absurdist drama \u201cHow Mr. Mockinpott Was Cured of His Sufferings\u201d, in which he played a demagogue.\n\n\u201cIt was not his aim to be a politician,\u201d said Gabor Fodor, Mr. Orban\u2019s former roommate and best friend. \u201cHe wanted to be an intellectual and to be a member of Hungarian intellectual circles.\u201d\n\nThat all began to shift in 1990, with the approach of Hungary\u2019s first democratic elections in half a century. Mr. Orban had co-founded a liberal youth group, Fidesz, that was reconstituted as a political party and won 22 seats in the new Parliament.\n\nAppointed as the party\u2019s leader, Mr. Orban spoke out against nationalism, defended civil society and opposed clerical influence in politics. But behind the scenes, his political ideology was beginning to morph \u2014 and he was beginning to exert greater control on the management of Fidesz.\n\nBy 1993, Mr. Orban had assumed overall leadership of Fidesz, redefined it as a more nationalist and centrist party and ruthlessly sidelined its liberal faction, headed by his now former friend, Gabor Fodor.\n\nQuite why Mr. Orban changed is a matter of debate. Some contemporaries believe it was the genuine ideological shift of a young man whose politics were a work in progress.

Overshadowed by other left-of-center parties, Fidesz lacked a clear brand. By tacking toward the political center, Mr. Orban reckoned that his party could stand out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike most other Hungarian politicians of the time, Mr. Orban \u201cthought about politics in a more professional way,\u201d said Zsuzsanna Szelenyi, one of the Fidesz lawmakers sidelined by Mr. Orban in 1993. \u201cHe realized it was about power.\u201d\n\nDespite Mr. Orban\u2019s machinations, Fidesz did poorly in the 1994 elections. He responded by shifting further to the right, turning Fidesz into a center-right Christian democratic party \u2014 one still open to Western and American ideals.\n\n\u201cThe 1990s were wonderful for American diplomats,\u201d said Donald Blinken, who, as the American ambassador to Hungary from 1994 to 1997, lunched annually with Mr. Orban. \u201cEveryone loved us, the Cold War was won, and we thought it was this great period of peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Orban kept growing more nationalistic \u2014 and, apparently, more religious.\n\nMarried in a civil wedding a decade earlier, Mr. Orban and his wife, Aniko Levai, renewed their vows in a religious ceremony in 1996. Gabor Ivanyi, the pastor who performed that second ceremony, has since become skeptical of Mr. Orban\u2019s motivations. \u201cHe had to convince people, to win over the conservative right,\u201d Mr. Ivanyi said. \u201cHe is an unscrupulous person.\u201d\n\nMr. Orban finally assumed power in 1998, becoming prime minister for the first time at the head of a conservative coalition. (Voters were angered by the Socialist-led government\u2019s handling of the struggling economy.)\n\nFor the next four years, Mr. Orban operated as a relatively orthodox center-right politician. His administration was tainted by minor corruption scandals, but his performance was mostly praised.\n\nHe brought Hungary to the brink of European Union membership and shepherded the country into NATO, an event he celebrated with a private dinner in Brussels attended by several of his mentors, including Zbigniew Pelczynski, his politics professor at Oxford.\n\nIt was his defeat in the 2002 elections that accelerated his pivot to the far right.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey say that power spoils good politicians,\u201d said Jozsef Debreczeni, an adviser to Mr. Orban after his first rightward turn \u2014 and later his biographer. \u201cWith Orban that wasn\u2019t the case. It was the loss of power that did that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring an intense one-and-a-half days after the election, Mr. Debreczeni listened as Mr. Orban blamed his political demise on a partisan news media that needed to be reined in.\n\nMr. Debreczeni said that Mr. Orban had drawn one conclusion: \u201cThis democracy thing, where power can slip so quickly from you, was no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from that point on,\u201d Mr. Debreczeni added, \u201che spent his time preparing so that if he ever won power again, he wouldn\u2019t lose it.\u201d\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008, coupled with increasing resentment of the Socialist-led government, eventually gave Mr. Orban that chance. The Socialists, who were also in power during the economic turmoil of the 1990s, were accused of squandering the political and economic potential of the transition from communism.\n\nMr. Orban reinvented himself as an outsider who promised to restore Hungarian control to an economy buffeted by external forces \u2014 a popular policy among Hungarians rankled by how privatization efforts after 1989 had allowed foreigners to take over parts of Hungarian industry.\n\n\u201cTo understand the Orban phenomenon, you have to go back to 1989,\u201d said Laszlo Andor, who was once Hungary\u2019s most senior representative at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. \u201cPeople\u2019s ambitions were not fulfilled.\u201d\n\nElected by a landslide in 2010, Mr. Orban has steadily weakened Hungary\u2019s democratic institutions while invoking the self-contradictory concept of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d and hailing the autocratic governments of Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\n\nTo outflank a major far-right opposition party, Jobbik, he tacked further to the right on immigration. By 2015, Mr. Orban had cajoled several Central and East European countries to block the European Union\u2019s efforts to resettle thousands of migrants fleeing violence elsewhere \u2014 and provided a template for a democratic backslide in Poland.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis influence then crept further west. He forged an alliance with Horst Seehofer, the new German interior minister; appeared with Geert Wilders, the Dutch nationalist politician; and became a frequent subject of praise during recent election campaigns in Austria that ended with a far-right party joining a coalition government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Orban sees all this as nothing less than the march of history.\n\n\u201cWhat we are experiencing now is the end of an era: a conceptual-ideological era,\u201d he said in a major speech in 2015, as he began to expand his international profile. \u201cPutting pretension aside, we can simply call this the era of liberal babble.\u201d", "title": "How a Liberal Dissident Became a Far-Right Hero, in Hungary and Beyond", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley"]}

How exactly this plays out will have tremendous implications for society.\n\nThe battle between Detroit and Silicon Valley over the future of cars is epic. Billions of dollars will be won or lost, and the outcome will have big implications for work, especially in the Midwestern states where the traditional automakers still have most of their operations. Cars have already essentially become computers on wheels, and that will only continue as more autonomous features are added.\n\nBut I believe that electric cars will become far more widespread before fully autonomous driving. We recently bought a Chevy Volt and have been very impressed with the torque of the electric motor and the battery\u2019s 45-mile range before the gas engine takes over. I used to cover the auto industry in Detroit, and I think it\u2019s important to try out new things.\n\nI\u2019m also a firm believer that the spread of technology \u2014 what some call the fourth industrial revolution \u2014 will give opportunities to millions of people around the globe. We need to stop thinking of Silicon Valley and New York as the centers of the world; there are now many others. China, in particular, has emerged as a hotbed of tech innovation. It has 700 million internet users and 50 times the number of people using mobile payments as the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou\u2019ve been building up The Times\u2019s conferences and live events. How important is tech to the success of these events?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe heart of a successful event is the quality of the interviews and the conversation. Live events are a way to bring journalism to life \u2014 I call it live journalism. While many people want to dive into a 4,000-word investigative story, even more could learn about the findings through a video of an interview with the reporter.\n\nWe increasingly tap Facebook Live and other social media to make our events more interactive and to include those not fortunate enough to be in the room.\n\nI\u2019m also struck by how important live events are. We have more information at our fingertips than ever before. Yet more than ever we also need events that help us meet that person we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have. This is a phenomena that has been well explained by my friend Priya Parker in her coming book, \u201cThe Art of Gathering.\u201d\n\nWhat tech products are your children currently obsessed with?\n\nI have three kids, and they teach me an enormous amount about the future of technology.\n\nThe two youngest, ages 14 and 17, are very into Snapchat.

Worth. So to provide readers with an original image of Mr. Mattis, the magazine needed to photograph the secretary during his limited public appearances, which happen about once a week when he briefly walks down the Pentagon steps to welcome visiting dignitaries.\n\nFor the assignment, the magazine enlisted the photographer Mark Peterson, a contributor to The Times for over 20 years, who is known for his skill at capturing candid shots that tell a full story. Mr. Peterson took the picture that would become Sunday\u2019s cover of The Times Magazine on his second trip to the Pentagon for this assignment, as Mr. Mattis met with the defense minister of Estonia in early March. Mr. Peterson recently explained how he got the shot.\n\nWhen did you get the call to work on this assignment?\n\nI would guess a month ago. The photo editor said that they didn\u2019t have any access, so they were hoping to make something from his public appearances, and his public appearances are basically walking down a 12- or 15-step entrance at the Pentagon and shaking hands with somebody getting out of the car, and then turning around and walking up the steps and standing there while their national anthems are being played. And then they go inside and sit down at a table for a formal meeting. You can usually photograph that for about a minute, while they say cordials to each other.\n\nHow difficult was it to get into the spot where you took the picture of Mr. Mattis?Any photography is a matter of luck. I hadn\u2019t shot at the Pentagon a lot. So, I asked the public affairs person what happens during the ceremony, and they gave me two options of where to shoot \u2014 either from straight on, which would basically be a shot of them with their hands on their hearts and the honor guard flanking them \u2014 a very formal picture. Or you could try from the side. I felt like the side you\u2019d have more opportunity to frame them differently.\n\nIt is just luck. It is not any skill on my part. You\u2019re just praying that they move into the area you\u2019re hoping, and that there\u2019s a gesture that then works at that moment. I was down low on my knees, I think, shooting through the honor guard, and in my mind, hoping he would turn to his right a little bit so you could see his face, and he did. He just looked that way for a frame, so that is what made the shot. If he had been looking the other way it wouldn\u2019t have worked. But it was just luck. You\u2019re just praying that what you think could happen, happened.\n\nHow long was the total time Mr. Mattis was standing there?\n\nTen minutes maybe, total.\n\nWhat do you look for in a shot?\n\nChaos, controlled chaos is usually what I like \u2014 where there\u2019s just a lot happening but it all fits into the frame. If there\u2019s enough chaotic nature or kinetic feeling or movement that is what I really like. I\u2019m trying to get as much information into one frame and still have it be something that you want to look at.\n\nHow do you use the medium of photography to tell that story?\n\nThe power of photography is it freezes the moment. What you\u2019re hoping with a still image is to create something that is frozen, so you look at it, but you can see the past and the future in that moment.", "title": "How a Photographer Got a Rare Shot of James Mattis", "authors": ["Katie Van Syckle"]}

He said he has yet to decide whether he will support Ms. Haspel\u2019s confirmation.\n\nThe openly political nature of the current director, Mike Pompeo, who is awaiting confirmation as secretary of state, frustrated some within the agency.

More than 100 retired generals and admirals plan to release a letter on Monday saying they believe she is unfit to lead the C.I.A. because of her role in the interrogation program and destroying the videos. The letter was organized by retired Gen. Charles C. Krulak, the former Marine Corps commandant.\n\n\u201cWe do not accept efforts to excuse her actions relating to torture and other unlawful abuse of detainees by offering that she was \u2018just following orders,\u2019 \u201d they wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe did not accept the \u2018just following orders\u2019 justification after World War II, and we should not accept it now,\u201d they added, referring to the defense used unsuccessfully by some Nazi leaders at the postwar Nuremberg trials.\n\nShortly after Mr. Trump said Ms. Haspel was his choice to be director, the spy agency kicked off its robust media campaign on Twitter. Attempting to round out her public biography, the C.I.A. said she was born in Ashland, Ky., the oldest of five children and that, at the agency, she had to put up with male colleagues who were unaccustomed to seeing a woman take charge in dangerous corners of the world.\n\nThe C.I.A. also made clear she was an experienced clandestine officer who had served in dangerous places, and helped battle communism in the waning days of the Cold War.\n\nThe agency said she joined its counterterrorism center on the day of the Sept. 11 attacks, but there was no mention of her role in Thailand, where a pair of psychologists working for the C.I.A. waterboarded at least two Qaeda suspects. One, Abu Zubaydah, was waterboarded 83 times before Ms. Haspel\u2019s arrival. Under her leadership, the other, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was waterboarded three times.\n\nAt the same time, the agency touted the careers of former female spies who paved the way for women like Ms. Haspel, who would be the C.I.A.\u2019s first female director if she is confirmed.\n\nThe C.I.A. has also sent out news releases touting Ms. Haspel, starting with her appointment as deputy director. In one instance, the agency took testimonials from former intelligence officials noting she was \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cobjective.\u201d The agency took the opportunity to remind readers that she was \u201ccommitted to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nAnother time, the C.I.A. provided information to The Wall Street Journal and other major news outlets, and then promoted the stories in a news release: \u201cI.C.Y.M.I.: C.I.A. Introduces Gina Haspel to the American People.\u201d\n\nThe C.I.A. has relied on former agency officers such as Mr. Bennett to get the word out that Ms. Haspel would make an excellent director. Frank Archibald, who replaced Mr. Bennett as the chief of the clandestine service, said he consulted with the C.I.A. before chatting with a reporter but the choice was his to talk. Mr. Archibald, a respected veteran of many clandestine operations, said he \u201cwas making an exception for Gina\u201d to convey to the public that she would make a superb director.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis month, former American officials wrote a letter to the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, urging them to support Ms. Haspel\u2019s nomination. The letter was published in The Cipher Brief, a news site on intelligence seen as friendly to the C.I.A. The agency tweeted the story.\n\nNot every former agency official has embraced the campaign. John Sipher, who once ran covert operations against the Russians and retired from the agency in 2014, said he thought highly of Ms. Haspel but was uncomfortable with the C.I.A.\u2019s overt messaging.\n\nIt was, he said, \u201ckinda creepy.\u201d", "title": "How the C.I.A.

{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "That seems unlikely. Of course, activism can awaken people to the problems with supporting abusive governments. But if lectures about moral obligations made an enormous difference, the world would already look much better. Instead, those who care about human rights need to take seriously the forces that lead so many people to vote in majoritarian strongmen in the first place.\n\nThe truth is that the growth of international human rights politics has accompanied the very economic phenomena that have led to the rise of radical populism and nationalism today. In short, human rights activism made itself at home in a plutocratic world.\n\nIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was promulgated in 1948 amid the consolidation of welfare states in Europe and North America and which formed the basis of the human rights agenda, was supposed to enshrine social protections. But in the 1970s, when activists in the United States and Western Europe began to take up the cause of \u201chuman rights\u201d for the victims of brutal regimes, they forgot about that social citizenship. The signature group of that era, Amnesty International, focused narrowly on imprisonment and torture; similarly, Human Rights Watch rejected advocating economic and social rights.\n\nThis approach began to change after the Cold War, especially when it came to nongovernmental advocacy in post-colonial countries. But even then, human rights advocacy did not reassert the goal of economic fairness. Even as more activists have come to understand that political and civil freedom will struggle to survive in an unfair economic system, the focus has often been on subsistence.\n\nIn the 1990s, after the Cold War ended, both human rights and pro-market policies reached the apogee of their prestige. In Eastern Europe, human rights activists concentrated on ousting old elites and supporting basic liberal principles even as state assets were sold off to oligarchs and inequality exploded. In Latin America, the movement focused on putting former despots behind bars. But a neoliberal program that had arisen under the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet swept the continent along with democracy, while the human rights movement did not learn enough of a new interest in distributional fairness to keep inequality from spiking.", "title": "Opinion | How the Human Rights Movement Failed", "authors": []}

Gary Waldron, a Bronx-born IBM manager, refused to quietly tend his own garden; instead, working with the nonprofit Group Live-In Experience, he planted one the size of a city block in the East Tremont section of his neglected native borough, setting it among the torched buildings and slumlord tenements, with the goal of giving jobs to disadvantaged youth. It was an added bonus that the tarragon and basil they cultivated turned up at the likes of Le Cirque and the Four Seasons; the restaurant Lavin\u2019s touted them on the menu as \u201cHerbs de Bronx.\u201d (It was an unlikely crossing point for the two New Yorks: those uplifted by Reagan\u2019s tax cuts and gospel of prosperity, and those not.)\n\nOn the Upper West Side, residents were still in mourning for their neighbor John Lennon, who was shot in early December 1980, under the archway of the Dakota co-op he called home. A few blocks away, at her tiny takeout shop, the Silver Palate, Sheila Lukins \u2014 a neighbor of Lennon\u2019s at the Dakota, from whom Yoko Ono ordered pecan pie daily in the months after his death \u2014 was starting a different revolution, showing home cooks how to make polished dishes that didn\u2019t require the convolutions of French technique. \u201cThe Silver Palate Cookbook,\u201d published in 1982 by Lukins and the shop\u2019s co-founder, Julee Rosso, would become one of the best-selling cookbooks in history. Even now, New Yorkers continue to consult its stained and creased pages to make chicken Marbella for dinner parties and Passover seders, leaving the bird to wallow overnight in vinegar, green olives, capers and prunes before roasting and then bearing it triumphantly to the table, wafting the scent of the Mediterranean.\n\nBut not every flavor beloved in the trickle-down years has retained its aura; some, particularly those associated with nouvelle cuisine, quickly soured. New York magazine\u2019s longtime restaurant critic Gael Greene lamented in her 2006 memoir that her early praise of white chocolate mousse triggered \u201can avalanche of soapy white chocolate.\u201d Boozy, caffeinated tiramis\u00f9, whose origins are traced back to Treviso, Italy, infiltrated the menus of Italian restaurants throughout New York, where the dessert remains today, its light dimmed but still occasionally capable of dazzling. Uramaki, an inverted form of sushi roll with rice outside and nori within, is said to have been improvised by a Japanese chef in Los Angeles to assuage 1970s-era diners squeamish about seaweed, and has since been viewed by purists as slightly suspect. But it did not seem out of place at Midtown\u2019s Hatsuhana in 1983 when The Times anointed it with four stars \u2014 one of five restaurants in the city at the time to receive the honor \u2014 transforming sushi in Manhattan from an expensive, forbidding novelty into an enduring status symbol.\n\nSoon, Starbucks, a small chain of stores based in Washington State that focused on selling whole coffee beans, would brew its first latte. By the time its first Manhattan storefront opened on the Upper West Side a decade later, the city had entered the age of the multinational corporation, when everything distinct and unique had become a commodity.\n\nStill, something of that early \u201980s restive spirit has stayed with us. During the breakdown of the \u201970s, families with means fled to the suburbs in even greater numbers than their \u201950s and \u201960s forebears. What saved the city was immigration, replenishing the population with 854,000 new arrivals between 1980 and 1989.

{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\n\n\u2022 Lowering prices\n\n\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\n\n\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\n\n\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.\n\nMore on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:\n\nThose policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.\n\nThe Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.\n\nIn an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.\n\nBut Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.\n\nMr. Legere is also well-known for his Twitter feed, a stream of posts that ranges from slow-cooker cuisine (Sunday\u2019s edition, published before the deal was announced, involved Kansas City-style ribs, a sly nod to Sprint\u2019s hometown) to his indoor cycling. But it also includes frequent taunts of his competitors, with Verizon and AT&T derided as \u201cdumb and dumber.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, after the collapse of a previous round of merger talks with Sprint, Mr. Legere posted this insult of his off-again, on-again deal partner:\n\nWhen I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nLegere\u2019s pitch to regulators.\n\nWinning over regulators is the top priority for the C.E.O.s of Sprint and T-Mobile. On CNBC this morning, Mr. Legere previewed the pitch he would be making:\n\n\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d \u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one. \u201cIf you liked the competition before, you\u2019re going to love what\u2019s coming with this one. \u201d\n\nMarcelo Claure is poised to be a big winner if the deal goes through.\n\nBloomberg reports that Sprint\u2019s chief executive stands to take home $78 million if the deal is completed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nT-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201d\n\nHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n2018 is shaping up to be the biggest year for deal making on record.\n\nSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007.\n\nMerger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.\n\nPhoto\n\nIs the third (or fourth) time the charm for Sprint and T-Mobile?\n\nYesterday\u2019s rollout of T-Mobile\u2019s $26.5 billion bid to buy Sprint \u2014 the companies\u2019 latest merger effort over the years \u2014 showed that both wireless carriers are laser-focused on winning over regulators. Their main talking points: Together they can build a robust 5G wireless network, keep prices low for consumers, and create jobs \u2014 particularly in rural areas. And the wireless market won\u2019t be a three-company business, with Comcast and others trying to break in.\n\nWhether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.\n\nA preview of Andrew\u2019s column on the deal, which will go up this afternoon:\n\nNo matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators. \u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201d\n\nMore on the T-Mobile-Sprint deal: SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son, who controls Sprint, finally gets the merger he has long craved, but walking away from talks last year cost him dearly. Customers shouldn\u2019t expect their phone bills to go up \u2014 at least, not right away.\n\nCritics\u2019 corner: The proposed transaction carefully targeted everything President Trump likes, according to Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews. If the deal fails, T-Mobile has a bright future, but Sprint doesn\u2019t, Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly writes.\n\nA bigger step toward financial firms limiting gun sales?\n\nBanks and credit card companies are reportedly looking at how to identify gun transactions in their payment systems, the WSJ reported on Monday\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:\n\nThe financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.\n\nThe first of those sounds similar to what Andrew called for in a column last month:\n\nIf the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.\n\nBut such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nHNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\n\nThe Chinese conglomerate plans to end its bid for SkyBridge Capital, the investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, The WSJ reports. The two firms might strike a partnership agreement instead, The WSJ reports, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Scaramucci announced in January 2017 that he was selling SkyBridge to a consortium led by RON Transatlantic and HNA Capital of China. The move came as Mr. Scaramucci was pursuing a position with the Trump administration. Terms of the deal were not announced, but reports at the time pegged its value at around $200 million.\n\nThe transaction, if it is called off, will be the latest to fall apart under scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. Those deals include Broadcom\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm, Ant Financial\u2019s purchase of MoneyGram, and Canyon Bridge Capital\u2019s acquisition of Lattice.\n\nPhoto\n\nChina plans to stake an assertive negotiating stance\n\nThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.\n\nKeith Bradsher of the NYT reports:\n\nThe Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance?

During two deployments to Iraq and one to Afghanistan, Lethgo trained local soldiers and police officers in basic first aid, including hoisting the injured and unconscious. \u201cFirst ask, \u2018Does this person really need to be moved?\u2019 \u201d Lethgo says.\n\nTo answer that question, you need what those in the military call \u201csituational awareness,\u201d or a rapid assessment of the scene using all your senses: Where are potential hazards? Is the person bleeding? Breathing? What made him or her unconscious? Are others nearby who could help? \u201cDon\u2019t take forever with it,\u201d Lethgo says, but make sure the person actually needs to be carried. \u201cDragging somebody is not a bad option,\u201d he says, especially if you\u2019re smaller and don\u2019t have far to go. If you\u2019re alone and you must move an inert body more than, say, 200 feet to safety, Lethgo recommends what\u2019s called the pack-strap carry, which looks something like a piggyback ride.\n\nRoll the individual onto his or her back, and push the person into a seated position. \u201cReach around and give them a big old bear hug from behind,\u201d Lethgo says.

Carefully lift the person to a standing position using your legs, not your back. \u201cLock their knees out,\u201d says Lethgo, which will help keep the person upright as you maneuver to the front side.

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "The bottom line is that the decisions made during loan servicing matter enormously to the financial well-being of millions of people. Market pressures alone won\u2019t improve the student loan industry because borrowers are locked to the servicer selected for them by the government and can\u2019t vote with their feet.\n\nThis leaves the government as the only real hope for keeping servicers in line. Yet the Trump administration has scaled back oversight of the loan companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which acted as a loan watchdog under the Obama administration, has been relatively quiescent the past year. In fact, Mick Mulvaney, its new director, is seeking legislation that would weaken the agency.\n\nIn the absence of federal action, some states have stepped in to protect borrowers. But in response to industry complaints, the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, has warned state regulators not to supervise loan companies, claiming her department has sole jurisdiction over them. Even if the states continue to persevere, their actions won\u2019t substitute for comprehensive federal oversight.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? We could make the loan system less difficult for borrowers to navigate. In particular, borrowers should be enrolled automatically in an income-based program if they fall behind on their payments. The lengthy process for enrolling and staying in these programs should be simplified, with tax records used to automatically determine payments.\n\nEven better would be a system of payroll withholding, like those in England and Australia, where loan payments automatically fluctuate with earnings. Some people oppose this approach, arguing that payroll deduction elevates student loans over food and rent as payment priorities. But this misses the strongest protection of payroll withholding: It automatically cuts payments to zero when earnings drop low enough, putting loans at the bottom of the payment hierarchy.\n\nAs it is, we have a punishing system of garnishment in place for student loans. In 2017, the blandly named Treasury Offset Program seized $2.8 billion from student borrowers who were in default. These funds were taken from federal earned-income tax credit, Black Lung Benefits and Social Security payments that would have gone to retired, disabled or deceased workers and their families.\n\nIt makes little sense to have the federal government seize money from these most vulnerable families while shying away from a sensible system of payroll withholding for active workers.", "title": "How to Clean Up the Student Loan Mess", "authors": []}

Colwell, the chief of emergency medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. You may need to remove or rip open some of the victim\u2019s clothing to access the injury. \u201cGrab a shirt, a towel, a fabric bag \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be clean,\u201d Colwell says. Put the cloth over the wound, and push down continuously and forcefully on it with both hands until the bleeding stops.\n\nIf you see blood spurting, pooling or rapidly soaking through clothing, consider the situation life-threatening. Uncontrolled bleeding is the primary cause of preventable death from trauma. Of the American military personnel who died on the battlefield between 2001 and 2011, researchers found that nearly a quarter were bleed-out deaths that were \u201cpotentially survivable.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need extensive training to save a life,\u201d Colwell says. Move quickly; a severed main vessel near the heart or in the groin can result in death within minutes, but with arms and leg injuries you\u2019ll often have more time. You may need to put your hands inside the gash. Try to avoid getting blood in your eyes or mouth, but don\u2019t fret about disease as long as you don\u2019t have open wounds on your own hands. \u201cThe risk to you is very low, and the benefit to somebody who\u2019s bleeding rapidly is very high,\u201d Colwell says.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been compressing the wound for 20 or 30 seconds and it\u2019s still bleeding heavily, you need to use a tourniquet. Colwell keeps a first-aid tourniquet in his car and would like to see them placed in schools, stadiums and every large building. Until then, you\u2019ll probably have to improvise. A belt works, as does a tie, shoelaces, even a bra. Place the tourniquet an inch or so higher than the wound and tighten until the bleeding stops. If you\u2019re the injured one, you can compress and tourniquet your own wound.\n\nColwell has seen people bleed to death when they might have been saved. He was the on-scene physician after the shooting at Columbine High School; he worked in an E.R. that received victims of the movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colo. Anticipate \u2014 and resist \u2014 the woozy fright often triggered by a profusion of blood. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to act,\u201d Colwell says.", "title": "How to Control Bleeding", "authors": []}

To know what you\u2019re up against, research the safe\u2019s manufacturer, make, model and materials. At a minimum, you\u2019ll need a drill; diamond and tungsten carbide drill bits, capable of boring into reinforced metals; an optical device called a borescope; and a stethoscope.\n\nPut your stethoscope over the lock as if it were a heart. As you turn the dial, try to feel and hear the notches lining up on the series of interlocking wheels inside. This is what locksmiths call \u201cmanipulation,\u201d and it\u2019s considered the purest form of safecracking. If that doesn\u2019t work, drill a hole next to the lock, and insert your borescope to line up the notches by sight. If you\u2019re not in a hurry, a robotic dialer can be attached to the safe that automatically tries every possible combination. Use brute force \u2014 cutting through the container with an oxyacetylene torch, say \u2014 as a last resort. That can be dangerous and trigger the anti-theft technology in some safes, like relocking mechanisms or even embedded tear-gas canisters.\n\nAny items inside will tend to be valuable, lethal, unlawful or contested. Therisod, who mostly gets calls to work on mechanical safes with forgotten or long-lost combinations, has been hired by siblings feuding over estates, quarreling couples and federal law-enforcement officials. Sometimes multiple parties watch him work with their respective attorneys in tow. People are not always their best selves around safes. Therisod has seen safes full of guns or brimming with narcotics. If you\u2019re cracking a safe for others, always let them open the door to protect yourself from accusations of theft.\n\nBe forewarned: The vast majority of the time, an abandoned safe is empty. \u201cI tell people, 99 times out of 100 there\u2019s nothing inside,\u201d Therisod says. But humans are curious, covetous and prone to disregard terrible odds. Most opt to open a locked safe anyway, sometimes at significant cost. On a few occasions, Therisod has uncovered valuables, including stacks of cash, jewelry and gems. He has also, when he cracked a bank\u2019s safe deposit box, found a fish decomposing in a plastic bag. \u201cI smelled it before I saw it,\u201d he says.", "title": "How to Crack a Safe", "authors": ["Malia Wollan"]}

Many training courses on how to fall off a horse encourage riders to be careful about breaking their descent with their arms, but Anderson says that if you\u2019re going down head first, you should use your arms as a bumperlike \u201ccrumple zone\u201d: A broken wrist is better than brain trauma. Researchers have found that helmets reduce the risk of head injuries by as much as half, but fewer than a quarter of riders wear them, including Anderson, who opts for a cowboy hat instead.\n\nIn his stunt work, Anderson is usually being paid to look as though he has been shot off his horse, which means he needs to tumble in an uncontrolled, limbs-akimbo way and often land directly on his back or belly. For this type of fall, wear a protective vest and prepare the ground ahead of time by removing rocks and laying down sand or peat moss to make for a softer landing.\n\nIf you ride horses enough, you will eventually fall off; equestrians are admitted to the hospital at a rate of about once per 2,000 hours of riding, which is more than motorcyclists. Horse riders suffer higher rates of severe brain and body injuries than skiers, automobile racers and rugby and football players combined. Anderson has spent much of his life atop horses; he can ride standing with a foot planted on the back of two steeds galloping side by side.

Unfortunately this new hire, despite an exceptional amount of support and training for the past two months, is struggling. He has a good grasp of the job\u2019s content, but can\u2019t keep up with its pace, volume or administrative requirements.

Even if you have doubts about this, channel your inner optimist and come across as being focused on achieving solutions, not pointing out problems.\n\nNow tell the boss that the new guy was resistant to the suggested supervision \u2014 and you need to say that this is not acceptable. That\u2019s the best (and really only) way to make this new colleague work out in the long run, and you want to make sure you have your boss\u2019s support.\n\nHaving buy-in from your boss will make the subsequent conversation with your troublesome newcomer easier.

Church members address one another as brother and sister, and like gang members, they are expected to look out for one another, providing jobs, shelter and food when needed. Churches are also highly patriarchal.\n\nMany evangelical churches tackle the gang menace not just on a spiritual and an emotional level but also a practical one. They provide jobs and job contacts, informal child-care services, and access to health care. Perhaps most important, they monopolize their members\u2019 time.

{"date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "text": "Because my body is failing, I have enlisted the aid of a colleague, the education journalist Peg Tyre, who has long shared my views. Together, we will lay out some fundamental steps that people of good conscience might take to make sure higher education is aligned with the democratic values we share.\n\nLet\u2019s start with alumni. It is common to harbor fond feelings toward your alma mater. But to be a responsible, forward-looking member of your college\u2019s extended community, look a little deeper. Make it your business to figure out exactly whom your college serves. What is the economic breakdown of the current student body? Some colleges trumpet data about underrepresented minorities and first-generation students. But many don\u2019t. And either way, there are follow-up questions to ask. How has that mix changed over the past 10 years? What policies are in place to increase those numbers? You may not get a direct answer. No matter. When they call you as part of the annual fund-raising drive, press the issue.\n\nBut you need to go further. Legacy admission must end. By some counts, children of alumni, almost all of them from the top economic quartile, account for 10 percent to 25 percent of the students at the top 100 universities. In 2011, an analysis of 30 elite schools found that legacy candidates saw a 23 percentage point increase in their chances of getting in compared with otherwise similar candidates. Among the Harvard class of 2021, 29 percent had a parent, grandparent or close family relation who attended the school.\n\nColleges say they need legacy admissions to encourage donations. But a 2010 study by Chad Coffman, Tara O\u2019Neil and Brian Starr looked at alumni donations at the top 100 universities and found no discernible impact of legacy admission on giving. Leading universities, including M.I.T., Caltech and Berkeley, don\u2019t allot extra credit to legacies. We need to press all schools to do the same. Your child is likely to have a great life even if he or she never sleeps in the same freshman dorm you did.\n\nNext, let\u2019s shorten the college tour. College admissions officers, who opted for the Common Application to make multiple applications to college easier, subsequently tried to weed out the not-so-serious applicants by making a pre-application college visit and a tour weigh in favor of an applicant. They call it \u201cdemonstrated interest,\u201d but what it mainly signifies is a family\u2019s ability to pay for a trip and not much more. The college tours, which for wealthy families gobble up vacation time for most of their child\u2019s junior year in high school, are another way to signify the means, not the seriousness, of a candidate. Princeton and Emory, to name two, do not factor demonstrated interest into their admissions decisions. The rest should follow.\n\nBroadly speaking, more people are going to college. To help students who come from the middle and working classes, cities and states should adopt models like the City University of New York\u2019s ASAP program, which provides intensive advising, money for textbooks and even MetroCards to smooth a student\u2019s pathway to his or her degree.\n\nMore name-brand colleges could do what Bard College has done: Refine the first two years of their four-year liberal arts education into an accredited Bard associate degree. They work with local partners to offer the degree in \u201cmicrocolleges\u201d within libraries and community centers. Their first four students \u2014 all low-income women with children who never considered applying to elite schools \u2014 are graduating from the pilot microcollege, in poverty-stricken Holyoke, Mass., this spring. One has been admitted as a transfer student to both Smith and Mount Holyoke, an almost unimaginable leap. The others are waiting to hear whether they will get to transfer to other selective colleges in the region with enough financial aid and child care to make it a reality.\n\nAnd please, let\u2019s not act like everyone already has the road map to college plotted. The college application system has become costly and baroque. Middle- and working-class kids rely on high school guidance counselors to help them navigate college admission and financial aid. But according to the latest figures, the average national ratio of high school students to counselors runs as high as 482 to 1. We must make it possible for high schools to hire, train and deploy enough guidance counselors, or we will have proved that we are not taking this issue seriously.", "title": "Opinion | How to Level the College Playing Field", "authors": []}

If you don\u2019t like President Trump, you will be served more and more anti-Trump articles as the algorithm tries to maximize your engagement, which in turn increases potential ad dollars. Revenue tied to sensational but phony news articles proved good for the bottom line. Until, that is, people started to complain, prompting fact-checking schemes, which in turn generated complaints about the political biases of those fact-checkers. In our ideologically diverse world, it\u2019s impossible for any single news distributor to fact-check and rank the news with complete objectivity.\n\nHistorically, editors and not algorithms made news judgments at TV networks, radio stations, newspapers and magazines. The biases of different editors were balanced by rules that limited the power, reach and ownership of any single outlet, thus ensuring diversity of content.\n\nNow, suppose we looked at the internet not as the private preserve of a few huge corporations, but as a public good to be treated no differently from how we treated the licensing of radio and TV stations. We could create new rules intended to force the major internet companies like Facebook and Google to choose one of two paths. They could be fully responsible for all the content on their networks, subject to libel laws (which they are not now). Or they could operate more like broadband providers that license \u201cchannels\u201d to media companies that are responsible for their own content, in the way that cable TV companies agree to carry selected channels. My guess is that they would choose the latter.\n\nTo stay in news distribution and yet avoid greater liability, they could step back from the editorial ranking business and adopt a system similar to what the government helped create with TV and radio. Following this approach, Facebook and Google, because of their unique market power in social and search, would each create a limited number of promoted but ideologically diverse news channels that could be auctioned off to responsible publishers, who would in turn agree to stringent fact-checking and content-responsibility rules. Violations of the rules would cost them their status as a certified channel.\n\nUsers then would select which channels they wanted in their feeds or allow the internet platforms to pick a selection of those channels on the basis of expressed ideology or interests \u2014 political, sports or celebrity news, liberal versus conservative. Search results from the certified channels would be listed first, and posting of items from these sources would carry special status and priority over nonlicensed sources. The revenue model would also be shifted from individual articles that draw clicks to channels that would have to meet standards and could pay annual licensing fees to the platforms. The channels would make money by selling ads or charging for premium content.", "title": "Opinion | How to Make Facebook More Accountable", "authors": []}

I\u2019m not sure yet how we might draw a connection, but there is potential here!\n\nTAUSIG: Agreed \u2014 great lead for a theme. Let\u2019s take a quick aside to talk about mechanics. Note that Finn put the name of the theme-answer-to-be, TRIXIE MATTEL, in all-caps, which is a common convention. He also put the letter count in parentheses. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll want to keep track of while we brainstorm.\n\nVIGELAND: Indeed, we\u2019ll need pairs of equally long theme answers so that we can obey one of the more rigid rules of crosswords: placing your theme answers in symmetrical positions in the grid.\n\nTAUSIG: Whatever the lengths, they have to be paired to meet another rule of crossword constructing: most themed grids are diagonally symmetrical for aesthetic reasons. The only exception is if you have an entry running across the center, which wouldn\u2019t have a symmetrical partner. A theme entry set with two (13)s and one (15) would still have symmetry if the (15) ran in the middle row. We\u2019ll aim for a total theme entry letter count of about 40 letters for an easy theme like the one we\u2019re making today.\n\nBack to the Drawing Board\n\nTAUSIG: TRIXIE MATTEL is a great spark, but I can already see a limitation. Namely, the \u201cgame\u201d aspect of our theme is in the word MATTEL. Themes have to be consistent. To make a consistent theme from this, we would need to find at least three phrases with the name of a game company in them. Can we find phrases with HASBRO or LEGO that have nothing to do with the game companies themselves?\n\nVIGELAND: Good point. Unfortunately, after a quick consultation of the Wikipedia list of game manufacturers, I see that we might be out of luck. Ben made a great point. We want phrases that don\u2019t have to do with the actual toy companies \u2014 we lose the wordplay aspect if LEGOLAND was a theme entry, because LEGO in there already refers to the company. The MATTEL in TRIXIE MATTEL has nothing to do with the company, which would have made her an excellent entry in this theme set.

It was a job I had planned to leave \u2014 in fact, I got my notice about two weeks before I was going to quit! My plan was to travel around the world for several months before looking for a new position, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for the last three months.

Perhaps, for instance, exposure to other cultures will make you a more empathetic manager. The connections don\u2019t have to be explicit, just defensible. (And you should adjust which ones you emphasize for different potential employers; tweaking a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for specific jobs is often a good idea.)\n\nBut keep it concise. Your actual work skills and experience are a lot more important than any travel lessons, and you don\u2019t want to leave the impression that this three-month break meant more to you than your entire previous career.\n\nFinally, if your main travel achievement turns out to be increasing your tolerance for margaritas and breaking a personal record for consecutive hours slept, you\u2019ll either need to get extremely creative \u2014 or do some judicious editing.

There were the years when I worked for a food magazine with an expense account, and the years when my wife and I lived free of day care and diaper bills, so there are happy memories: the time I saw her weep, overcome by the flavor of a dish of strawberries; the time we spent an entire meal, rapt, watching servers glide toward tables, their dishes alighting in balletic unison.\n\nBut now we have a 2-year-old. We don\u2019t get to restaurants much anymore. Instead, one recent night I spent dinnertime wincing as my daughter dunked a fistful of tuna into her milk, then smeared her fishy fingers on my shirt. I watched her small hands maul a stump of broccoli, then palm it into her jaws to chew it, open-mouthed. Objectively, it was disgusting. But that sight may have made me the happiest I have ever been at the table. For months, I stood by, biologically useless as my wife gave our daughter milk, so feeding her food I\u2019ve made is the closest I\u2019ve ever felt to being truly important.\n\nMy daughter likes broccoli. And mushrooms. Most any vegetable, well roasted, really, and so I roast all the broccoli, mushrooms and whatever other thing I can get my hands on to feel the high of watching my child eat. But after that, after bath time and bedtime, half-passed-out and kept awake mostly by the hunger in our own bellies, my wife and I turn to those vegetables to sustain ourselves.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that the best way to make dinner on nights like that is to exalt in the glories of simple tastes. Along with those vegetables, I almost always keep in the fridge some eggs and a couple of cups of wheat berries rattling around in a container, cooked on a Sunday night with the TV on and next week\u2019s vegetables in the oven. This way, we\u2019re always just minutes away from grain-bowl time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is no one way to make a grain bowl. There is no one recipe. There are paths, a varying series of little things to do in the kitchen that will add up to a delicious thing of many textures and flavors. But there is a structure; a formula. Grains, of course. I love wheat berries, or farro, or wild or brown rice because I love their nutty, mellow flavor and satisfying chew. Or sometimes I\u2019ll mix one of those with some quinoa or couscous because they\u2019re tender and friable on the tongue, and the two textures bounce off each other. My bowls always have vegetables and probably have those eggs, because even great eggs are cheap protein, and they somehow make any assortment of foods feel like a legitimate meal.

{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "The next part is a little tricky: Freedom cards are technically cash back cards that earn points redeemable at a penny each. But those points become much more powerful when you transfer them to a Sapphire or Business Preferred card (which is done easily on the Chase website), as you can then redeem them for a bonus in the travel portal and transfer them to travel partners.\n\nThis quarter (April through June), for example, those categories include grocery stores. That means $100 worth of groceries earns you 500 points, or five percent back on your spending. But those points can be transferred to your Sapphire Reserve and redeemed for travel at a 50 percent bonus, meaning it\u2019s an effective return rate of 7.5 percent. The Freedom Unlimited, which is uncapped and gives you a 1.5 percent return on all categories, can also transfer points to the Sapphire Reserve, earning that 50 percent bonus. This equates to a 2.25 percent return on all spending when you redeem for travel.\n\nCiti ThankYou Rewards\n\nThe Citi Prestige is the centerpiece of the ThankYou Rewards suite of cards, and it has some fantastic perks: It has trip delay insurance benefits that are significantly better than those of its competitors, and offers a unique free fourth night hotel benefit that can pay for the card\u2019s annual fee by itself. That means your fourth night of a consecutive four-night stay is completely free, from fleabag motels to the Four Seasons, provided you book through Citi. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nNow, the not-so-good: Citi isn\u2019t quite on the level of American Express and Chase when it comes to its transfer partners which, as we know, offer the best points redemption value. Whereas Chase has United and Southwest Airlines as points transfer partners, and American Express can claim Delta, Citi doesn\u2019t claim a major American legacy carrier. Partners Avianca (Star Alliance) and Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific) can still offer good redemption values, but cardholders may find less value in partners like Garuda Indonesia and Malaysia Airlines, which don\u2019t fly to North America. Finally, while Chase has four hotel transfer partners, including IHG and Hyatt, Citi has zero.\n\nAs with American Express and Chase, I\u2019d generally recommend forgoing the use of points to pay for purchases, merchandise and gift cards.\n\nAmassing Points\n\nUnless you\u2019re putting tons of spend on your credit cards every month, the most efficient way to get points quickly is through sign-up bonuses \u2014 the Chase Sapphire Reserve, for example, currently offers a 50,000 point bonus (possibly higher if you apply in-branch) when you spend $4,000 in the first three months of having the account open. I monitor forums and travel blogs (Doctor of Credit is good) to see what offers are out there.\n\nA couple of things to keep in mind: Some cards have high annual fees \u2014 Chase Sapphire Reserve is $450, American Express Platinum is $550 \u2014 that only are offset if you manage to collect the bonus. Always make sure you can hit the target spend amount before signing up. Most importantly, I don\u2019t recommend juggling a bunch of new credit cards to anyone who can\u2019t pay their balance in full every month. The point is to make money, not give it back to the banks.\n\nI\u2019m fastidious about avoiding interest and late fees, and don\u2019t feel guilty canceling high annual fee cards once I\u2019ve collected my bonus, thus I rarely hesitate to jump on a good sign-up offer. If the banks want to help pay for my next trip, at little or no cost to me, I\u2019m all for it.", "title": "How to Navigate the Complicated World of Credit Card Points", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "Another problem is the stupefying amount of administration that diplomats overseas have to contend with, instead of practicing diplomacy; many have taken to calling it \u201ce-hell.\u201d It gets in the way of the very reason they live in foreign countries \u2014 to understand and analyze developments in those countries and engage with their societies to better inform United States policies.\n\nWhat about the staffing gaps overseas every summer, when officers start new assignments at embassies and consulates weeks or even months after their predecessors have left? Even in the age of instant communication, this leads to a lack of continuity and a need for almost every new officer to reinvent the wheel.\n\nAs for those outside government, internationally focused think tanks could play a role in producing research on trends and innovation in diplomatic practice. They have largely ignored that, saying their job is to study foreign policy, not what some call \u201cthe machinery\u201d that carries it out. The main reason for that is funding \u2014 it\u2019s much easier to find donors willing to finance policy research, which they hope will influence official government decisions. However, given the damage being done to the machinery, getting the process right will be as important as the policy substance on the other side of the dark age.\n\nAcademia can help as well. The Trump administration\u2019s policies and actions have significantly diminished the attractiveness of diplomacy as a career for young Americans. As a result, the number of those taking the Foreign Service exam has decreased by nearly half since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and compared with pre-2017 figures, fewer than a third of new officers are being accepted into the Foreign Service.\n\nSo it\u2019s vital to keep alive the young generation\u2019s interest in and pursuit of diplomacy as a career. But it\u2019s difficult to find colleges and universities in the United States (and globally, for that matter) that teach diplomacy. Not international relations, but diplomatic practice. Even schools whose names include the words \u201cdiplomacy\u201d or \u201cforeign service\u201d offer no more than a couple of diplomacy-related courses, one of which is usually in diplomatic history.\n\nTo that end, my school, the Washington International Diplomatic Academy, which trains diplomats and other international affairs professionals from around the world, is holding a practical training program for students this summer for the first time. They will learn what is increasingly becoming a lost art, as well as specific skills, from some of the best diplomats in recent years, including recent State Department refugees. Still, I\u2019d rather see dozens of universities offer multiyear degree programs.\n\nThe longer the United States fails to exercise its diplomatic muscle, the worse its atrophy will get. Future Foreign Service leaders could emerge from its current ranks or among Americans still in college. Naturally, they will aspire to become ambassadors and assistant secretaries. But once at the top, despite the huge political demands of those jobs, they should find time to take care of their colleagues in the service.

Many had been awaiting the decision for years; the alert, one of several hundreds The Times will send this year, took readers straight to the breaking news on nytimes.com.\n\nTens of thousands of people accessed the article through the alert; arresting details and emotional content often draw readers in this way, said Michael Owen, editor of the news desk. Every story that lands on a lock screen is a chance to build a relationship with the reader \u2014 or erode it. \u201cIt has to do one or the other for every alert we send, even if the effect is subtle,\u201d he added. \u201cWe always want it to get better.\u201d\n\nPart of that means cultivating \u201ca more human voice,\u201d according to Eric Bishop, assistant editor for mobile at The Times who leads push notification strategy alongside Mr. Owen. The strategy has shifted from simply alerting headlines, two and a half years ago, to something much more lively and conversational today.\n\nPush alerts at The Times had unexpected beginnings. Two and half years ago, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Owen and a team of editors, developers and designers were faced with the challenge of developing alerts for the nascent Apple Watch app. What they came up with was the \u201cone-line story\u201d: packing articles into bite-size pieces that were chattier and more approachable than traditional headlines.\n\nMr. Owen and Mr. Bishop later found that a similar premise worked on mobile platforms, but with added context. \u201cWhen we included more information in the push, we saw higher engagement,\u201d Mr. Owen said, noting that, as the team progressively answered more fundamental questions \u2014 the whos, whats, whens, wheres and whys \u2014 they found a wider audience with each additional detail.\n\nAlerts usually run under 140 characters, to keep them from getting cut off, but that\u2019s not a hard and fast rule. Each day brings a different number and mix of alerts depending on the gravity of a story and the pace of a news cycle, and each year brings new technology \u2014 the team recently unveiled its first alerts with embedded photo, for example.\n\nThe decision for when to send an alert and how, much of the time, comes down to instinct. These days, the team looks forward to the quirky stories, or \u201csome lyrical or amusing detail,\u201d Mr. Owen said. Recent examples include a notification that described reporters\u2019 frozen eyelashes on the scene of a bomb cyclone in early January. One notification alerting a viewer\u2019s guide to \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d advised readers to read it, \u201cOr don\u2019t. We\u2019re not your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way not only to hook people, but also to delight them, which is something we don\u2019t get a ton of opportunities to do as a news operation,\u201d Mr. Owen said. \u201cWhen we get that opportunity, it\u2019s a good way to break up the drumbeat of more serious stuff that we send.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an exact science: In January, after alerts with mistakes warranted corrections, editors put in place new protocol to vet the alerts for accuracy and work with those who had written the stories in question and knew them best. \u201cAs we sent a greater and greater volume of push notifications, we hadn\u2019t really adjusted how we worked to keep the level of quality consistent,\u201d Mr. Owen noted. The notification\u2019s quality, he said, is by far the priority over its speed.\n\nMr. Owen and Mr. Bishop try to stay mindful today of how intrusive the alerts can feel, especially in an era in which breaking news is relentless. They ask themselves constantly where a reader\u2019s daily and hourly tolerance lies. (The alerts team can see if a reader has turned off notifications within an hour of receiving one \u2014 potentially a sign they\u2019ve annoyed somebody.) \u201cWe try to be empathetic,\u201d Mr. Bishop said.\n\nMr. Bishop wants the arc to bend toward more of a two-way conversation, hopefully implementing a way for readers to give feedback on alerts in real time. Some things, after all, remain out of the scope of analytics: for example, \u201cif someone is delighted by a push but doesn\u2019t open it.\u201d", "title": "How to Push a Story", "authors": ["Melina Delkic"]}

If you do choose to shop at a baby resale store, make sure the owners take this kind of safety seriously.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

Your community can also offer services for cheap or free, if you know where to look. Workouts are a prime example: Why spend money on a gym membership when you can work out with a highly motivated group of people in the park?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what November Project aims to do. Originally born in Boston, November Project is completely free, organized by volunteers and takes place in 45 cities around the world. Twice a week, these motivated people get together in the mornings to do workouts that include running, body weight exercises and circuit training. It\u2019s intense and energetic, but the workouts are formulated so that people of varying skill levels can join \u2014 whether you\u2019re an Olympic athlete or an average Joe or Jane looking to get in shape. Best of all, there\u2019s no sign up required: Just show up. And if there isn\u2019t a November Project in your area, you can start one \u2014 or find a similar group that almost certainly already exists.\n\nThe obvious: thrift stores, swap meets and Craigslist\n\nWe\u2019d be remiss not to mention some of the more obvious options you already know about, like local thrift stores, consignment shops and swap meets. These types of organizations have been around forever and they can still be a great way to save money \u2014 though they\u2019re usually better for browsing than trying to find something specific. (Remember that Goodwill isn\u2019t the only thrift store around, either \u2014 there are probably locally owned ones that are less trafficked or specialize in different kinds of items.)\n\nIn addition, apps like Craigslist \u2014 and lesser-known counterparts like LetGo and OfferUp \u2014 are always great ways to find good deals on furniture, electronics or anything else you might be searching for. Cast a wide net and don\u2019t be afraid to negotiate \u2014 any experienced seller will expect it and that\u2019s how you go from a good deal to a great one.\n\nHow to find these organizations in your neighborhood\n\nEvery city and town is different, and finding the local version of the above organizations is the real challenge. If you know where to look, though, you can make things a bit easier on yourself. Be sure to check:\n\n\u2022 Facebook: Facebook isn\u2019t just for following friends and news outlets. The revamped Groups feature is a great way to find local community groups and a lot of the above organizations will have pages on Facebook, if you do a bit of searching.\n\n\u2022 NextDoor: Billed as a social network for your neighborhood, NextDoor\u2019s main feed is mostly full of people selling stuff (which itself can be useful). But you can also use the sidebar to look up events (often hosted by local organizations that you can look into), recommended businesses and people offering up services at a discount to their neighbors.\n\n\u2022 Your city\u2019s subreddit: If you\u2019ve ever browsed Reddit, the internet\u2019s community-for-literally-everything, you should check out the subreddit for your city. Below all the memes and cool photos of the skyline, you\u2019ll find people asking about (or sharing) local business information, cool deals for local attractions and other useful information. You can even create a new thread asking for good places to find what you\u2019re looking for!\n\n\u2022 Yelp: Never discount the obvious: Yelp is still one of the best ways to find well-regarded local businesses. It might be tough if you aren\u2019t sure what you\u2019re even looking for, but when it comes to the more prevalent options like thrift stores and consignment shops, Yelp is a great place to find the best ones.\n\n\u2022 Other organizations: You know the organizations I mentioned above? They partner with other organizations that have similar goals. For example, the University of San Diego\u2019s e-waste center partners with a local church group called Jesus Geeks which provides, among other things, inexpensive \u201ctech support\u201d fund-raising nights, where you can get tech support for much less than what most big box stores charge. If you find an organization you like, poke around their website or related Facebook groups to see what else might interest you.\n\nOnce you get on a roll, you\u2019ll be surprised how many great resources you can find right in your own neighborhood. Remember to pay it forward, too \u2014 if these organizations have helped you out, don\u2019t be afraid to offer your own unwanted stuff for donation, too.", "title": "How to Save Money With the Help of Your Community", "authors": ["Whitson Gordon"]}
{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "As Nero worsened, Seneca attempted to leave. Joining Nero\u2019s administration was easy, but an exit was not. Nero could not afford to lose his most influential adviser, or allow the perception that someone as well known as Seneca was cutting ties with him. Seneca was granted a quiet sabbatical at Nero\u2019s whim \u2014 the modern equivalent of a jointly issued news release.\n\nSeneca had finally come to experience the truth of the words of the Roman poet Horace, whose work had greatly influenced him: \u201cTo have a great man for a friend seems pleasant to those who have never tried it; those who have, fear it.\u201d\n\nIn a larger sense, Seneca\u2019s struggle has echoes into our time, especially in politics. Last year, Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who has both criticized Donald Trump and supported many of his policies, tweeted a quote from Seneca about tyranny, prompting some to ask if he was subtweeting the president. Ken Kurson, the former editor in chief of The New York Observer and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner during the election, told me that the Stoics were an inspiration to him as he dealt with the ethical and personal challenges of his position.\n\nMy own early career involved some questionable service to businesspeople. Employed and paid by them, I planned and carried out controversial publicity stunts, and used dishonest tactics with the public and the media. When I finally left those roles, I found a knowledge of Stoic philosophy integral to my ability to assess my past actions, and set a more honorable course going forward.\n\nIn a remarkable essay titled \u201cOn Leisure,\u201d published after Seneca retired, the philosopher wrote in an oblique way about his own experiences: \u201cThe duty of a man is to be useful to his fellow-men; if possible, to be useful to many of them; failing this, to be useful to a few; failing this, to be useful to his neighbors, and, failing them, to himself: for when he helps others, he advances the general interests of mankind.\u201d\n\nRemoved from the day-to-day of Rome\u2019s geopolitics (helping the many), he seemed to have a newfound appreciation for helping the few. Seneca seemed to realize only belatedly that one can contribute to his fellow citizens in ways other than through the state \u2014 for instance, by writing or simply by being a good man at home. There is some irony in the fact that as an individual, the famous letters and essays Seneca wrote would not only have a bigger impact than his work in politics but also in time would whitewash his contributions to a horrible regime.\n\nIn 65 A.D., Seneca would again find that philosophy did not exist only in the ethereal world. Conspirators began to plot against Nero\u2019s life, and Seneca, finally accepting that the monster he had helped create needed to be stopped, appears to have participated \u2014 or covered for those who did.\n\nThe effort failed but provided Seneca an opportunity: His life up to that point had contradicted many of his own teachings, but now when Nero\u2019s guards came and demanded his life, he would be brave and wise. The man who had written much about learning how to die and facing the end without fear would comfort his friends, finish an essay he was writing and distribute some finished pieces for safekeeping. Then, he slit his veins, took hemlock and succumbed to the suffocating steam of a bath.", "title": "Opinion | How to Serve a Deranged Tyrant, Stoically", "authors": []}

Worse still, because you can\u2019t see your errors, you\u2019ll never know you need to correct. (If this all sounds familiar, you\u2019ve probably heard of the classic study in which 80 percent of surveyed drivers ranked their driving skills as \u201cabove average.\u201d Noodle on that one.)\n\nConversely, the better we get at something, the likelier we are to see how much more we can improve, which can sometimes lead us to underestimate ourselves. Similarly, those who are exceptionally skilled at something can sometimes think everyone else is at that level, making them unaware of how exceptional their abilities are. Think: Impostor syndrome.\n\nWe all do this! It\u2019s simply in our nature, so it\u2019s not a behavior meant to deceive others or to unreasonably prop up our own ego.

Mr. Strumsky didn\u2019t just resist the idea, he detested it.

This may be disingenuous on the part of North Korea, but that\u2019s not terrible: It provides a face-saving way for both North Korea and the U.S. to back away from the precipice of war.\n\nTrump and Kim both badly want a meeting, so expect North Korea to release its three American detainees in the coming weeks and to make soothing statements. Trump and Kim will present themselves as historic peacemakers as they sign some kind of declaration calling for peace and denuclearization, with some kind of timetable; Trump\u2019s aides will then say that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize more than Barack Obama did.\n\nI hope Trump will also raise human rights issues.

Mr. Jackson, Ms. McKenney, a university trustee and Dr. Frederick gathered on the steps of the administration building to announce them.

But we have to recognize there\u2019s more to it, where you have to have a relationship with students.\u201d\n\nDr. Frederick, who declined to comment for this article, has sustained support from key campus groups: the trustees, the alumni association and the university\u2019s council of deans, which speaks for the heads of Howard\u2019s schools and colleges. Some instructors, against the prevailing mood of students, have urged patience with the established order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Hogan, who graduated from Howard in 2003, was part of a group of 20 faculty and staff members who signed a letter in support of Dr. Frederick during the sit-in. He has since had to defend himself to students upset about his public backing of the president.\n\n\u201cOn a president\u2019s watch, good things can happen and bad things can happen, and those things can be attributed to the president in ways he or she might not be responsible for,\u201d Professor Hogan said.\n\nOne of the president\u2019s central responsibilities is raising private donations to supplement the money the university receives from the government. The financial aid scandal came as the school was celebrating federal funding increases, including nearly $40 million for a program that supports black colleges, and $10.6 million for Howard\u2019s academic programs, endowment and hospital, which has struggled with lawsuits and layoffs in recent years.\n\nAdministering that hospital, along with a large undergraduate college and several professional and graduate schools, has saddled Howard with heavy financial burdens. That many of Howard\u2019s students come from modest means and rely on financial aid (a majority of students of historically black colleges and universities rely on Pell Grants) only adds to those strains.\n\nThis made the announcement of the financial aid misappropriation even more agonizing to Howard students and staff members, many of whom said the university was often held up as a standard-bearer for black colleges.\n\n\u201cPeople feel like if Howard can experience these problems, what does that mean for other H.B.C.U.s that aren\u2019t as big as Howard, who don\u2019t have the federal appropriations that Howard receives from the government?\u201d said Robert Palmer, an associate professor of education at the university.\n\nSome of those smaller colleges have lost their accreditations. Others have been dogged by declining donations from alumni.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this cycle that prevents them from donating again, once they see problems,\u201d said Bakari Sibert, a Howard sophomore who transferred from Morehouse College, an H.B.C.U. in Atlanta.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf there were some reworking of the system, this stigma about H.B.C.U.s not being efficient would solve itself,\u201d Mr. Sibert added.\n\nMarybeth Gasman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies historically black colleges, said Howard\u2019s most recent trials are a repeat of a phenomenon she has long observed: that black universities are held publicly accountable for their problems and one another\u2019s in a way larger, mostly white universities are not.\n\n\u201cPart of this,\u201d she said of the conflicts at Howard, \u201cis if you\u2019re at one institution, that\u2019s your experience. You don\u2019t know it\u2019s going on at other institutions.\u201d\n\nOutside observers, Professor Gasman said, \u201ctake one H.B.C.U. college problem and generalize it.\u201d\n\nDespite the recent conflicts, there have been ripples of optimism at Howard. The students\u2019 interactions with administrators \u2014 and the university\u2019s subsequent commitments \u2014 have encouraged faith in the long-term health of the institution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always an inside joke in the Howard family: new Howard, old Howard. I think this is the turning point of the new Howard, where we can really start a new tradition of student administration,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to have us be here for another 150 years.\u201d\n\nEven amid protests this month \u2014 as sit-in participants made sandwiches for the homeless, registered voters and met with trustees \u2014 the rhythms of academic life endured.\n\nNear the end of the occupation early this month, Keneshia N. Grant, an assistant professor of political science at Howard, asked her students if they wanted to discuss the protests occurring just yards away from where they were sitting. They were interested, Professor Grant said, but after 10 minutes they asked to return to a discussion on gentrification.

The tax cut\u2019s proponents promised that it would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth and produce big gains in wages; they hoped that it would also yield big political dividends for the midterm elections.\n\nSo how\u2019s it going? Politically, the tax cut is a damp squib: Most voters say they haven\u2019t seen any boost to their paychecks, and Republicans are barely talking about the law in their political campaigns. But what about the economics?\n\nYou might be tempted to say that it\u2019s too early to tell. After all, the law has been in effect for only a few months, and we got our first look at post-tax-cut economic growth only last week. But here\u2019s the thing: To deliver on its backers\u2019 promises, the tax cut would have to produce a huge surge in business investment \u2014 not in the long run, not five or 10 years from now, but more or less right away. And there\u2019s no sign that anything like that is happening.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the economics here.\n\nAnything that increases the budget deficit should, other things being the same, lead to higher overall spending and a short-run bump in the economy (although there\u2019s no indication of such a bump in the first-quarter numbers, which were underwhelming). But if you want to boost overall spending, you don\u2019t have to give huge tax breaks to corporations.

Kelly, President Trump\u2019s chief of staff, floated the idea while he was serving as homeland security secretary.\n\nIf approved, the plan would have closed detention facilities that are designed to house families and replaced them with separate shelters for adults and children. The White House supported the move and convened a group of officials from several federal agencies to consider its merits. But the Department of Homeland Security has said the policy was never adopted.\n\nChildren removed from their families are taken to shelters run by nongovernmental organizations. There, workers seek to identify a relative or guardian in the United States who can take over the child\u2019s care. But if no such adult is available, the children can languish in custody indefinitely. Operators of these facilities say they are often unable to locate the parents of separated children because the children arrive without proper records.\n\nOnce a child has entered the shelter system, there is no firm process to determine whether they have been separated from someone who was legitimately their parent, or for reuniting parents and children who had been mistakenly separated, said a Border Patrol official, who was not authorized to discuss the agency\u2019s policies publicly.\n\n\u201cThe idea of punishing parents who are trying to save their children\u2019s lives, and punishing children for being brought to safety by their parents by separating them, is fundamentally cruel and un-American,\u201d said Michelle Bran\u00e9, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group that conducts interviews and monitoring at immigration detention centers, including those that house children. \u201cIt really to me is just a horrific \u2018Sophie\u2019s Choice\u2019 for a mom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMirian has pinballed across Texas, held at various times in three other detention centers. She is part of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of many immigrant parents seeking to prohibit family separations at the border.\n\nHer son\u2019s name, along with Mirian\u2019s surname, are being withheld for their safety. But in a declaration she filed in that case, she said she was never told why her son was being taken away from her. Since February, the only word she has received about him has come from a case manager at the facility in San Antonio where he is being held. Her son asked about her and \u201ccried all the time\u201d in the days after he arrived at the facility, the case worker said, adding that the boy had developed an ear infection and a cough.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI had no idea that I would be separated from my child for seeking help,\u201d Mirian said in her sworn statement. \u201cI am so anxious to be reunited with him.\u201d\n\nProtecting children at the border is complicated because there have, indeed, been instances of fraud. Tens of thousands of migrants arrive there every year, and those with children in tow are often released into the United States more quickly than adults who come alone, because of restrictions on the amount of time that minors can be held in custody. Some migrants have admitted they brought their children not only to remove them from danger in such places as Central America and Africa, but because they believed it would cause the authorities to release them from custody sooner.\n\nOthers have admitted to posing falsely with children who are not their own, and Border Patrol officials say that such instances of fraud are increasing.\n\nAs the debate carries on, pressure from the White House to enact a separation policy has continued. In conversations this month with Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration that the agency has not been aggressive enough in policing the border, according to a person at the White House who is familiar with the discussions.\n\nOfficials presented Mr. Trump with a list of proposals, including the plan to routinely separate immigrant adults from their children. The president urged Ms. Nielsen to move forward with the policies, the person said.\n\nBut even groups that support stricter immigration policies have stopped short of endorsing a family separation policy. Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, one such group, said that family separation should only be used as a \u201clast resort.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said that some migrants were using children as \u201chuman shields\u201d in order to get out of immigration custody faster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense at all for the government to just accept these attempts at fraud,\u201d Ms. Vaughan said. \u201cIf it appears that the child is being used in this way, it is in the best interest of the child to be kept separately from the parent, for the parent to be prosecuted, because it\u2019s a crime and it\u2019s one that has to be deterred and prosecuted.\u201d", "title": "Hundreds of Immigrant Children Have Been Taken From Parents at U.S. Border", "authors": ["Caitlin Dickerson"]}

Among the most frequent targets of Mr. Orban\u2019s scorn has been George Soros, the American billionaire and philanthropist who was born in Hungary.\n\nMs. Zgut said that Mr. Orban\u2019s attacks on Mr. Soros, and on the European Union and the United Nations, served a dual purpose: to channel the frustration of anti-establishment voters toward leaders in Brussels and to drive home his contention that migration is the driving factor behind Western accusations that his government was weakening the rule of law even as corruption spreads.\n\n\u201cIf he portrays Brussels and the E.U. as the enemy of the state, his voters might consider the E.U.\u2019s criticisms of the government as part of a broader conspiracy that questions the sovereign decisions of Hungarians,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why he keeps repeating that this clash between Brussels and Hungary is all about migration.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, however, it was not concern about the erosion of the rule of law that most galvanized opposition voters.

That was roughly the same as the seven largest opposition parties combined.\n\nFidesz also won convincingly in local elections, securing a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which will give the party a free hand to pursue still deeper legal and constitutional changes that have already given it firm control over courts and other state institutions.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what other measures Mr. Orban might pursue. But Mr. Orban said in a major speech in March that after the election he would seek \u201cmoral, political and legal amends\u201d against his critics. And he hinted last week that the government might try to amend the Constitution to stop the European Union from imposing migrant quotas.\n\nA first step may be a \u201cstop Soros\u201d law that would allow the government to impose financial and other penalties on nongovernmental organizations that assist asylum seekers and refugees.\n\nAlready, Mr. Orban\u2019s harsh talk about immigrants has been matched by policies to close off the country.

A bad day for the EU, a good one for Europe.\u201d\n\nGeert Wilders, the far-right leader in the Netherlands, congratulated Mr. Orban on Twitter, calling the vote \u201ca well deserved victory!\u201d France\u2019s Marine Le Pen suggested that the Hungarian election could be the start of a nationalist wave across the continent.\n\n\u201cA great and clear victory by Viktor Orban in Hungary: the reversal of values and the mass migration of the E.U. have once again been rebuffed,\u201d Ms. Le Pen tweeted. \u201cNationalists could gain a majority in the next European Parliament elections in 2019.\u201d\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if Mr. Orban\u2019s success can be replicated elsewhere.

Period.\u201d\n\nEven before Puerto Rico was raked by Hurricane Maria last September, its finances were in disarray. For many years, it had borrowed money to plug holes in its budget and to repay previous borrowings, building up a debt of more than $70 billion that it could not repay. Today its debt and unfunded pension obligations total more than $120 billion, or twice the size of its economy. And the economy has been shrinking, as residents leave for better prospects on the United States mainland.\n\nHowever, the hurricane has led to a big influx of disaster relief and private insurance payments, a bonanza that led Mr. Rossell\u00f3 to project that the island could end the next five years with a cumulative surplus of $6.3 billion.\n\nBut the oversight board warned that without significant fiscal and economic reforms, Puerto Rico would be left, after the current flurry of storm-related activity, back where it started \u2014 with an unproductive economy and too much debt.\n\nThe board meeting was called to certify Puerto Rico\u2019s new fiscal plan, a document intended to chart the way forward. Six of the seven voting members voted in favor of an amended plan that includes the new austerity measures.\n\nSince 2016 the island has been functioning under a federal law called Promesa, which gives it legal powers that are normally found only in bankruptcy \u2014 in particular, protection from creditors. That means that for the time being, Puerto Rico does not have to make payments on its bond debt, for a savings of about $3 billion to $3.5 billion a year.\n\nIn exchange for those extraordinary powers, Congress required the island to submit to a federal oversight board. The law gives the governor of Puerto Rico the right to develop the all-important fiscal plan, but the board must certify it. If it does not find the governor\u2019s fiscal plan credible, it has the authority to impose its own version.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Rossell\u00f3 has clashed repeatedly with the board, saying that as Puerto Rico\u2019s elected leader, he has the final say over economic policy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Period.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico has already been through the process once, certifying a fiscal plan in March 2017. But it soon became clear that the governor was not carrying out the parts he disagreed with, and the oversight board took him to court. Before the lawsuit could be adjudicated, Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck, leaving all financial planning in a shambles.\n\nThe two biggest flash points over the new plan now under review on Thursday appeared to be labor law reform and the cost of the pensions due to Puerto Rico\u2019s retired government workers. On many other elements of the fiscal plan \u2014 reducing health care spending and subsidies to cities; lowering tax rates while improving collections; and cutting red tape for businesses \u2014 the oversight board and the governor appear to be in agreement.\n\nBut board members said none of that would be enough unless Puerto Rico also softened labor laws that make it harder than anywhere else in the United States to lay off workers, which in turn makes employers on the island reluctant to hire people. Employers are also required to provide extensive paid vacations and annual holiday bonuses.\n\n\u201cObviously this is an extremely difficult issue politically,\u201d said one board member, Andrew Biggs, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut there\u2019s a risk of doing too little to increase Puerto Rico\u2019s labor force participation rate, which is one of the lowest in the world.\u201d The current rate of people either employed or looking for work in Puerto Rico is 40.6 percent, compared with 62.9 percent for the United States as a whole.\n\nOther board members noted that since the hurricane, young Puerto Ricans have been fleeing the island to look for work in the 50 states, even those with much less protective labor laws.\n\nBut the board does not have direct authority over the island\u2019s labor laws, only its fiscal policies. Amending the labor laws would require an act of the Puerto Rican Legislature, and Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said he would \u201cnot propose any bill that reduces vacation and/or sick leave, nor will we eliminate the Christmas bonus.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, fixing the government\u2019s insolvent pension system is a matter of fiscal policy. Retired government workers are counting on future monthly payments worth more than $50 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 and the pension funds already are essentially penniless. The money appears to have been spent on other things.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPuerto Rico is planning to revert to a pay-as-you-go pension plan, in which the government will pay retirees their monthly benefits directly from its general fund. That will severely strain the general fund, so the oversight board is calling for 10 percent average cuts in the pensions \u2014 people with the biggest pensions would get the biggest cuts.\n\n\u201cThe board wants to make sure they\u2019ll get their pensions, even though there\u2019s no money,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said at Thursday\u2019s meeting. But the pain of bankruptcy, she said, had to be fairly shared with all other government creditors, along with younger residents who rely on government services.\n\nMr. Portela, the chairman of Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, disagreed with that, calling governmental retirees \u201cthe most vulnerable of Puerto Rican society.\u201d He reminded the oversight board that teachers in Puerto Rico, like those in many of the 50 states, do not participate in Social Security.\n\nAnd the governor said he had no intention of cutting anybody\u2019s pension.\n\n\u201cOur position regarding pensions has always been crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow for a vulnerable sector of our population to be attacked.

But its prevalence means that most people have heard of it. Facebook might be even more valuable for individuals with very rare conditions and their families.\n\nEmily Wilkinson told me about her 5-year-old daughter, who was the first person given a diagnosis of Xia-Gibbs syndrome, caused by a genetic mutation, when she was 20 months old. Since then, about 70 people, mostly children, have been found to have the condition worldwide, and it is thought to lead to both physical and intellectual disabilities. Ms. Wilkinson says the Facebook group that parents and caregivers formed has been life-changing. Members are far-flung, and some of the parents have met in person. There were times when Ms. Wilkinson wanted to delete Facebook, or take a break, but she couldn\u2019t go through with it partly because of the group.\n\nRivka Einy-Biton has a 3-month-old son who was recently found to have megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by tissue overgrowth that affects brain development. There are under 300 reported cases of the condition. Joining a private Facebook group for those affected by the syndrome has helped her gain clarity and strength. Her fellow members share advice, resources and pictures of their own children. \u201cIn certain ways,\u201d she noted, \u201cthis group has been more helpful than many of the specialists we have seen.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Juliet Ross, has a 7-year-old son with eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic digestive disorder that requires him to use a feeding tube. She said the members of the Facebook group devoted to the condition refer to each other as \u201cour EoE family.\u201d Halloween is difficult for the children because restricted diets leave most, if not all, candy off limits, so the families join forces and mail each other cards instead.\n\nIt\u2019s useful, too, that they know the details about providing this specific type of medical care at home. \u201cWhen I have a feeding tube question in the middle of the night, it\u2019s really helpful that there might be another mom awake, maybe in Australia, who knows the answer,\u201d she noted. The kids themselves can get lonely as the only person in their circle with a feeding tube. It has become common for parents to reach out on Facebook, asking for pictures, so that their children can see that they are not alone.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just special-needs parents who find support on Facebook. There are lots of other important groups connecting there, including adults with disabilities. What should we all do?\n\nIt\u2019s not that I care about my personal privacy. I\u2019m boring.

Vouchers lite! Previously, these accounts could be used only for higher education. But the way that the relevant \u201cdeduction\u201d works hasn\u2019t changed. When you pay into these accounts in New York State, your state income-tax liability is reduced up to a limit of $5,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a couple. Once in the fund, your money grows federal- and state-tax-deferred; but you don\u2019t have to pay taxes when you take the money out, if it\u2019s for a qualified educational expense. (The details here, as with much tax law, get complicated, but this is the basic picture.) You may well be paying into one of these funds already for your child\u2019s college education and getting the maximum state-tax deduction. If so, this particular change in the tax law should not affect your income taxes very much.\n\nOf course, any money you take out in the next few years won\u2019t be available later for college expenses and won\u2019t have compounded for long. Still, the new federal law does encourage you to save for private school as well as college in one of these funds. If things remain as they are, the federal provision that increases the use of these funds threatens to reduce state income-tax revenue. Then again, a \u201cpreliminary report\u201d from New York\u2019s tax department suggests that K-12 payments may not be considered qualified educational expenses and that the state could recapture any associated tax benefits. And, as you\u2019re aware, this new use for 529 funds may do little to offset the loss to you that comes from no longer being able to deduct more than $10,000 in state property and income taxes from your federally taxable income.\n\nNone of that is ethics, though. My ethical view is you should take all the tax deductions you\u2019re legally entitled to. Many features of our tax system are ridiculous; many are the product of lobbying without much regard for the public good. But you don\u2019t have a duty to pay more than you are required to by law just because you and people like you are benefiting from bad policies, any more than you have the right to pay less than you\u2019re required to when you take a hit from bad policies. The right thing to aim for is tax reform that makes the system fairer. (We will all have our own views about whether the recent tax reforms did that. Count me a skeptic.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou\u2019re already helping to pay for New York\u2019s public schools through your taxes.

He added that data was kept around to eventually help brands serve targeted ads.\n\nBeth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201d\n\nDigging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.\n\nFacebook Retains More Data Than We Think\n\nWhen you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.\n\nOne surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone\u2019s address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook\u2019s messaging app, Messenger.\n\nThis was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.\n\nThis felt unnecessary, though Facebook holds on to your phone book partly to keep it synchronized with your contacts list on Messenger and to help find people who newly sign up for the messaging service. I opted to turn off synchronizing and deleted all my phone book entries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.\n\nFacebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.\n\nFacebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.\n\nBut what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?\n\nFacebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Ad Industry Has Eyes Everywhere\n\nWhat Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.\n\nLower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.\n\nFacebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBrands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:\n\n\u25a0 Buying information from a data provider like Acxiom, which has amassed one of the world\u2019s largest commercial databases on consumers. Brands can buy different types of customer data sets from a provider, like contact information for people who belong to a certain demographic, and take that information to Facebook to serve targeted ads, said Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Facebook announced that it was limiting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom.\n\n\u25a0 Using tracking technologies like web cookies and invisible pixels that load in your web browser to collect information about your browsing activities. There are many different trackers on the web, and Facebook offers 10 different trackers to help brands harvest your information, according to Ghostery, which offers privacy tools that block ads and trackers. The advertisers can take some pieces of data that they have collected with trackers and upload them into the Custom Audiences tool to serve ads to you on Facebook.\n\n\u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.\n\nThe upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.\n\nI tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech? Advice and tips on the technology changing how you live.

The data sets were exponentially larger than my Facebook data. For my personal email account alone, Google\u2019s archive of my data measured eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. By comparison, my Facebook data was about 650 megabytes, the equivalent of about 160 hours of music.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere was the biggest surprise in what Google collected on me: In a folder labeled Ads, Google kept a history of many news articles I had read, like a Newsweek story about Apple employees walking into glass walls and a New York Times story about the editor of our Modern Love column. I didn\u2019t click on ads for either of these stories, but the search giant logged them because the sites had loaded ads served by Google.\n\nIn another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.\n\nYet that offered little solace.

According to Forbes\u2019s annual tally, less than 12 percent of the world\u2019s billionaires are women, and almost three-quarters of that dismal stat inherited their fortunes.\n\nIf we want to close the wealth gap, we have to come at it from every angle. We have to stop paying women 80 cents to a man\u2019s dollar and women of color substantially less than that. We have to start raising girls the way we raise boys. A T. Rowe Price survey shows that in 2017, parents of only boys still save more and pay more for their sons\u2019 educations than parents who have only girls do.\n\nThis trickles down to the way we socialize kids \u2014 girls are expected to be caretakers, boys the ones who will deliver a return. If you want to create your own wealth, the confidence to take calculated risks is a necessary skill. Placing the needs of others above your own is not.\n\nI have always wrestled with what has been expected of me as a woman versus what I expect of myself. The conflicting messages of millennial womanhood: to be ambitious but never bossy, strong but skinny, honest but polite, supportive of my fellow sisters\u2019 success while the culture gets off on girl fights. Only in fiction have I been able to create women who aggressively seek money and power the way men seek money and power. Women who will kill to protect their measly slice of the pie.\n\nI often commiserate with other female authors about the catch-22 of publicity campaigns. We must talk ourselves up despite knowing that women who do so are disliked. Researchers have found that women are actually punished when they succeed at traditionally masculine endeavors. Meanwhile male authors on our panels monopolize the mic to the great delight of the crowd.\n\nSelf-promotion, for us, is a complicated dance with steps men will never have to learn. Oh, to be Daniel Mallory, who wrote \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d under the gender-ambiguous pen name A. J. Finn. Mr. Mallory told a reporter that his foreign sales \u2014 in 37 territories, at the time \u2014 \u201cmight be a record for a debut novel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a record. I knew it wasn\u2019t because my first book sold to 38.\n\nI used to hope someone else might trumpet my foreign sales for me, thinking only men got to be bumptious and beloved. Then Gillian Flynn baldly declared in Chicago magazine that the first page of her next novel is \u201cthe greatest first page that\u2019s ever been written.\u201d Reese Witherspoon told WSJ Magazine that if acting hadn\u2019t worked out, she\u2019d have become the premier surgeon and pediatric cardiologist at Vanderbilt University.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "Not all people want their lawsuit to play out in court. Sometimes victims of harassment and discrimination want privacy; sometimes corporations want to keep the ugly details of workplace disputes out of the public eye. For these cases, there is another avenue for obtaining justice: private arbitration. When the parties to a lawsuit decide to go to arbitration rather than a court of law, they meet with an arbitrator (usually a retired judge, and someone they both have decided to use), present their cases and then accept the judgment handed down. That is, ideally, how arbitration works.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality of how arbitration is used to settle workplace disputes is far from that ideal. In the tech industry, where I work, and where issues of harassment and discrimination remain rampant, nearly every company requires as a condition of employment that its employees sign away their constitutional right to sue it in a court of law and instead agree to take any claims against the company to private arbitration. They are also typically legally bound to keep silent about the illegal treatment they experienced and the entire arbitration process \u2014 a process that will be handled by an arbitrator who is chosen by the company and has financial incentive to keep the company happy. (Forced arbitration of this sort goes beyond issues of sexual harassment: A recent investigation by ProPublica, for example, showed that I.B.M. employees who experienced age discrimination were bound by forced arbitration and would never be able to sue the company in court.)\n\nForced arbitration has become a standard practice for a variety of reasons. The dominant view is that it helps manage long-term legal risk, ensuring that companies won\u2019t become embroiled in costly, drawn-out lawsuits. The examples of Uber and I.B.M. show that the opposite is true: Forced arbitration leads to long-term operating risk. Forcing legal disputes about discrimination, harassment and retaliation to go through secret arbitration proceedings hides the behavior and allows it to become culturally entrenched.\n\nBefore us lie three possible options for putting an end to this practice. The first is to leave it to individual companies and allow them to choose not to force their employees to sign away their constitutional rights. Microsoft has taken the lead on this and has stopped using arbitration agreements in cases of sexual harassment. As hopeful as this option might sound, leaving it up to individual companies is not likely to change the industry: The good companies will elect to ban arbitration agreements, while the bad companies will continue to use them and continue to mistreat their employees.\n\nThe second is to leave it to the Supreme Court, which will soon hand down a decision in the case of Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, a suit filed not over harassment but over unpaid overtime, but that nonetheless has the potential to reshape the way companies can use arbitration agreements, particularly when they are used to ban class-action lawsuits. But it\u2019s not clear how the court will rule \u2014 some analysis has suggested it is likely to rule in favor of employers \u2014 nor is it clear how this decision could shape forced arbitration for individuals.", "title": "Opinion | I Wrote the Uber Memo.

They rarely think of a black woman \u201cstripped naked and hung.\u201d Wells, however, was well aware that black women were victims of Southern mob violence and also targets of rape by white men.\n\nIn 1892, when mobs across the South murdered more than 200 African-American men and women, including one of Wells\u2019s closest friends, she began to systematically investigate lynchings. As I\u2019ve noted in my academic work, she soon discovered that few victims had even been accused of rape. In an editorial, she wrote that \u201cnobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women.\u201d In retaliation, a white mob destroyed her press and warned Wells, who was in New York at the time, not to come back or risk death.\n\nWells was not intimidated. Instead, she crossed the country lecturing on the evils of mob violence. She traveled to Britain, where she started an international crusade against lynching. She initiated one of the first public hearings to address both racial and sexual violence. Wells also sought to protect black women against rape by white men.\n\nFrom the start, she relied on the support of a network of black women. At a fund-raiser at Lyric Hall in New York, Wells described the group as \u201cthe greatest demonstration ever attempted by race women for one of their own number.\u201d The proceeds from the event allowed her to publish \u201cSouthern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases,\u201d the first anti-lynching pamphlet.\n\nIn \u201cSouthern Horrors,\u201d Wells made clear that white men perpetrated sexual violence against black women, while black men were brutalized by white mobs for having consensual sex with white women. And by showing that only about 30 percent of the black victims of lynch mobs had actually been accused of rape, Wells challenged the idea that lynchings resulted from it.", "title": "Opinion | Ida B.

Sabonis\u2019s rights were included in a draft-night trade in 2016 that sent him and Oladipo, along with Ersan Ilyasova, from the Orlando Magic to the Thunder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a special bond, man,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cHe\u2019s like my little big brother. I can talk to him about anything, and he can talk to me about anything.\u201d\n\nThe Pacers acquired them last summer when Paul George, a five-time All-Star who had spent his entire career with the team, made it clear that he wanted out of Indiana. Given George\u2019s trade demand, the Pacers did not have a ton of leverage. They eventually struck a deal with the Thunder, who agreed to trade Oladipo and Sabonis for George. No player was more synonymous with the franchise. Now, he was gone.\n\nAt the time, words like \u201cfleeced\u201d and \u201cpathetic\u201d were used in various reports to describe the transaction.

The head of the Lithuanian basketball federation happens to be his father, Arvydas Sabonis, the Hall of Fame center.\n\n\u201cTo miss that really hurt,\u201d Domantas Sabonis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for the country.

Sabonis found Bayno waiting for him at the team\u2019s practice facility with those pads, which he used to batter Sabonis on drives to the basket. Bayno was trying to teach Sabonis to use his shoulder to initiate contact and knock his defenders off-balance.\n\nBy December, Bayno was challenging Sabonis to become \u201cthe best passing big man\u201d in the league. Bayno could sense that Sabonis had rare vision and touch for a player his size. More growth is ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on finding that balance between shooting when he\u2019s open and kicking it out when he draws a crowd,\u201d Bayno said. \u201cBecause there are times where he\u2019ll attack and have three guys on him, and that\u2019s the only time when he has a tough time making those decisions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSabonis does not shy away from physical play.

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "Modern-day tastemakers, unlike their forebears, shower love on comics and graphic novels without a hint of condescension. This is true even of works intended mainly for children, a category that includes \u2014 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 most of the superhero sagas that dominate pop culture\u2019s most lucrative precincts. I\u2019m not complaining, by the way (I love comics too), just observing. But picture books are another story. Even the genius likes of Beatrix Potter and Maurice Sendak are shunted off to the critical equivalent of the Thanksgiving kids\u2019 table, smiled at but not often engaged with. Yet the best picture books, far from being baby food, display a pictorial sophistication that puts many graphic novels to shame; think of them as visual haiku, an art form of juxtaposition and implication, bright colors notwithstanding. And here are three examples to prove the point \u2014 books full of surface delight that also reward close reading. Kids might love them, but I\u2019m guessing all three will resonate even more with grown-ups.\n\nStanding in the outfield and waiting to catch a high fly ball is among the more agonizing but ubiquitous rituals of American childhood: not quite as dire as doctors\u2019 shots or puberty, but still bad. (That anyone sticks with baseball long enough to get good at it is a tribute to either the human spirit or masochism.) In I GOT IT! (Clarion Books/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), David Wiesner slows time down and finds a world of drama in those five or so hellish seconds between ball leaving bat and settling \u2014 or not \u2014 into mitt. Surely even capable athletes will relate to the interplay between body and mind, muscle and emotion, which \u201cI Got It!\u201d captures with beauty, fluidity, wit and suspense.\n\nWiesner is the only living three-time winner of the Caldecott Medal \u2014 for \u201cTuesday\u201d (1991), \u201cThe Three Pigs\u201d (2001) and \u201cFlotsam\u201d (2006). Like most of his books, \u201cI Got It!\u201d is wordless, apart from the title phrase, which appears first as aspirational shout and once again, many pages later, as triumphant cry. (I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler, but Wiesner is no Charles Schulz.) The hero is a boy who, when we first see him, is standing on the wrong side of a backstop fence, longing to join a sandlot game. He looks to be a year or two younger than the rest of the kids; a team captain banishes him to the farther reaches of the field, somewhere around Pluto\u2019s orbit, where he can presumably do no harm. But the inevitable ball is hit his way, and Wiesner\u2019s illustrations begin to shift subtly between actual playing field and interior landscape. In the boy\u2019s mind, as he races to make the catch, he suffers several catastrophic failures. Then, as teammates also converge on the ball, he takes flight in a rush of surreal images \u2014 focus emerging amid fear and distraction.", "title": "If Graphic Novels Are Hip for Adults, Why Not Picture Books?", "authors": []}

The White House and Republicans seized on Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip as another reason for the Senate to confirm him, while Democrats said he had misled them by failing to disclose his mission, even in private conversations.\n\nBut the visit underlines the confidence that Mr. Trump has developed in Mr. Pompeo, a former Tea Party congressman who has emerged as one of the president\u2019s closest advisers \u2014 a stark contrast to Rex W. Tillerson, whom Mr. Trump fired as secretary of state days after he accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet.\n\nIt also underlines Mr. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach to one of the riskiest diplomatic gambits of his presidency. However trusted by the president, Mr. Pompeo is hardly a traditional emissary. He is not yet the nation\u2019s chief diplomat but a lame duck as the nation\u2019s spymaster.\n\nMr. Pompeo met with Mr. Kim on Easter Sunday, a senior official said, bringing along several aides from the C.I.A. \u2014 but nobody from the State Department or the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome former administration officials expressed surprise that he returned from Pyongyang with no visible concessions, like the release of the three Americans detained in North Korea. Mr. Pompeo raised the issue, another official said, adding that the White House would continue to push for their release.\n\nIn 2014, James R. Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, traveled secretly to North Korea to negotiate the release of two Americans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller. Three Korean-Americans \u2014 Kim Dong-chul, Kim Sang-duk and Kim Hak-song \u2014 are currently being held on charges of espionage and committing hostile acts toward the North Korean state.\n\nThe administration also has not agreed on a date for the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, which officials said pointed to problems in settling on a site for the encounter. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that the White House was looking at five potential locations.\n\nThe White House has begun narrowing the list of options, a senior official said, eliminating sites like Pyongyang and the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, which could pose an optics problem for Mr. Trump. Meeting somewhere in the United States remains a possibility, though that could raise similar issues for Mr. Kim.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe administration is studying several third countries \u2014 Singapore and Vietnam, in Asia; Sweden and Switzerland, in Europe \u2014 though all are far from North Korea, posing a challenge to Mr. Kim\u2019s fleet of rickety aircraft.

He has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.\n\nHe also has been in close touch with the director of South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile a meeting between the leaders would be one of the boldest diplomatic gambles in recent years, it was orchestrated largely by the intelligence services of the three countries.\n\nOfficials said Mr. Suh laid the groundwork for Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation in negotiations and a subsequent meeting in Pyongyang with Kim Yong-chol, a powerful general who leads inter-Korean relations and used to run North Korea\u2019s intelligence service.\n\nMr. Suh was one of two South Korean envoys who visited the White House to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang \u2014 which led to the president\u2019s impromptu decision to accept Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation.\n\nFor Mr. Pompeo, who now has an office at the State Department, the choice to use the intelligence channel was mostly a convenience \u2014 allowing him to be involved in the planning as he awaited his move to the department.\n\nStill, some officials expressed concern that the C.I.A. had taken the lead in orchestrating a leader-to-leader meeting \u2014 work that would normally fall to the State Department. The intelligence officials on the North Korean side, they said, are shadowy figures, not least Kim Yong-chol himself, who is accused of masterminding a torpedo attack that sank a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, killing 46 sailors.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s role in North Korea dwindled after Mr. Trump publicly split with Mr. Tillerson over his efforts to open a diplomatic channel to the North, initially to obtain the release of the three Americans but also to set the stage for a broader negotiation.\n\nIn October, while Mr. Tillerson was in Beijing, Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cI told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...\u201d\n\nThe State Department recently lost its chief North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, who retired from the Foreign Service, in part because of his frustration with his agency\u2019s diminished role.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe timing of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure, officials said, was not coincidental.

The Nazis killed about six million Jews; Japanese invaders massacred millions of Chinese; European settlers in the Americas enslaved millions of Africans; the list goes on. But the striking thing about Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union, as the Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen observes in her new book, \u201cNever Remember,\u201d is that \u201cRussians exerted the force of state terror against themselves. \u2026 The millions who died anonymously in the Gulag were not necessarily members of ethnic or religious minorities, or even homosexuals: The population of the camps largely corresponded to the population of the country.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough at times the dictator\u2019s venom did target particular groups, like Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and, at the very end of his life, Jews, this is largely true.

In 1991, I lived in Russia for five months, working on a book about how Soviets were coming to terms with the Stalin era. There was still some exhilaration in the air at how, under Mikhail Gorbachev, you could now discuss and explore things that had been off limits for some 70 years. I met dozens of researchers studying that dark era, including an imaginative high school history teacher who staged a mock trial of Stalin in his class and people who were digging up mass graves (at one in Siberia I could see the bullet hole in each earth-stained skull). Activists in Moscow put on an evening of poetry and music performed by, or in honor of, Gulag survivors. Museums displayed prison camp artifacts. In the Kolyma region of Russia\u2019s far northeast I visited the most desolate place I have ever seen, Butugychag, a barren, rocky valley streaked with snow even in June, where thousands of prisoners had been worked to death mining tin and uranium, their bodies thrown down unused mine shafts. But the man with me from the Memorial Society, a human rights group, eagerly talked about how places like this could be turned into remembrance sites with lessons for today, as has happened at Auschwitz and other Nazi death camps.\n\nGessen and Misha Friedman, who took the grainy, haunting photographs for this book, also visited Butugychag, but found no memorials there. Virtually the only place in Russia where this has happened is a former labor camp outside of Perm, in the Urals, carefully restored over some years. But then something occurred that was never anticipated. Under Putin \u2014 whose motto might as well be \u201cMake Russia Great Again\u201d \u2014 Stalin\u2019s rule is now remembered as a time of glory and order. Scores of new books and films portray the era in glowing colors, and vintage secret police uniforms are on sale. The husband-and-wife team who spearheaded the restoration at Perm lost their jobs, and the rebuilt camp has now become a site of pilgrimage for those who want to celebrate the old days. It is a grim reminder that once again, as in the 1930s, all over the world authoritarian strongmen are riding high.", "title": "Illuminating the Dark World of the Soviet Gulag, in Photos and Text", "authors": ["Adam Hochschild", "Masha Gessen", "Misha Friedman"]}

If we are lucky, they tender surprisingly creative acts and gifts.\n\nImaginative caregiving is welcome because of the debilitation of prolonged treatment but also because of the barrage of clich\u00e9d responses patients receive from chance acquaintances. There I am, minding my own business in the drugstore, when someone pops up: \u201cMy aunt had your kind of cancer and died in two months.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t look sick!\u201d \u201cDid you eat red meat?\u201d \u201cThe good Lord never gives us more than we can bear.\u201d Those of us with chronic disease learn to block out this type of noise.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the process of sidelining inane comments, though, we may exacerbate the loneliness of the long-distance cancer patient, for dealing with the disease can be an isolating business. Colleagues in social situations can be tongue-tied about my condition, afraid of saying the wrong thing or respectful of my privacy. At a reception, I retreat into myself because of an unspeakable physical problem: a rash, a swelling, a hidden bag, enervating but boring fatigue, invisible neuropathies or joint pain. I feel further quarantined by an overwhelming consciousness of impending mortality that healthy men and women often cannot comprehend or desperately want to flee.\n\nWhile conversations rarely penetrate the bell jar of my self-containment, inventive forms of caregiving do. Over the years, relatives and friends have scoured my refrigerator, weeded my closet, shaved my head, emailed jokes, brought over pets, read aloud a cherished book, served as my personal grocery shopper and taken me to concerts. Others have given me a gentle yoga session, a shell from Sanibel Island, a potboiler, an outrageous wig, a microwaveable hot pad, and (unexpectedly effective) battery-operated socks.\n\nPhoto\n\nWit is one of the most treasured characteristics of thoughtful caregiving, and Bob Carey\u2019s Tutu Project offers a generous dose of it. After his wife, Linda, began dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis, Mr. Carey, a commercial photographer, began taking photographs of himself wearing only a pink tutu in public places. He wanted to make her laugh. Since the images also amused the other patients she met in the hospital, they decided to publish them as a coffee-table book called \u201cBallerina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth photographer and subject, Mr. Carey poses in a variety of landmark settings: on the Brooklyn Bridge, at the Little Grand Canyon in Utah, on Newport Beach, Calif., at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. The pictures suggest that those dealing with cancer take it with them wherever they go.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe juxtaposition of our idea of the stereotypically sleek ballerina and Mr. Carey\u2019s burly, hairy body is playful, but the images simultaneously convey his isolation and vulnerability. Usually solo, he appears at a distance in vast spaces that dwarf him, decked out in a flimsy costume that exposes his fleshiness and that might put him at risk.

But the tension peaked when the pipeline\u2019s owner, Kinder Morgan of Houston, said last weekend that it is suspending all nonessential spending on the program.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company gave British Columbia until the end of May to end its attempts to delay or block the project. If not, the company said it would cancel its plan to add a second pipeline along aroute that opened in 1953.\n\nTo try to resolve the standoff, Mr. Trudeau has summoned Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, and John Horgan, her counterpart in British Columbia, to Ottawa for talks on Sunday.\n\nGiven the intransigence of both sides, even Mr. Trudeau\u2019s top officials are downplaying the idea that the conversation will end the battle. But it may provide a glimpse of how Mr. Trudeau intends to grapple with an issue in which any resolution will inevitably alienate some voters, and on which there isn\u2019t a clear national consensus.\n\n\u201cCanadians are quite divided,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. \u201cSo much of this debate is rural versus urban Canada.\u201d\n\nLike the Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf Coast of the United States, which was quashed by President Barack Obama and revived by Mr. Trump, the expansion of the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline is the latest attempt by the oil sands industry to push more of its product out to market. The pipelines have not expanded at the same rate as output from the oil sands, leaving many producers relying on expensive rail shipments to get their product to the United States, which currently buys almost all of Canada\u2019s oil and gas exports.\n\nTankers filled by the current Kinder Morgan pipeline now sail to refineries on the West Coast of the United States. The extra capacity from an expansion could, in theory, allow oil sands companies to also begin shipping to Asian markets where demand for oil is growing, said Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist at the University of Alberta.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Notley, and her left-of-center New Democratic Party, surprised the Canadian political world in 2015 by bringing four and a half decades of Progressive Conservative rule to an end in Alberta. While she vowed in her campaign to take on the big oil interests in the province, politically she has no choice but to be a booster of the pipeline. Polls show that Albertans overwhelmingly want the expansion to go ahead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo defend the expansion, the premier has shown a willingness to get tough with her provincial neighbor to the west. Earlier this year, Ms. Notley briefly banned imports of wine from British Columbia.\n\nAnd unless the meeting Sunday changes her mind, Ms. Notley\u2019s government is expected to introduce legislation next week that will give it the ability to restrict oil and gas shipments to British Columbia, and so driving up prices in the province.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Officials in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet have suggested that the federal government might support such a plan.\n\nFor Mr. Horgan in British Columbia, the political calculus surrounding the pipeline expansion was more complex. The project is widely opposed in the areas around Vancouver and Victoria, the provincial capital, according to Ms. Kurl, the pollster. But support is strong for it elsewhere in the province, where resource industries are big employers.\n\nPhoto\n\nPerhaps tipping the scale in his decision to try to block the project is that Mr. Horgan, also a member of the New Democratic Party, relies on the support of three Green Party members to pass legislation. That party, like many environmental groups, argues that Canada should not be building oil pipelines while it is attempting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSo Mr. Horgan plans to ask a court to determine if British Columbia can use local permits and provincial environmental laws to block the pipeline.\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s government has cited several decisions, including some from the Supreme Court, that it contends give Ottawa complete authority over interprovincial pipelines. But it appears that the federal government can do nothing to stop Mr. Horgan from going to court. Any judicial review could at least delay the project.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sparring between the two premiers may prove to be the least of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s worries in the pipeline fight, as he tries to balance Canada\u2019s economic dependence on the energy industry with his climate change commitments.\n\nEnvironmental groups and some indigenous groups have vowed to stop the pipeline expansion through widespread civil disobedience. Those arrested already for breaking court orders to keep back from Kinder Morgan property include Elizabeth May, the leader of the federal Green Party.\n\nMany environmental groups are using the pipeline expansion as a proxy in the fight against the oil sands, a source of fossil fuels that they condemn as excessively polluting.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, we would like to see the federal government recognizing that it made an egregious mistake in approving this pipeline,\u201d said Cam Fenton, a Canada strategy manager for 350.org, a nonprofit that opposes new fossil fuel projects. \u201cAt the end of the day polls change, science doesn\u2019t.

{"date": "2018-04-26 00:00:00", "text": "WADE IN THE WATER\n\nPoems\n\nBy Tracy K. Smith\n\n83 pp. Graywolf Press. $24.\n\nTracy K. Smith\u2019s previous collection of poems, \u201cLife on Mars,\u201d was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2012. With an ambition and range unequaled among her contemporaries, that book more than realized the promise of two earlier, somewhat more uneven volumes, \u201cThe Body\u2019s Question\u201d (2003) and \u201cDuende\u201d (2007), both of which also contained some stunningly beautiful poems. There has been quite a bit of good poetry written over the last 20 years in this country, and Smith \u2014 who since June 2017 has also served as the United States poet laureate \u2014 has produced among the most original of it.\n\nExpectations are high, in other words, for her new collection, \u201cWade in the Water.\u201d\n\nSmith was born in Falmouth, Mass., and grew up in Fairfield, Calif., a small city midway between San Francisco and Sacramento. She was the youngest of five children. Her father grew up in Alabama and escaped the segregated South by enlisting in the Air Force. Her mother was a seriously religious person who went to church regularly and read the Bible every day. After Smith\u2019s father retired from the military, he went to work as an optical engineer on the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA, which after its launch in 1990 helped scientists pin down the age of the universe and discover the so-called dark energy that counters gravity and keeps galaxies from colliding.\n\nImage\n\nReading the poems in \u201cLife on Mars\u201d \u2014 with titles like \u201cThe Universe Is a House Party,\u201d \u201cEverything That Ever Was,\u201d \u201cMy God, It\u2019s Full of Stars,\u201d \u201cThe Universe as Primal Scream\u201d and so on \u2014 one can\u2019t help being reminded of the father who spent years looking at the stars; in that light, his daughter\u2019s book is both an extended conversation with him and an elegy. \u201cAwe\u201d was Emily Dickinson\u2019s favorite word. She fretted about being a speck on a ball floating in darkness as much as the Smith of \u201cLife on Mars\u201d does. They both savor the thrill and terror of thinking about this mystery we are all in some way a part of, this mystery we call by different names without ever reducing the mystery, because it\u2019s bigger than language and has no need of our words. This is how Smith sees it, in a poem from \u201cLife on Mars\u201d called \u201cIt & Co.\u201d:\n\nWe are a part of It. Not guests.\n\nIs It us, or what contains us?\n\nHow can It be anything but an idea,\n\nSomething teetering on the spine\n\nOf the number i? It is elegant\n\nBut coy. It avoids the blunt ends\n\nOf our fingers as we point. We\n\nHave gone looking for It everywhere:\n\nIn Bibles and bandwidth, blooming\n\nLike a wound from the ocean floor.\n\nStill, It resists the matter of false vs. real.\n\nUnconvinced by our zeal, It is un-\n\nAppeasable. It is like some novels:\n\nVast and unreadable.\n\nIn her very good new book, Smith\u2019s concerns are more earthbound. Numerous poems in the collection are based on the letters and statements of African-Americans who served as soldiers in the Civil War and their wives, widows, parents and children, as well as correspondence between members of a white family regarding the sale of their various slaves. Smith shortens the letters, preserves the original spelling and punctuation, then titles and resets them so they look like poems. Here is one called \u201cI Will Tell You the Truth About This, I Will Tell You All About It\u201d:\n\nCarlisles, Pa. Nov 21 1864 Mr abarham lincon\n\nI wont to knw sir if you please\n\nwhether I can have my son relest\n\nfrom the arme he is all the subport\n\nI have now his father is Dead\n\nand his brother that wase all\n\nthe help I had he has bean wonded\n\ntwise he has not had nothing to send\n\nme yet\n\nnow I am old and my head is blossaming\n\nfor the grave and if you do I hope\n\nthe lord will bless you and me\n\ntha say that you will simpethise\n\nwithe the poor he be long to the\n\neight rigmat colard troops\n\nhe is a sarjent\n\nmart welcom is his name\n\nWhat I have always liked about Smith\u2019s poetry is her interest in other people\u2019s lives. The lone self has been the sacred cow of lyric poetry since the ancient Greeks, and there\u2019s no way to sever that link permanently, but a vacation now and then from self-absorption to look around and see what the rest of the human race has been up to can do wonders to one\u2019s poetry. Of course, mostly they\u2019ve been up to no good \u2014 \u201cThe worst in us having taken over / And broken the rest utterly down,\u201d as Smith says here in a poem called \u201cAn Old Story.\u201d\n\nSmith once told an interviewer that when she had finished writing her first book, she felt she had gotten off her chest all she had to say and was tired of herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to let go of the first person,\u201d she told herself. Of course, she didn\u2019t. She turned to photography for about a year during an extended writer\u2019s block, and when she did get back into writing, everything felt different. She realized that vivid imagery could go far toward condensing a poem\u2019s narrative and conveying feelings. In her last two books we see the results of that lesson. The poems in \u201cWade in the Water\u201d are full of memorable images nimbly put together by Smith\u2019s exquisite sense of timing and her feel for the kind of language appropriate to the poem.", "title": "In Her New Work, a Public Poet Balances the Personal and Political", "authors": []}

The agency had tried to delay the revisions for six years.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that Mr. Trump felt that Mr. Pruitt had done a satisfactory job at the EPA. Her comments suggested that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s work checking off items on the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 including rolling back a large number of environmental protections \u2014 may weigh heavily as a counterbalance to the ethics questions related to his travel expenses, management practices and his rental of a living space from the wife of a prominent lobbyist.\n\nDescribing Mr. Trump\u2019s view of Mr. Pruitt, she said: \u201cHe likes the work product.\u201d\n\nLiz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, disputed the criticisms of the agency\u2019s work. \u201cE.P.A. does its due diligence, consults with O.M.B. and other federal agencies to ensure that its work is legally defensible,\u201d she said in an email, referring to the Office of Management and Budget, the office that coordinates and evaluates policy across the executive branch.\n\nOne of the chief examples cited by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s critics came this week when the E.P.A. filed its legal justification for what is arguably the largest rollback of an environmental rule in the Trump administration: the proposed undoing of an Obama-era regulation aimed at cutting pollution of planet-warming greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes.\n\nMr. Pruitt made his case for the rollback in a 38-page document filed on Tuesday that, experts say, was devoid of the kind of supporting legal, scientific and technical data that courts have shown they expect to see when considering challenges to regulatory changes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible lack of numbers,\u201d said James McCargar, a former senior policy analyst at the E.P.A. who worked on vehicle emissions programs and remains in close touch with career staffers who work on those programs. \u201cIf this gets challenged in court, I just don\u2019t see how they provide anything that gives a technical justification to undo the rule.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rules Mr. Pruitt is targeting would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of passenger vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Automakers have argued the rule is onerous, forcing them to invest heavily in building hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nAs part of the process, Mr. Pruitt filed the 38-page document, which is meant to supply the government\u2019s legal justification for rolling back the rule. About half the document consists of quotations from automakers laying out their objections to the rule. By comparison, the Obama administration\u2019s 1,217-page document justifying its implementation of the regulation included technical, scientific and economic analyses justifying the rule.\n\nExperts in environmental policy said the lack of analytical arguments in this week\u2019s E.P.A. filing surprised them. \u201cThis document is unprecedented,\u201d said Mr. McCargar, the former E.P.A. senior policy analyst. \u201cThe E.P.A. has just never done anything like this.\u201d\n\nJohn M. DeCicco, a professor of engineering and public policy at the University of Michigan Energy Institute, said the filing was a departure from the practices of previous Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\n\u201cA president or an administrator or somebody can\u2019t just say, \u2018I\u2019m going to change the rule,\u2019 without justifying it very, very carefully,\u201d Mr. DeCicco said. \u201cAs a scientist who\u2019s worked on these issues, I\u2019m saying, where are the numbers? Where\u2019s the data?\u201d\n\nMost of the document consists of arguments quoting directly from public comments made by automaker lobbyists, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Global Automakers, that the pollution rules will be unduly burdensome on the auto industry, as well as public comments from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi.\n\nWhile it does include arguments opposing the regulatory rollback from groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the state of California, it does not contain what environmental experts say is the critical element of a legally strong justification for changing an E.P.A. regulation: Technical analysis of both sides of the argument leading to a conclusion aimed at persuading a judge that the change is defensible.\n\nSeth Michaels, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggested that, in its reuse of arguments by the automakers\u2019 lobby, the emissions-rollback document echoed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s modus operandi when he was the Oklahoma Attorney General.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of the 2011 letter Scott Pruitt sent as Oklahoma AG to the E.P.A., in which he took a letter drafted by lawyers for Devon Energy and stuck his name on it with minimal edits,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.\n\nA 2014 investigation by The Times found that lobbyists for Devon Energy, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send to the E.P.A., the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and President Obama, outlining the economic hardship of various environmental rules.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, Mr. Pruitt filed suit against the E.P.A. 14 times, and lost almost all of the cases.\n\nMost were filed in conjunction with the Republican attorneys general of a dozen or more other states, making it difficult to know precisely which legal arguments his office contributed, legal experts said. Mr. Pruitt frequently took a lead role in the cases.\n\nIn the end, \u201ca lot of those arguments were losers,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Revesz noted a case brought by the group against President Obama\u2019s signature climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan, which Mr. Pruitt is now working to overturn from within the E.P.A. The lawsuit challenged a draft proposal of the regulation, which was an unprecedented move that a federal court quickly struck down, saying that they could not legally challenge a draft.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the attorneys general, including Mr. Pruitt, garnered media attention for the case, \u201cThe argument they had was ludicrous,\u201d Mr. Revesz said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group did, however, score one major victory: After the Obama administration issued its final version of the Clean Power Plan, it successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to temporarily halt implementation of the rule.\n\nSince taking the helm of E.P.A., Mr. Pruitt has barnstormed the country, meeting with farmers, coal miners and local leaders and promising an end to his predecessor\u2019s regulatory approach. He also has favored closed-door policy speeches to conservative think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation, to roll out policy initiatives.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation was the venue Mr. Pruitt chose this year to say that he would make changes to how scientific studies are considered at the agency. Both critics and supporters of Mr. Pruitt said that, by making the proposal in a political fashion rather than changing the rules in a quieter but potentially more lasting way means that changes like these are more vulnerable to being undone by a future administration.\n\nEnvironmental groups have welcomed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s court losses. Joanne Spalding, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club, said she was pleased by what she called \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201ccareless\u201d E.P.A. legal work. \u201cIt\u2019s fine with us,\u201d she said. \u201cDo a bad job repealing these things, because then we get to go to court and win.\u201d\n\nThomas J. Pyle, a supporter of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that promotes fossil fuels, described that as spin. \u201cThe environmental left portrays Scott Pruitt as a devil incarnate in their fund-raising solicitations, yet brag about how ineffective he is in dismantling Obama\u2019s climate rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d\n\nStill, some conservatives said they were worried that Mr. Pruitt was more interested in media attention than policy and feared more legal losses. \u201cIf the goal is to generate temporary relief and to make a splash, then what they\u2019re doing is terrifically fine,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler, director of the Center for Business Law & Regulation at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.\n\nBut if the Trump administration wants to permanently change the regulatory environment for business, he said, the E.P.A. cannot take such a \u201cquick and dirty approach\u201d to unraveling regulations. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious that two, three years down the road there\u2019s going to be much to show for all the fireworks we\u2019re getting now,\u201d Mr. Adler said.", "title": "In His Haste to Roll Back Rules, Scott Pruitt, E.P.A.

A strong student, he won a scholarship from the Malian government to attend college abroad.\n\nHe had never been anywhere other than the neighboring country of Senegal.

It would cost the state $5.23 billion \u2014 about $758 each for 6.9 million farmers. Another key demand was from farmers from the indigenous tribal communities who have for generations cultivated forest lands that are not officially vested in their names. They seek the implementation of India\u2019s Forest Rights Act of 2006, which could confer them title deeds to those lands.\n\nAnd the marchers, like all farmers across India, demanded minimum support prices for their produce at levels that governments have long promised. Prices received by farmers have seen repeated collapses. Dependence on the monsoon has been joined by an even sharper vulnerability to a rigged market. A severe water crisis, often driven more by unequal access than by poor rainfall, has further damaged agriculture.\n\nThe census in 2011 showed that for the first time since Indian independence in 1947, urban India added more people to its population than rural India did. Millions have left their villages for other villages, small towns and cities in search of jobs that are not there. As many male farmers moved out of their villages, the burdens of female farmers rose in ways numbers cannot capture. Between 1995 and 2015, the National Crime Records Bureau logged over 300,000 farmer suicides.\n\nSuccessive governments have connived at and hastened the corporate hijacking of Indian agriculture, privileging the profits of a few over countless livelihoods. Millions of poor rural Indians whose transactions are almost entirely in cash were badly hurt after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2016 banned two bills that account for a vast majority of all currency in circulation and decided to introduce new bills. The expansion of existing bans on cow slaughter wrecked the livelihoods of millions of farmers who bought and sold cattle.\n\nRural India\u2019s deepening distress unfolds against the canvas of policy-driven inequality over the past two decades.

The fragrance Sulawesi is named for the Indonesian island where Mr. Gandhi buys patchouli, for example, while Moir\u00e9 highlights a synthetic ingredient engineered in a laboratory to resemble the smell of leather.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the fragrance line is full of subtle allusions to Indian scents, places and history. Mr. Gandhi said the aim of his branding and marketing was to conjure nostalgia for bygone eras and local fragrance traditions. Calicut, for example, highlights black pepper and uses the former name of the southern Indian city of Kozhikode, while Madurai Talkies pays homage to jasmine from around the southern city of Madurai.\n\n(And \u201ctalkies\u201d was slang for \u201ctalking pictures,\u201d the term used in the 1920s for the first movies with sound. \u201cIt\u2019s a very romantic fragrance,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said, \u201cand Indian movies, at least in the past, were all about romance.\u201d)\n\nThe nostalgic theme is enhanced by the collages printed inside the perfume boxes, juxtaposing images of the ingredients with those of old Mumbai buildings. And the glass perfume bottles are made in the shape of a matka, a jug commonly used in Indian villages to store water.\n\nYet, Mr. Gandhi said, he tried to avoid the \u201ckitschy, traditional stereotype of what Western people have about India,\u201d in part by using a minimalist design on the outside of the boxes \u2014 a look that matches the aesthetic of his sleek office in central Mumbai.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe also commissioned a modern twist on chai, a milky sweet tea ubiquitous in India.

He gave them general guidance on which ingredients to highlight, he said, but more creative license than they normally receive from major perfume brands and fragrance houses.\n\nHe said the overall idea was to make the final creations \u201cpolarizing enough for people to remember,\u201d and that Chai Musk, what he called the line\u2019s most \u201cout there\u201d fragrance, was suggested by a Paris perfumer who had traveled widely in India and wanted to celebrate a citrusy chai she once tasted in Mumbai.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMaybe a lot of brands would have been like, \u2018No, we don\u2019t want anything to do with that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gandhi said over chai in his office. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s go ahead \u2014 why don\u2019t we explore that direction?\u2019 So it was really fun for them because they had a chance to really go wild.\u201d\n\nMaurice Roucel, a master perfumer in France who has created fragrances for major luxury brands (but not Bombay Perfumery), said he was impressed by the quality of the label\u2019s fragrances and that they certainly could appeal to consumers in Europe, the United States and South America.\n\n\u201cPerhaps not France,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause in France we are very picky.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Gandhi plans eventually to introduce his perfumes in Europe and the United States, for now his primary market is young, fashion-forward Indians who, he said, are embracing other homegrown independent labels in clothing, food, music and design.\n\n\u201cWhen we were younger there was this notion that all things luxury were better only if they were European, but now it\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said, referring to his own generation of Indian consumers. \u201cMost young people now give homegrown brands a chance \u2014 as long as they ensure the quality is there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, he added, he sees his competition as independent foreign perfume labels, not Indian ones. As for the most popular ones in India now, he listed Amouage, a fragrance company based in Oman; the Dutch brand Nasomatto; Tom Ford; and Jo Malone London as among the top choices.\n\nHe declined to provide sales figures, but said Bombay Perfumery was adding nearly one new boutique a month and making 40 percent of its sales online, mostly to clients in India.\n\nTo help grow a domestic fan base, the label holds occasional events at cafes, boutiques and art galleries in major Indian cities. Mr. Gandhi said the goal was to encourage leaders in various creative fields to use fragrance as a muse for artistic projects.\n\nMs. Washington, for example, created an experiential installation that featured a wall covered with drawings of windows. A collection of about 200 stamps, some of which were meant to represent Bombay Perfumery fragrances, sat on a nearby table, and visitors were encouraged to select stamps that reflected their impressions of Mumbai\u2019s \u201csmell and vibe\u201d and use them on the wall.\n\nAnother event was a storytelling workshop geared to olfactory memories. Mr. Gandhi said some participants came away saying that it helped them remember their childhoods \u2014 an aquatic scent, for example, triggered a distant memory of the Goa seaside.\n\nHe said the events were primarily brand-building exercises.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hard sell,\u201d an audience member told him after the storytelling workshop. \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying to sell me perfume.\u201d", "title": "In India, Perfumes That Smell \u2018Like Home\u2019", "authors": ["Mike Ives"]}
{"date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "text": "Winning in all three of these states has taken on added urgency after the unanticipated retirements of Republican senators in Tennessee, Arizona and Mississippi left open seats that could suddenly be competitive.\n\nIn Indiana, Representative Todd Rokita started airing a television ad this week that labeled one of his opponents, Representative Luke Messer, a \u201cNever Trump lobbyist\u201d and the other, Mike Braun, a business executive, as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. His slogan: \u201cDefeat the Elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate three-way race,\u201d said John Hammond, a lawyer and member of the Republican National Committee from Indiana, \u201cand everybody will probably go right up to the line with rhetoric and negative message. It\u2019s happening and it\u2019s intensifying.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAll the opposition research will have been done for Joe Donnelly at that point.\u201d\n\nMr. Rokita said he had no concerns that the attacks would help the incumbent Democrat. \u201cI think this primary is very cleansing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want voters to know about these two guys. And I want them to know about me.\u201d\n\nReferring to two previous Republican presidential candidates, John R. Kasich and Mitt Romney, Mr. Rokita added: \u201cMesser at this point is like all losing candidates, like Kasich or Romney, \u2018if you beat up on me, we are all going to lose.\u2019 Absolutely wrong. I am not waiting for Joe Donnelly to stick a knife in Luke Messer or Mike Braun in November. I am getting it all out now. Because Donnelly will stick in a knife in them.\u201d\n\nThat kind of language has prompted concern among some of the state\u2019s most influential Republicans.\n\nMr. Grand, who supports Mr. Messer, was particularly critical of Mr. Rokita trying to claim a populist mantle by deriding so-called elites. Mr. Rokita\u2019s \u201celites\u201d are something else to Mr. Grand: \u201cPeople that know what\u2019s good for the Republican Party, yes, longstanding Republicans, yes. People who know how to elect Republican candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr,\u201d he asked, does Mr. Rokita \u201cwant to go back to the group that gave us Mourdock?\u201d\n\nThat was a reference to Richard E. Mourdock, a candidate whose backing from Tea Party groups and national conservative organizations six years ago led to the defeat of a longtime incumbent Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar, in the Indiana primary. Mr. Mourdock went on to lose to Mr. Donnelly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mourdock painted Mr. Lugar as out of touch with the state, and emphasized the fact that he lived in Virginia, a theme that Mr. Rokita has reprised against Mr. Messer. He has also made an issue of the fact that Mr. Messer\u2019s wife, a lawyer, is on the payroll of an Indianapolis suburb even though she, too, lives in Virginia.\n\nMr. Messer, the father of two teenage daughters, said he was raised by a single parent and felt it important to be closer to his children, and said voters would understand.\n\nA competitive primary or multicandidate field can sometimes actually reflect party strength and enthusiasm, but if the contest becomes too negative, the party can suffer.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhere there are particularly competitive or divisive primaries, it is bad for the parties when they go to the general,\u201d said Andrew B. Hall, a political scientist at Stanford University who has studied the subject. \u201cThings are getting put on record that make you look weak. You alienate some of your own base. You\u2019ve expended some of your resources.\u201d\n\nMr. Donnelly has no serious opposition for the Democratic nomination, though he is already under assault from Republican-aligned groups that are spending millions of dollars to defeat him.\n\nEach of the Republican candidates has tried to emphasize ties to Mr. Trump in a state the president won by 19 percentage points. Mr. Braun claims a Trump-like background, having built a logistics company in southern Indiana that now employs 850 people and gave him wealth that he can spend heavily on his own campaign.\n\nHe said Mr. Messer and Mr. Rokita were professional politicians, lawyers who \u201cnever practiced\u201d but always had their eyes on the next political rung. Mr. Braun served briefly in the State Legislature.\n\nIn a candidate debate, in which Mr. Braun wore jeans and a denim shirt, he made the case harshly. In a new ad, he uses humor, carrying cardboard cutouts of the two men \u2014 dressed identically in white shirt, red tie and dark suit \u2014 and asked voters if they could tell the difference between them.\n\n\u201cWhere is your real world experience?\u201d Mr. Braun said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any.\u201d He added: \u201cThey are creating a large avenue up the middle between two career politicians. That was a gift that kept on giving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Braun dismissed Mr. Rokita as a \u201csmash mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do and say things that might impress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he\u2019s trying to act like Trump it\u2019s kind of a poor impression.\u201d\n\nHe also said there could be lingering damage: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got sharp elbows, that creates a long memory for the people hit by those elbows.\u201d\n\nHe rejected Mr. Rokita\u2019s charge that he was a recent Republican convert, saying he had never voted for a Democrat for a federal office.\n\nMr. Messer, whose campaign so far has been the most measured of the three, accused Mr. Rokita of \u201ctrying to make things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Mr. Messer said. \u201cYou can\u2019t find one interview in the entire campaign where I didn\u2019t make the point that we need to elect President Trump. Do I agree with every single President Trump tweet? No. I\u2019ve expressed a few times my concerns about the president. But throughout, I have supported him and voted for the president in the primary.\u201d\n\nAll the candidates embrace some of the president\u2019s core positions, like the need for a wall along the Mexican border, and all pledge to be a solid voice for the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nMr. Rokita\u2019s opponents say his voting record suggests otherwise: Mr. Rokita voted against the budget deal that Mr. Trump signed this year\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe said he did so because the bill contained too much federal spending. But, Mr. Rokita added, because he supported Mr. Trump before his rivals and has the endorsement of people who ran the Trump campaign in the state, he can disagree with the president, something he said Mr. Messer could not do.\n\n\u201cNow he has to do everything he can to pander to the president and Mike Pence,\u201d Mr. Rokita said. \u201cOh, the president wanted this terrible spending bill. Whereas I, in a very healthy way, can say no to things like the spending bill and still be on the side of the president.\u201d\n\nEven with all the friction in the primary so far, if there are safe places for the midterm elections to be a referendum on Mr. Trump, Indiana is surely among them. Republicans will pour extraordinary resources into the effort to oust Mr. Donnelly, and the president and Vice President Mike Pence, the former Indiana governor, will be able to give the senate nominee added firepower.\n\nThat gives Republicans comfort that they can endure a fractious primary. \u201cPeople are very energized,\u201d Mr. Grand said. \u201cThey are not playing into this thing that \u201918 is going to be a bad year.\u201d", "title": "In Indiana and Beyond, Bruising G.O.P.

But questions about who was behind them and why they wanted Ms. Caruana Galizia dead remain unanswered.\n\n\u201cThe brutal assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia was aimed at instilling fear in everyone,\u201d a European Parliament delegation to Malta said in a report released in January, \u201cespecially those involved in investigating and prosecuting cases of money laundering and corruption.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter her death, 45 journalists from 18 news organizations agreed to work together to pursue leads from her work on corruption and international money-laundering networks, as well as look into the circumstances surrounding her death.

The men charged with the killing \u2014 the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, and Vincent Muscat, no relation to the prime minister, who shares the surname \u2014 have pleaded not guilty but have otherwise refused to talk, and they remain in custody.\n\nBut the police say the three men were tipped off to their imminent arrest, according to evidence gathered in the investigation. Among the allegations the victim\u2019s family passed to investigators is that Mr. Cardona, the economy minister, and two of the suspects in the killing were regulars at the same out-of-the-way bar.\n\nIn a written response, Mr. Cardona said that the bar, Ferdinand\u2019s, \u201cwelcomes patrons from all walks of life, including other politicians.\u201d He added, \u201cI do not, however, recall having any discussions with any of these individuals, and have definitely never had any meetings with them.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cardona said that he had not been interviewed in connection with the case.

Six months after her death, neither the bomb maker nor the person or people who wanted her dead have been found.\n\n\u201cThere is now a sense of impunity, a culture of impunity,\u201d said Simon Busuttil, the former leader of the opposition Nationalist Party. \u201cSo everyone thinks they can get away with murder,\u201d he added, \u201cperhaps even literally.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the point, a Russian woman identified as one of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s sources has applied for political asylum in Greece, where she fled in fear for her life after the assassination, and she is fighting extradition.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her years as a muckraking journalist, Ms. Caruana Galizia angered countless people on this island, not to mention an Iranian-born banker, drug-trafficking syndicates and the president of Azerbaijan. Ms. Caruana Galizia was no stranger to threats. In 1995, someone slit her dog\u2019s throat and laid its body on her doorstep. In 2006, unidentified perpetrators stacked five large tires filled with bottles of gasoline against the back of her home and set them ablaze.\n\nIn an interview she gave to a researcher from the Council of Europe shortly before her death, Ms. Caruana Galizia, 53, described \u201ca climate of fear\u201d in Malta, a country where people were afraid of the consequences of speaking out.\n\n\u201cThere have been periods where literally I would feel like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to get a stomach ulcer,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat churning, churning nerves all the time.

And even amid praising Mr. Trump on Wednesday, he added, \u201cI love Hillary too.\u201d\n\nThe journalist Alex Wagner, a host of the Showtime series \u201cThe Circus\u201d and a former editor in chief of the culture magazine The Fader, said that the right latching on to Mr. West\u2019s statements was no surprise given the dearth of options.\n\n\u201cDo you remember how hard a time Donald Trump had getting celebrities for his inauguration?\u201d she said. \u201cSo to have an incredibly powerful and influential musician \u2014 and a black musician at that \u2014 come out and don a Make America Great Again cap, it\u2019s a gift to Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs far as whether it\u2019s grounded in any particular political ideology, I don\u2019t think it is,\u201d she added. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing Kanye West and Donald Trump have in common, it\u2019s unpredictability and a love of the spotlight.\u201d\n\nMr. West, whose representatives declined to comment, began his latest foray into politics last weekend. He praised the thinking of the black conservative commentator Candace Owens, who has spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement. He went on to compliment Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump supporter, as well as the \u201cDilbert\u201d cartoonist Scott Adams, who has rebranded himself as a conservative thinker.\n\nAbout the president, he wrote admiringly that they both shared \u201cdragon energy\u201d and that \u201che is my brother.\u201d He also posted a photo of his Trump-autographed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap.\n\nThe backlash came quickly as fans on social media and the culture publications that follow Mr. West closely made their dismay clear: \u201cKanye West Doesn\u2019t Care About Black People,\u201d read a headline on The Root, while The Ringer explored \u201cThe Kanye West Delusion.\u201d\n\nThe singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e criticized Mr. West\u2019s comments in a radio interview on Wednesday. \u201cI believe in freethinking,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe in freethinking if it\u2019s rooted in, or at the expense of the oppressed.\u201d And in text messages posted on Twitter by Mr. West, John Legend told the rapper, \u201cSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump\u2019s policies cause, especially to people of color.\u201d\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative student movement that has worked with Ms. Owens, was unreserved in calling Mr. West\u2019s support \u201ca pretty extraordinary moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize that black Americans, and in particular black celebrities, should be allowed to have different opinions without being called mentally unhealthy or crazy,\u201d Mr. Kirk said, referring to reports that some in Mr. West\u2019s circle were again worried about his mental health following his late 2016 hospitalization, which also coincided with expressing his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cI think we should embrace celebrities that challenge groupthink and monolithic perspectives on political issues.\u201d\n\nMr. West\u2019s refusal to back down in the face of criticism was markedly different than the reaction of the Canadian country singer Shania Twain, who apologized on Sunday after she was quoted in an interview saying that she would have voted for Mr. Trump if she could. Following a fan backlash online, Ms. Twain issued a statement: \u201cAs a Canadian, I regret answering this unexpected question without giving my response more context,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not hold any common moral beliefs with the current president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. West, on the other hand, was defiant. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with trump but the mob can\u2019t make me not love him,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nChance the Rapper, a frequent collaborator, backed him up: \u201cBlack people don\u2019t have to be democrats,\u201d he wrote, though he backtracked on Friday, after Mr. Trump thanked him by name, writing that his initial tweet \u201cwas a deflection from the real conversation.\u201d Though Chance said he had hoped to stand by his mentor Mr. West, \u201cit\u2019s not my job to defend or protect him,\u201d he wrote, but rather to \u201cpick up the phone and talk to him about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Shapiro warned that this moment could be fleeting. \u201cIs this going to be a serious movement? I highly doubt it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSome conservative groups sought to take advantage right away. On Thursday, a text advertisement for one of the president\u2019s campaign fund-raising organizations included the message \u201cDON\u2019T BE SILENCED,\u201d adding, \u201cWe support Kanye speaking his mind, even if sometimes we do not agree on the issues.\u201d Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist behind Info Wars, has invited the rapper on his broadcast while posting positive messages about him on Twitter more than 30 times since Sunday. (Mr. West has not publicly responded to the invitation.)\n\nEbro Darden, a popular radio personality from the New York rap station Hot 97, said, \u201cThey are exploiting Kanye West, and yes, Kanye West is O.K. with being exploited.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s down for the shenanigans,\u201d Mr. Darden said of the rapper, with whom he spoke by phone about politics multiple times this week. \u201cHe\u2019s an opportunist, a provocateur, a troll, a challenger of conventional thought and somebody who wants to be seen at all times, when he\u2019s ready to be seen.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Darden cautioned that Mr. West\u2019s endgame was likely not Republican politics. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to take people on a journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve expressed to him is that he better hurry up and get to his destination.\u201d", "title": "In Kanye West, the Right Sees Truth-Telling and a Rare A-List Ally", "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"]}

She had never been treated, however, and hid her symptoms from her employers and all but her closest family members.\n\nIn the weeks before the murder, Ms. Ortega had been hearing voices, including one she thought was Satan\u2019s, commanding her to kill the children, Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg said. Several family members and friends testified that Ms. Ortega\u2019s behavior became more and more bizarre during that period: She complained of shadows following her, cried frequently and spoke cryptically of a \u201cblack man\u201d who was trying to split up her family.\n\n\u201cShe was coming apart at the seams,\u201d Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg said. \u201cIt was getting more chaotic in her head. The voices were overtaking her. Then on Oct. 25, 2012, she capitulated.\u201d\n\nTwo psychiatrists for the defense testified that Ms. Ortega was psychotic at the time of the murders and had a break with reality, entering what they called \u201ca dissociative state.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer mind and her body separated metaphysically,\u201d Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg said. \u201cThat is what the evidence has shown.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Silberg pointed out that when Ms. Ortega woke in the hospital days later, after being treated for a self-inflicted neck wound, she had a litany of petty complaints about her working conditions, but never asked about the children. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knew what had happened to them.\u201d\n\nMs. Ortega, 55, never disputed that she had killed Leo Krim, 2, and his sister, Lucia, 6, using two kitchen knives.

Resnick, who determined Ms. Ortega suffered from an undiagnosed psychosis for decades.\n\nMs. Ortega\u2019s lawyer also called as witnesses eight of the defendant\u2019s family members and friends, who described Ms. Ortega\u2019s past mental breakdowns in 1978 and 2008, when she became a paranoid shut-in after people close to her died. Her family members also described her crying fits, nervousness and paranoia about \u201cshadows\u201d following her in the days before the killings.\n\nMs. Van Leer-Greenberg pointed out that four psychiatrists at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, where Ms. Ortega was treated for her neck wound, came to the conclusion she had symptoms of psychosis, a diagnosis later confirmed by doctors at Elmhurst Hospital Center.\n\nYet Mr. Silberg argued that Ms. Ortega\u2019s sisters, Delci Ortega and Miladys Garcia, came forward with information about Ms. Ortega\u2019s past symptoms of mental illness only after speaking with her defense lawyers months after the killings. \u201cAll the stories that were told to you by Delci Ortega and Miladys were made up,\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThose are the witnesses the defense wants you to believe.\u201d\n\nMs. Van Leer-Greenberg argued that the idea all of Ms. Ortega\u2019s friends and family members \u2014 some of whom were subpoenaed to testify \u2014 were lying about her symptoms seemed far-fetched. \u201cYou have to believe these eight separate lay witnesses that have no background in psychiatry made up symptoms that were consistent with paranoid delusions, audio hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, major depressive disorder and dissociation,\u201d she said.\n\nShe suggested insanity was the only explanation for the crime, since Ms. Ortega had repeatedly told her sisters and other relatives she loved the Krim children. \u201cThe lack of a motive is the hallmark of her mental illness,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Silberg reminded jurors that Kevin and Marina Krim had testified they saw no sign Ms. Ortega was losing her mind. He also noted Ms. Ortega appeared to be managing her life without trouble, enrolling her son in a private high school, moving houses twice that year and handling her own finances.\n\nMr. Silberg suggested Ms. Ortega was simply furious with Marina Krim over her schedule and workload and planned to kill the children and herself to get back at her. \u201cIf she loved them, she wouldn\u2019t have killed them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s rage and resentment reached a boiling point.\u201d", "title": "In Nanny Murder Trial, Jury Hears Closing Arguments", "authors": ["James C.

Yankee Stadium, with its inviting right-field dimensions, seems well suited to the right-handed-hitting Stanton\u2019s right-field-first approach. He has played only two previous games at Yankee Stadium, both in 2015. He homered off C. C. Sabathia in one of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPeople yelling and screaming at B.P., already ready to go walking in,\u201d Stanton said, recalling the atmosphere at batting practice.\n\nBut Stanton, who hit two home runs Thursday in the Yankees\u2019 season opener at Toronto, could have a tougher time making a similarly strong first impression on the home fans. He is hitless in six at-bats against Archer. (Aaron Judge, who is off to a sluggish start, has not fared much better, with one hit in nine at-bats.)\n\nIf the weather provided a mild inconvenience for the Yankees, the Mets used their unscheduled day off to reconfigure their rotation. Matt Harvey, who was scheduled to pitch Monday, is set to go on Tuesday, and that day\u2019s scheduled starter, Seth Lugo, will be skipped to allow the ace Noah Syndergaard to face the Phillies on Wednesday.\n\nThe Mets could have pushed Syndergaard back a day to face the National League East favorite Washington Nationals on Thursday, but chose to let Jacob deGrom open that series instead.\n\nThese types of decisions will get more scrutiny in New York for now because they are being made by rookie managers, Mickey Calloway of the Mets and Boone. And though Boone was faced with rapid-fire decisions over the weekend \u2014 injury substitutions, roster replacements and strategic moves \u2014 and some mild second-guessing in a loss on Sunday, he appeared eager to pull back the curtain for the home opener.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just excited to be here and walk out there in pinstripes, and go out there and try to get after it,\u201d Boone said.\n\nINSIDE PITCH\n\nMets outfielder Michael Conforto, who had shoulder surgery in September, could be activated from the disabled list as early as Thursday. \u2026 Reliever Ben Heller, whom the Yankees sent to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, had his option revoked and is being placed on the disabled list with bone spurs in his right elbow. \u2026 The veteran left-handed pitcher Oliver Perez signed a minor league contract with the Yankees.", "title": "In New York, Yankees and Mets Take a Snow Day", "authors": ["Billy Witz"]}

Members are elected to life terms, and if they choose to stop participating in the activities of the academy, their seat is left vacant until death.\n\nEven before the scandal, two seats were occupied by inactive members.

In the film, Jennifer Jones played the heroine, in her maid\u2019s cap and apron, and French actor Charles Boyer was Adam Belinski, the refugee Czech intellectual roue, on the Hollywood assumption that one European accent is as good as another.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s a delightful movie, but it\u2019s an even better book, shifting deftly from the concerns of Squire and Lady Carmel and Andrew the young heir, to the real center of the novel, Cluny, the plumber\u2019s niece from London who is sent into \u201cgood service\u201d as a parlormaid right before the World War II because she \u201cdon\u2019t seem to know her place,\u201d and who turns out to be able to navigate a wider and more rapidly evolving world than anyone around her anticipates.\n\nSharp had her devoted following; when \u201cThe Eye of Love\u201d was published in 1957, she was a sufficiently established writer for Kirkus to comment, \u201cMargery Sharp addicts may find this to their taste.\u201d Actually, this postwar novel is one of her best, a lapidary work about the shattered affair between Dolores Diver, who sees herself as a \u201cSpanish type,\u201d (she changed her name from Dorothy Hogg) and her adoring lover Harry, who must marry another woman to save his business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSharp, who as a narrator reliably has her Jane Austen moments, comments on the first page of \u201cThe Eye of Love\u201d: \u201cLadies of ambiguous status have by convention hearts of gold, and Miss Diver was nothing if not conventional; but a child in an irregular household is often an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nThe child is Martha, who moves to the foreground in the two sequels, \u201cMartha in Paris,\u201d and \u201cMartha, Eric and George.\u201d Martha is a stolid plump child, and an artistic prodigy; as she learns to paint, and faces the conventional dilemmas of love and sex (and the consequences of sex) and professionalism, she offers a completely unique portrait of female genius, in all its single-minded dedication and selfishness. \u201cMartha would chop us all up for India rubber, if we were made of India rubber,\u201d says her patron approvingly.\n\nPhoto\n\nSharp is interested in how her characters are shaped by their fantasies of themselves (Cluny Brown takes herself to tea at the Ritz, scandalizing her uncle; Dolores Diver treasures her carved tortoiseshell comb and her signature Spanish shawl), but also how they react when those fantasies bring them up against reality. And this combination of interior life and social reality makes for what may be her greatest portrait in \u201cBritannia Mews,\u201d her novel of life on a disreputable London street from 1875 through to the Blitz; the book is a love letter to London and Londoners, and the central character, Adelaide, is an extraordinarily distinct creation, determined and definite in her passions, her actions and her ambitions.\n\nWriting in the Book-of-the-Month Club News, the novelist John P. Marquand hailed the book as \u201ca fine novel along traditional lines in a beautifully cultivated style that is both polite and biting, and yet its whole complexion is devastatingly clear and modern.\u201d\n\nAs always, Sharp takes on potentially sentimental subjects with a tone which is almost shockingly unsentimental; never has the trope of a Victorian drawing master romancing his sheltered female pupil been rendered less romantic. Adelaide\u2019s life unfolds in the sordid surroundings of Britannia Mews as a consequence; she pursues the hapless drawing teacher, despite his attempts to warn her off.\n\n\u201cI drink like a fish,\u201d he tells her, and she assures him that she will put a stop to all that: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a very strong character I have.\u201d She\u2019s wrong about being able to stop his drinking, but she\u2019s certainly right about her own character. It\u2019s one of Sharp\u2019s great talents, creating female characters of toughness and complexity. She gave us profound \u2014 and sympathetic \u2014 portraits of mothers who feel notably unmoved by motherhood, for example, and realistic stories of women deeply motivated by money, by art, and yes, by sex, even as she created other gentler women in counterpoint, more daunted by convention, but sometimes tougher in the end.\n\nMargery Sharp is sometimes compared to Barbara Pym and to Elizabeth Taylor, and there are certainly overlaps (the retreat for Anglican gentlewomen in \u201cSummer Visits,\u201d her last novel, published in 1977, seems like it could be peopled with Barbara Pym characters), but Sharp has a touch all her own when it comes to taking on social class, sex and its consequences, and the changes that the 20th century brought to both those arenas, most especially for women. She remained, always, both polite and biting, looking at the intoxications and delusions of life and love with wit and clear-eyed sympathy. And if you try a novel and you like it, you can experience the delightful certainty that there are more than two dozen of them waiting, without even counting the mice.\n\nPhoto", "title": "In Praise of Margery Sharp", "authors": ["Perri Klass", "The Enthusiast"]}

Ashe, a Republican and former longtime mayor of Knoxville. He predicted a tight race and said Ms. Blackburn could not afford to lose a significant chunk of Republican voters.\n\nIn a nominal show of support for Ms. Blackburn, Mr. Corker wrote on Twitter last week that he was sending a donation to her campaign and wished her well in the Senate race. But in a brief interview, he said he would not campaign against Mr. Bredesen, recounting their long history working together and describing him as a friend.\n\n\u201cHe was a very good mayor, very good governor, very good businessperson,\u201d Mr. Corker said, adding, \u201cHe would be successful at anything that he did and is someone I consider to be very thoughtful.\u201d\n\nBut there is ample reason for skepticism about Mr. Bredesen\u2019s chances: No Democrat has won a statewide race in Tennessee since his successful re-election bid in 2006, and the state has turned more Republican since then. He will have to avoid being portrayed as being in lock step with national Democratic figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.\n\nMs. Blackburn and her allies \u201cknow that Bredesen is popular; they know that the national brand of the Democratic Party is not,\u201d said Kent Syler, who teaches at Middle Tennessee State and was a longtime aide to the former Democratic congressman Bart Gordon. \u201cSo they will work very hard to connect him to that national brand, and he will work very hard to avoid that.\u201d\n\nMr. Bredesen, 74, jumped into the race after Mr. Corker, a two-term Republican, decided to retire. A wealthy former health care executive who served as mayor of Nashville before becoming governor, Mr. Bredesen said he concluded that he was probably the only Democrat who would have a reasonable shot at winning the seat. In a video announcing his candidacy, he reminded voters of the successes of his tenure, including reining in the soaring cost of TennCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which had been financially troubled.\n\nHis decision to run for the Senate was a coup for Democrats in Washington who have been mapping out how to flip control of the chamber in November\u2019s elections, even as their caucus defends 26 seats, 10 in states won by Mr. Trump, while the Republicans must guard only nine. Once seen as far-fetched, winning a majority is at least mathematically possible, especially after a Democrat, Doug Jones, won a special election in Alabama in December.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSkepticism of a Democratic takeover of the Senate has come from an unlikely voice in Tennessee: Mr. Bredesen. To Republicans who suggest a vote for him is a vote to make Mr. Schumer the majority leader, he pushed back on the idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible, I\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said, naming Florida, Missouri and North Dakota as states where Democratic incumbents could be in danger. \u201cMy expectation is that I will be in the minority in the Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. Bredesen is walking a careful line when it comes to Mr. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton by 26 percentage points in Tennessee. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not running against Donald Trump,\u201d he says in a television commercial that is textbook Bredesen sobriety.\n\nIn the interview, he emphasized his attentiveness to rural voters who feel as if elected leaders are not doing anything to help them, recalling his own upbringing in upstate New York and offering a pointed critique of today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cMy party, I think, has gotten way too far to the left and needs to learn how to win elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we Democrats have gotten too elitist. We\u2019ve gotten too narrow. We\u2019ve gotten too involved in litmus tests.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe continued: \u201cI\u2019d like to belong to a church that\u2019s bringing new members in, not routing out dissidents or heretics or something like that, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve gotten too much in the latter.\u201d\n\nStill, there are clear policy differences between Mr. Bredesen and the president. Mr. Bredesen said Mr. Trump\u2019s promised wall along the border with Mexico was \u201cpolitical theater, not anything practical.\u201d He also criticized the Republican tax overhaul for providing \u201ccrumbs\u201d to the middle class \u2014 echoing a description previously used by Ms. Pelosi that Republicans eagerly seized on.\n\n\u201cI think they did something which was clever politically, but I couldn\u2019t have swallowed morally, which is I think they threw a few crumbs to the middle class to give these huge breaks to wealthier people and corporations and so on,\u201d Mr. Bredesen said. \u201cAnd I think I would have called that out as strongly as I possibly could have.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She has been a leading opponent of abortion, overseeing a House panel that investigated Planned Parenthood and the sale of fetal tissue for medical research. She once debated climate change with the television personality Bill Nye.\n\nIn a video announcing her candidacy, she described herself as a \u201chard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative,\u201d spoke of carrying a gun in her purse, declared she was \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d and said, with a note of pride, that liberals call her a \u201cwing nut.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Blackburn\u2019s full-throated conservatism is distinctive compared with the relatively moderate tone of Republicans whom Tennessee voters have sent to the Senate in the past \u2014 a group that includes Howard H. Baker Jr., a former Senate majority leader who became known as \u201cthe great conciliator\u201d; another majority leader, Bill Frist; Mr. Corker; and Tennessee\u2019s senior senator, Lamar Alexander.\n\nIn a Vanderbilt University poll conducted last year, 76 percent of Tennessee voters said they preferred that their legislators worked with the other party, even if it meant compromising on some of their values.\n\nMs. Blackburn is sending a different message. \u201cReal conservative leadership,\u201d promises a palm card for her campaign. \u201cNo compromise, no apologies.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, questioned whether Tennessee voters would embrace a candidate in that mold over someone with a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly image.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a politician on that level of anybody that\u2019s been kind of mocked for their antediluvian ways,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Blackburn suggested that people in Tennessee needed to get accustomed to the idea of being represented in the Senate by a woman.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the things that you\u2019ll hear people talk about from time to time, because Tennessee\u2019s never had a female senator,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it is going to be a little bit different, if you will. An approach will be different.\u201d\n\nThen there is the unresolved question of just how much Ms. Blackburn will be able to exploit Mr. Bredesen\u2019s party affiliation \u2014 even if Mr. Bredesen himself is not eager to dwell on it.\n\nVoters may have fond memories of Mr. Bredesen as governor, but will they want to help expand the ranks of the Senate Democratic caucus?

When we came to Sri Lanka to report on the spate of Facebook-linked violence in the developing world, we thought we\u2019d found ours in a young Buddhist monk from a small mountain town.\n\nBut, we would soon learn, that monk\u2019s story was more morally complicated than we\u2019d anticipated \u2014 and our story on Facebook larger and darker than what we\u2019d initially planned.\n\nA week earlier, mobs of Sinhalese-speaking Buddhists, the country\u2019s majority group, had risen up, inspired by anti-Muslim misinformation and hate speech on Facebook. They destroyed mosques and Muslim homes in several towns, killing one man.\n\nBut, here, the monk we\u2019d heard about, Nelligala Dhammaratne, had met the mob in the street. Drawing on his religious authority and sway with the community, he admonished its members to disperse. The local mosque was saved.\n\nMr. Dhammaratne was meant to provide a heroic contrast to our story\u2019s villains: the extremists who\u2019d dominated social media here and in other developing countries, using it to whip people into paranoid rages that sometimes became deadly.\n\nWe thought we had a story about good guys and bad guys battling for control of the vast information spaces that Facebook opens up in countries like Sri Lanka. That was in line with Facebook\u2019s own worldview, that the platform heightens any society\u2019s pre-existing tendencies for good and bad. In this view, Facebook has a responsibility to mitigate the bad, but could hardly be blamed for creating it.\n\nBut Mr. Dhammaratne was not what we\u2019d expected. Spending time with him at his mountaintop temple, overlooking rolling green hills, we realized that our understanding of Facebook\u2019s role in societies with weak institutions went far beyond magnifying good and bad alike.\n\nYes, he\u2019d stopped the mob. But he also recited to us, as unvarnished truth, some of the very anti-Muslim rumors that had spread in viral Facebook memes before the attack. Muslim shop owners put chemicals in bras to sterilize Buddhist women. Muslim doctors sterilized Buddhist patients without their knowledge. Muslims in government were secret extremists.\n\nHow did he know this? \u201cThe whole country heard about this\u201d on Facebook, he answered. Had he discussed this with his constituents in the run-up to the violence? Of course.\n\nWe came to understand that Facebook\u2019s algorithm-driven newsfeed, by pushing out whatever content drew the most engagement from users, does more than amplify existing prejudices or boost extremists.\n\nBy pushing out content charged by negative, primal emotions like anger or fear \u2014 which, studies show, perform best on the algorithm \u2014 the platform can change how people see the world and relate to one another. In countries with weak institutions but where Facebook use is widespread, that can allow misinformation to run rampant. And in societies with histories of deep social distrust, it can turn deadly.\n\nMr. Dhammaratne, meant to show how society\u2019s gatekeepers guard against those forces, turned out to exemplified that even the well-intentioned are overwhelmed by these forces. This would not be a story of heroes and villains, we learned, but of victims on both sides of the violence.\n\nFacebook, designed to deliver dopamine hits like a casino slot machine, had inadvertently enlisted everyday Sri Lankans in constructing an alternate reality out of the emotionally charged rumors and us-versus-them hate that performed best on the algorithm.\n\nWho were they \u2014 suddenly plugged into one of the most sophisticated media platforms in history, which presented itself as a portal for news and information \u2014 to resist?\n\n\u201cSinhalese people who had been perfectly fine were getting provoked into action,\u201d Mr. Dhammaratne said, referring to emotionally charged Facebook content, which had made it difficult for members of his congregation to distinguish truth from reality.\n\nWe would see that pattern, of otherwise well-meaning bystanders provoked by online anger and fear, play out in a number of cases we tracked across the developing world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ability of these apps to transmit messages, especially audio and video, so quickly and to such large groups, that is how this wave of violence was created,\u201d Mr. Dhammaratne said.\n\nHe said the government had been right to temporarily block social media; \u201cThat\u2019s how this got controlled.\u201d\n\nBut Facebook has become too essential for day-to-day life to be shut down, he added. It will have to be regulated or better policed, though he was unsure how.

In late 2012, he was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Administration after being lured to Liberia. Ever since, Mr. Le Roux, 45, has been assisting the authorities in rounding up the members of his sprawling organization in an effort to reduce a possible life sentence.\n\nIn 2013, he helped the D.E.A. launch a sting operation in Thailand that led to Mr. Hunter\u2019s first arrest and eventual sentence of 20 years in prison. In that case, the drug agency caught Mr. Hunter and three others agreeing to murder one of its agents and an informant.

Its members traveled the globe \u2014 from Mozambique to Papua New Guinea \u2014 often using false passports and code names like Daddy Mac and Rambo to scout locations for Mr. Le Roux, watch his assets and maim or murder on his behalf.\n\nAmong those murdered was Mr. Smith, Mr. Le Roux admitted. He said he had his henchman killed in 2010 after finding out that Mr. Smith was cheating him. Mr. Le Roux subsequently named Mr. Hunter his security chief.\n\nA former Army sergeant with Special Forces training, Mr. Hunter, 52, had served in the military and with two private security firms in Iraq. During the sting in Thailand, he was caught on camera boasting of the vicious acts he committed for Mr. Le Roux: how he waterboarded one man, shot a second in the hand and pitched a third \u2014 another suspected thief \u2014 overboard at sea.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Le Roux testified that after two men on his hit team \u2014 a gunman from New Zealand and a former member of the French Foreign Legion \u2014 quit their jobs, he instructed Mr. Hunter to replace them. Mr. Hunter, emails show, reached out to Mr. Samia, a onetime Army sniper, who lived near Mr. Stillwell, a firearms instructor, in the small town of Roxboro, N.C.\n\nFlight records indicate that Mr. Samia, 43, and Mr. Stillwell, 50, flew to Manila in January 2011, where, Mr. Le Roux recalled, he supplied the men with a rifle (for long shots), a pistol (for close-range shots) and an MP5 submachine gun from a weapons warehouse he maintained. He also gave them Ms. Lee\u2019s address.\n\nOne month later, Mr. Le Roux said, the two men followed the plan he had concocted: posing as real-estate buyers, they lured Ms. Lee in a Toyota van into the countryside near Las Pi\u00f1as. Mr. Stillwell later told the D.E.A. that he was driving the van as Mr. Samia fired the pistol into Ms. Lee\u2019s face.\n\nIn early March, Mr. Hunter drove both men to the airport and put them on a plane, Mr. Le Roux said.

The stories should speak for themselves. The note is a plea, Mr. President. Please eradicate slavery.\u201d Later in the same piece: \u201cMy guess is that slavery won\u2019t disappear until only two human beings are left alive, neither one strong enough to enslave the other. Anyway, please read on and enjoy the stories that follow. \u2026 No obligation to free a single slave of any color.\u201d\n\nWith this blunt, furious opening, Wideman puts us on notice: Wherever we\u2019re going with him, we\u2019re going to engage with America\u2019s unhealed wounds of slavery and racism \u2014 and it\u2019s not going to be comfortable or easy. Wideman\u2019s stories range widely over experiences from slavery to the present day. Among the tales of the past: \u201cJB & FD,\u201d an imagined dialogue between John Brown and Frederick Douglass, and \u201cNat Turner Confesses,\u201d a disturbing voyage into the rebellion leader\u2019s mind. Among the present-day tales, two of the most striking are \u201cWilliamsburg Bridge,\u201d the musings of a man considering suicide, and \u201cMaps and Ledgers,\u201d which touches on the discomfort of an African-American writing teacher in a largely white institution. All are illumined by a searching intelligence and a willingness to test the boundaries of the short story form.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAmerican Histories\u201d is a hard book to categorize. Part of the difficulty is that Wideman often uses the facts of his life in a way that makes readers question what is true and what isn\u2019t. I usually avoid considering how a writer\u2019s personal life relates to his or her fiction, but with a number of the stories, most notably \u201cMaps and Ledgers,\u201d it\u2019s hard not to do. The narrator refers to his youngest brother and his son both having committed murder. Readers who have followed Wideman\u2019s career know that both of those things are, sadly, true. In 1986, at the age of 16, Wideman\u2019s son Jacob killed another teenager; he was only recently paroled. And Wideman\u2019s brother Robert is serving a life sentence in prison for murder, a situation Wideman grappled with in his tough-minded memoir \u201cBrothers and Keepers.\u201d Is including this information in the story a challenge to get the reader to set aside what he knows of the author\u2019s history? Or is it an invitation to consider what the horrors and triumphs of real life bring to bear on one\u2019s fiction?\n\nThe reader is encouraged to step out of the text in other ways as well. In the heart of \u201cWillamsburg Bridge,\u201d there is a reference to AlexReisner.com/NYC2. As would another other soul living in 2018, I put the book down immediately and went to the website, where the young man who owns it describes at length a suicide he saw on the bridge. Reisner, the viewer, is white, the fictional suicide a young black man, the contrast no doubt deliberate. These invitations to leave the text behind (for this is not the only one) seem to be part of Wideman\u2019s method of holding readers at bay, keeping them always guessing, always a little uncertain.\n\nI found the digressiveness of this collection frustrating at times \u2014 it\u2019s not a likable or easily accessible book. But in this case, that\u2019s not a criticism. \u201cAmerican Histories\u201d is not here to be liked. It\u2019s here to challenge you. And that it does.", "title": "In Stories About Slavery and Its Legacy, Hints of the Author\u2019s Life", "authors": ["Martha Southgate", "John Edgar Wideman"]}
{"date": "2018-04-19 00:00:00", "text": "On display at the opening will be works of 20 artists, mostly from the West Bank and Gaza, who are either still living there or are working as expatriates.\n\nThe range of media includes paintings, textiles, installation pieces and photography. The unifying, and qualifying, theme of the artwork is that it is either by Palestinian artists or represents Palestinian life.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is a dream,\u201d said the artist Manal Deeb, whose mixed-media works \u2014 incorporating photographs, oil paint and Arabic calligraphy \u2014 hang in the gallery. Her work was also exhibited at the United Nations Visitors Center in New York in 2012\u20142013. Born in Ramallah, Ms. Deeb moved to America as a teenager in 1986. Speaking by telephone from her studio in Fairfax, Va., she said the new Palestinian museum will provide her and other Palestinian artists with an outlet where there was none before.\n\n\u201cAs Palestinians, we all have the same core search for identity, and this is a way for us to all come together and save that identity,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Saleh said that the museum\u2019s agenda is neither political or religious, but few of the artists on display have avoided the historic and ongoing conflicts between Palestinians and the State of Israel. The impacts of war on women and children are a theme of Ms. Deeb\u2019s art, as well as that of 47-year-old Rana Bishara, born in 1971 in the Upper Galilee village of Tarshiha where she still lives part time. Her paintings in the museum feature abstracts that explore memories of childhood growing up amid political demonstrations, contrasted with the beauty of the natural world. To this end, much of her work features actual pieces of cactus, a symbol of razed villages where nothing remains but the prickly vegetation.\n\n\u201cFor me, cactus means to be patient,\u201d said Ms. Bishara, speaking by telephone during a recent visit to Savannah, Ga., where she earned an M.F.A. at the Savannah College of Art in 2003. \u201cOne of my famous works has pieces of pickled cactus, packed tightly in a jar, which depicts Palestinians who are living in Israel under the pressure of laws that treat us like second-class citizens or worse,\u201d Ms. Bishara said.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet for every statement of political resistance, there are images that simply evoke the human experience. In a vaguely Post-Impressionist interior by Ayed Arafah, a painter from the Dheisheh refugee camp, near Bethlehem, a cat looks up mischievously from an unraveled roll of toilet paper. A series of boldly colored portraits by the gallery\u2019s youngest painter, 18-year-old Malak Mattar, recall the stylistic primitivism of high Modernism. Ms. Mattar, a resident of Gaza, started painting therapeutically when she was 13, amid shelling during the 51-day military conflict with Israel in 2014. So despite the playfulness of her art, Ms. Mattar\u2019s life story draws gallery visitors back to the turmoil she and other Palestinian artists can face, which in turn informs their art.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cVery often, when artists are under that kind of war pressure, they produce some of their best work,\u201d said James Harithas, director of the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston. In 2003, the Texas gallery hosted \u201cMade in Palestine,\u201d probably the first museum exhibition of Palestinian art in the United States. The exhibit then toured nationally, and \u201cwas the most popular show we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Mr. Harithas said.\n\nAmong the 23 artists in the Houston show, and one of its major organizers, was a Jerusalem native, Samia Halaby, whose work is also on display in the Woodbridge museum. Ms. Halaby now lives in New York and, at 81, is something of a doyenne of the Palestinian art world. In her 2001 book, \u201cLiberation Art of Palestine: Palestinian Painting and Sculpture in the Second Half of the 20th Century,\u201d she traced the roots of modern Palestinian art to American abstract expressionism and the social activism of the Mexican muralists of the early 20-century. The powerful, revolutionary works of Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, as well as Picasso and the Cubists \u2014 whose blocky abstractions echoed the geometric patterns of classical Islamic art \u2014 planted seeds of inspiration for Palestinian artists of the 1970s and 1980s, Ms. Halaby said.\n\n\u201cIt was a high period for Palestinian artists, and one of the very important things to them was that their own people understood what they were doing,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, there are Palestinian artists who are now concerned with explaining the Palestinian issue to the outside world and a Western audience, which is why this new museum is so important.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

When the \u201cMade in Palestine\u201d exhibit traveled to New York in 2005, two state legislators and at least one assemblyman raised objections to the show, suggesting that it endorsed terrorism.\n\nSo far, the museum has faced no blowback from the local community, Mr. Saleh said. In fact, he enjoys good relations with one of his nonprofit neighbors, the Jewish Federation of Greater New Haven. When the organization\u2019s Jewish Community Center needed a temporary home last year after a fire, Mr. Saleh rented the Center space in his Woodbridge building, across the hall from the new museum.\n\nIn an email, the organization expressed appreciation for Mr. Saleh\u2019s support of the community center, and the Jewish Federation\u2019s chief executive, Judy Alperin, affirmed that she hoped there would be opportunities for bridge-building and dialogue once the museum opens.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Halaby said her art is not as much informed by any specific political agenda as it is by her fondness for Cubism, medieval Islamic art and Soviet Constructivism. Yet at the same time, she does not back away from her identity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to let you forget that I\u2019m Palestinian,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you look at my art, I am saying I\u2019m Palestinian, like it or hate it, here\u2019s what I do, and I do it very well,\u201d she said.", "title": "In Suburban Connecticut, the Palestinian Avant-Garde", "authors": ["Tom Verde"]}

While some of this plays on a nostalgia factor for readers of Ketzel\u2019s generation, it\u2019s a device that gets old rather quickly, especially for anyone unfamiliar with midcentury Jewish comedians.\n\nImage\n\nKetzel\u2019s brother Potsie lives in Las Vegas, and that\u2019s where her parents send her to look for him with the help of Ebby, an old high school crush who has conveniently left the L.V.P.D. to become a private eye. The novel rather often relies on such conveniences, as when Ketzel\u2019s cabby from the Vegas airport just happens to tell her one of the jokes that Ketzel\u2019s late husband invented \u2014 moreover, he claims to have heard the joke from the source himself.\n\nAt the time of Morty\u2019s death Ketzel thought they were the loves of each other\u2019s lives, but she has since discovered receipts indicating that he cheated his way up and down the country with strippers and prostitutes. What she finds even more offensive, though, is that during his research into dirty jokes he acquired several incredibly valuable sex toys of yore that he could have sold off rather than relying on Ketzel\u2019s meager income to support them. Instead Ketzel spent her life waitressing, giving up her dream of becoming a comedian like the men she idolized in her childhood.\n\nAs Ketzel and Ebby go about their investigation, she becomes even further disillusioned with the people she loves. Both Ebby and her parents\u2019 beloved valet, Leo, turn out to have committed murder; and her brother Potsie isn\u2019t just a gambler with a candy addiction, but a bookie who runs in a sleazy circle that includes their miscreant cousin Perry. Ketzel discovers that this despised Perry, who runs a strip joint catering to the naughty schoolgirl fantasy, has also disappeared \u2014 but considering that he once persuaded her to dance naked on film for him when he was a teenager and she only 10, she doesn\u2019t mind his absence too much, linked to Potsie\u2019s though it may be.\n\nAround the middle of the novel, Ketzel becomes the full-time caretaker for her teenage niece, Meryl \u2014 another convenient device, as it gives Ketzel the child she always wanted but never had because Morty wasn\u2019t into the idea. Meryl is a great kid even though her mother has gone to live in a literal hole in the ground and changed her name to ValZorah and her latest stepmother flew the coop after Potsie disappeared. She is so easily pleased by her Aunt Ketzel\u2019s abilities to stock the fridge and make grilled cheeses that it\u2019s clear she hasn\u2019t been well cared for in a good while. The relationship between Ketzel and Meryl is one of the highlights of the book, and does something to make up for Ketzel\u2019s increasingly annoying observations about everything modern that she finds distasteful.\n\nAlthough the plot seems fairly innocent \u2014 woman goes to find her brother, begins to flirt with an old flame, takes care of her niece \u2014 it does take place in Las Vegas, and Pollack is good at describing the ironies of the city: the glitzy facade hiding a slew of sad, tired characters beaten down by life. But it\u2019s also a place of opportunities and chance, and one of the most endearing moments in the book is when Ketzel gets to perform a new comedy act, albeit in a club called Nips. It\u2019s the culmination of Ketzel\u2019s growth from a grieving widow who relied on her husband\u2019s opinions to a modern feminist who is becoming more aware of the realities of the women supporting sex-obsessed men.", "title": "In This Novel, a Grieving Widow Becomes the Detective Hero", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "text": "In the class that I teach on the history of the digital revolution, the students discuss whether innovation is driven more by big government projects or by nimble entrepreneurs. The answer, of course, is that it usually involves a symbiotic mix, like the semiconductor industry, which arose out of the Pentagon and NASA\u2019s need to put guidance systems in the nose cones of rockets. Vannevar Bush was the dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a co-founder of Raytheon, and oversaw the government science programs that resulted in the atom bomb and electronic computer. He wrote a seminal paper in 1945, called \u201cScience \u2014 the Endless Frontier,\u201d which described how a collaboration of all three sectors he had been part of \u2014 academia, business and government \u2014 would drive innovation. Government funding of basic research in university labs would lead to discoveries in fundamental science that would be the \u201cseed\u201d for future inventions.\n\nMany innovations have progressed along that path. The ENIAC computer funded by the United States Army and built at the University of Pennsylvania was the genesis for UNIVAC and then most other electronic computers. The network funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and designed by a consortium of academic and private labs led eventually to today\u2019s internet. The National Science Foundation, started based on Vannevar Bush\u2019s paper, created a multiagency Digital Library Initiative that funded the academic research of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, which led to Google. The sequencing of the human genome, largely funded by the National Institutes of Health, planted the seeds for the biotech industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nNow space endeavors are following this \u201cinnovation progression,\u201d as we can call it. \u201cJust as Darpa served as the initial impetus for the internet and underwrote a lot of the costs of developing the internet in the beginning, it may be the case that NASA has essentially done the same thing by spending the money to build sort of fundamental technologies,\u201d Musk said a year after launching SpaceX. \u201cOnce we can bring the sort of commercial, free enterprise sector into it, then we can see the dramatic acceleration that we saw in the internet.\u201d\n\nOne of the first private pioneers was Burt Rutan, a mutton-chopped aircraft designer who regarded NASA as a bloated and unimaginative bureaucracy and in 1982 founded a company called Scaled Composites that designed aircraft so innovative that, as Davenport writes, \u201cit was as if his inspiration came not just from the laws of aerodynamics but from Picasso.\u201d One of his ideas was for a manned aircraft that could reach the edge of space and then fold its wings upward to act as a feather allowing the craft to re-enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land on a runway, and be reused. It would become his entry in the Ansari X Prize, which offered $10 million for the first private company that could launch a reusable vehicle to space twice within two weeks.\n\nRutan attracted two billionaire partners. The first was the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who as a schoolboy in Seattle yearned to become an astronaut but, being nearsighted, realized that was impossible so spent his time coding in the school\u2019s computer room with his friend Bill Gates. Rutan\u2019s second partner was the toothy goldilocked Richard Branson, a thrill-addicted serial adventurer and entrepreneur who was as enthusiastic about publicity as Allen was averse to it. Branson\u2019s personal motto for his company, Virgin, was \u201cScrew it, let\u2019s do it,\u201d which was no longer a guiding principle at NASA, and he created Virgin Galactic with the goal of taking tourists into space. \u201cPaul, isn\u2019t this better than the best sex you ever had?\u201d Branson asked Allen during one test flight as the spaceship climbed higher.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn 2004, Rutan\u2019s craft (with a Virgin logo on its tail) flew twice to space and back to win the X Prize. At the celebration, Rutan took a shot at NASA. \u201cI was thinking a little bit about that other space agency, the big guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at each other now and saying, \u2018We\u2019re screwed.\u2019\u201d Branson began selling tickets at prices that started at $200,000 to those who wanted to ride in a similar plane he began building, the launch date of which always seems to be about a year away.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s love of adventure came partly from his maternal grandfather, an accomplished amateur pilot in South Africa who in 1952 completed a 22,000-mile journey across the globe with no electronic instruments. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the eventual goal of colonizing Mars. \u201cThe more Musk studied, the more he realized that there had been very little advancement in rocket technology in the past 40 years,\u201d Davenport writes. \u201cTo a self-made Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur, this was stunning.\u201d His company\u2019s mantra was, \u201cSet audacious, nearly impossible goals and don\u2019t get dissuaded.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMusk\u2019s entrepreneurship had a social purpose. SpaceX, Tesla, his electric car company, and SolarCity, his renewable energy company, Fernholz writes, \u201cwere explicitly intended to further human civilization.\u201d Along the way, he developed a cultlike following. When SpaceX managed to launch a space capsule into orbit and dock it at the International Space Station in 2012, something NASA could no longer do on its own, the employees at his headquarters broke into a chant, \u201cWe love Elon!\u201d\n\nBezos was likewise inspired by his own maternal grandfather. Lawrence Preston Gise, an upright but loving naval commander, helped develop the hydrogen bomb during a stint at the Atomic Energy Commission and then retired to his sprawling Texas ranch to enjoy his family \u2014 and in particular his insatiably curious little grandson with very big ears, smile and laugh. Bezos\u2019 passion for space began when he was 5 and he watched with his family the launch of Apollo 11, the manned moon mission commanded by Neil Armstrong. \u201cIt really was a seminal moment for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember watching it on our living room TV, and the excitement of my parents and my grandparents. Little kids can pick up that kind of excitement.\u201d\n\nBezos spent every summer at his grandfather\u2019s ranch, where he fixed windmills, castrated cattle and geeked out on the tiny county library\u2019s surprisingly large sci-fi collection. His high school valedictorian speech was about space: how to colonize planets, build space hotels and save our fragile planet. \u201cSpace, the final frontier, meet me there!\u201d he concluded.\n\nWhen Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, naming it after that pale blue planet where humans originated, he called upon one of his favorite science fiction writers, Neal Stephenson, to be an adviser. They kicked around wildly novel ideas, such as using a bullwhip-like device to propel objects into space. Eventually Bezos focused on reusable rockets. \u201cHow is the situation in the year 2000 different from 1960?\u201d Stephenson asked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is computer sensors, cameras, software. Being able to land vertically is the kind of problem that can be addressed by those technologies that existed in 2000 that didn\u2019t exist in 1960.\u201d\n\nBezos began putting together a huge tract of ranch land in Texas where he could build his reusable rockets in secret. One of the great scenes in Davenport\u2019s book is the description of the helicopter trip Bezos took to find the land, which ended with a terrifying crash. He survived, and it conditioned him to the fact that flying machines sometimes fail. Among Bezos\u2019 many strengths is to be exuberant patiently, to have a long-term horizon, as he has done at Amazon. At his Texas ranch, he has begun construction of a 10,000-year \u201cClock of the Long Now\u201d designed by the futurist Danny Hillis, which has a century hand that advances every hundred years and a cuckoo that comes out every millennium. In the mission statement for his space company, he wrote, \u201cBlue will pursue this long-term objective patiently, step by step.\u201d As Elon Musk pushed forward with very public fits and starts, Bezos advised his team, \u201cBe the tortoise and not the hare.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2015, within a month of each other, Musk and Bezos both launched rockets that returned safely to earth and were reusable. For the moment, Musk the hare had darted ahead: His powerful Falcon 9 rocket had lifted a payload into orbit, whereas Bezos\u2019 smaller New Shepard craft had merely gone up into the edge of space and returned. But as happens with scrappy entrepreneurial business competitors, in contrast to government bureaucracies, Bezos and Musk were goading each other on. And unlike the race between the tortoise and the hare, they can both triumph \u2014 as can, one hopes, Richard Branson and others.\n\nIndeed, even NASA and its big corporate contractor, the United Launch Alliance, a venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, can come out winners from competition. As is often the case with the innovation progression, the greatest technological advances come when a symbiosis is reached that combines the resources of a visionary government and the scrappiness of risk-taking entrepreneurs, each spurring the other onward and upward.", "title": "In This Space Race, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk Are Competing to Take You There", "authors": ["Walter Isaacson"]}

In the early 1940s Russia\u2019s station chiefs in the West were ordered to gather evidence on any atomic work undertaken by American scientists. For example, a Soviet \u201cspook working under student cover\u201d went to see a professor at Columbia University, who asked him what he would think of a bomb that could completely destroy the center of New York City. The agent thought that was impossible, but the professor blurted out: \u201cThere is such a bomb. I\u2019m working on it.\u201d\n\nIn Moscow, the Soviets quickly set up a lab run by the scientist Igor Kurchatov to try to develop the bomb first. Kurchatov immediately saw that his team needed aid \u2014 that is, espionage from the United States. The deputy intelligence chief Leonid Kvasnikov was sent to the New York office to lead the effort, and once there, he helped establish a connection to Julius Rosenberg.\n\nImage\n\nBy the time Lamphere began working with him, Gardner had already found one important clue. It was a code name \u2014 \u201cLib?? (Lieb?) or possibly LIBERAL\u201d or \u201cANTENNA.\u201d Gardner noted that a message of Nov. 27, 1944, \u201cspeaks of his wife ETHEL, 29 years old.\u201d\n\nWith that, Gardner and Lamphere were off and running, and after months of grueling decoding work they were confident that they had uncovered a Soviet spy network put together by Julius Rosenberg. Eventually, both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested and sentenced to death.\n\nBlum says that Lamphere and Gardner both \u201cknew beyond any doubt the wrongness of Ethel Rosenberg\u2019s death sentence,\u201d and he concludes his book by describing a reunion years later when the two men supposedly expressed regret that Ethel\u2019s execution could not have been stopped. Today, students of the case all agree that her involvement was only peripheral, and that her execution was unwarranted. Nonetheless, various Soviet archives do show that she urged her sister-in-law Ruth to recruit her husband, David Greenglass, into Julius\u2019s circle and that she also provided names to the Russians of those she thought were potential recruits.

She has written at length about Sylvia Plath, Hannah Arendt and Marilyn Monroe, as well as several books on Zionism and the conflict in the Middle East. Her specialties are personalities and philosophies that attract (sometimes court) extreme idealization and revulsion. These larger-than-life figures bear our projections and our fears, she says, and allow us to maintain a fantasy of innocence in our own lives.\n\nHow appropriate, then, is this turn to motherhood \u2014 that site in the culture \u201cwhere we lodge, or rather bury, the reality of our own conflicts, of what it means to be fully human,\u201d Rose writes. \u201cIt is the ultimate scapegoat for our personal and political failings, for everything that is wrong with the world, which it becomes the task \u2014 unrealizable, of course \u2014 of mothers to repair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese aren\u2019t original points; this scapegoat argument in particular is one that has been made about every minority group you can imagine (it\u2019s also the premise of Toni Morrison\u2019s superb \u201cPlaying in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination\u201d).

She quotes Julia Kristeva: \u201cTo be a mother, to give birth, is to welcome a foreigner, which makes mothering simply \u2018the most intense form of contact with the strangeness of the one close to us and of ourselves.\u2019\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it pretty to think so? Recent books on motherhood, however, frequently and sometimes unwittingly, illustrate a different phenomenon: how motherhood dissolves the border of the self but shores up, often violently, the walls between classes of women.\n\n\u201cSome problems we share as women, some we do not,\u201d Audre Lorde wrote in an essay addressed to white feminists in 1984. \u201cYou fear your children will grow up to join the patriarchy and testify against you, we fear our children will be dragged from a car and shot down in the street, and you will turn your backs upon the reasons they are dying.\u201d\n\nRose acknowledges this issue: \u201cSolidarity among mothers, across class and ethnic boundaries, is not something Western cultures seem in any hurry to promote.\u201d But so many of these books (almost all of them are by white, middle-class women) seem wary of, if not outright disinterested in, more deeply engaging with how race and class inflect the experience of motherhood. Thrillers and horror, the genres that serve as our cultural unconscious, are left to pick up the slack; \u201cmom thrillers\u201d so often hinge on the anxieties of child care and racial privilege.\n\nThese omissions are especially troubling because the rift between mothers is only growing. The fastest growing pay gap is between black women and white women. And research shows that regardless of class, black mothers and babies are more than twice as likely to die than their white counterparts \u2014 a gulf that has grown since slavery, and which researchers attribute to the lifelong stresses of enduring racism.\n\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d the author of every new book on motherhood asks us. We should \u2014 and how could we not? Each testimony is valuable. But it\u2019s with a strange pleasure that the reader will realize that so many of the taboos these writers hope to shatter \u2014 about the ambivalence of motherhood, for example \u2014 are, by now, familiar.

And in the middle, serving as a liaison to the art world, is the longtime New Yorker Gardy St. Fleur.\n\nPhoto\n\nBorn in Port-au-Prince, St. Fleur grew up with art as a central part of his life. His father collected Haitian masters and commissioned work for local artists. His family moved to Brooklyn when he was a child, and St. Fleur spent his adolescence and early adulthood learning from artists. He befriended Ionel Talpazan, the New York City artist famous for painting extraterrestrial life, worked as a studio manager for Villalongo and, he said, regularly grabbed coffee with Emmanuel Benador, an art dealer.\n\nAnd he became just as interested in the artists as in their work.\n\n\u201cWhy do they do the things that they do?\u201d he said. \u201cFascinated with the way they think. As I get more information from them, I gravitate closer and closer to them. That helps me understand a little more.\u201d\n\nAfter a job out of college working in e-commerce, St. Fleur decided to follow his passion. Villalongo introduced him to Peggy Cooper Cafritz, who had a prestigious African-American art collection, and she gave him an assignment: Help her find new artists who were finishing graduate school.\n\nNot long afterward, he decided to push into the art business full time. And from there came his involvement in the N.B.A. ecosystem, a relationship built in part from the days when St. Fleur would hang around the Rucker Park and West Fourth Street basketball courts in Manhattan, meeting people who eventually became player agents. Getting to know Deron Williams, the former Nets guard, became fruitful, too. Williams was looking to build an art collection, not just acquire a few pieces.\n\nSo St. Fleur got involved, and soon his name began to hopscotch around the league.\n\nHe has worked with Houston Rockets forward P. J. Tucker, Hall of Famer Alonzo Mourning and Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia, among others, he said. Knicks guard Courtney Lee was connected with him through the team, St. Fleur said, after he had previously built a relationship with Carmelo Anthony, the former Knicks star. N.B.A. veteran Dahntay Jones started talking to St. Fleur about art while he was working out at Manhattan\u2019s Sky gym last summer, where Anthony held his popular \u201cHoodie Melo\u201d scrimmages.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He introduces athletes to artists, trying to break through the intimidation that affects some players. St. Fleur sends out newsletters to enlighten players, ships books to display different artists and styles, and texts photos of works to players if he believes one or more of them might be interested. Sometimes, he\u2019s there to caution a player against overpaying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou don\u2019t need millions to buy art, he often says.\n\nWhen Jay-Z released his latest album, \u201c4:44,\u201d St. Fleur was flooded with text messages. A song, \u201cThe Story of O. J.,\u201d with its references to buying artwork, had served as a jolt to some players, reinforcing what St. Fleur had been telling them for years: that art can also be an investment and a way for generations to create something to pass down.\n\n\u201cWhen guys start understanding the history of families collecting,\u201d St. Fleur said, \u201cmaybe it can be bigger than sports and who I am.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis evolution all took a while. In the mid-1990s, when Perry was in the middle of his N.B.A. career, he was virtually alone as he started his collection.\n\nHe had turned to art almost by accident. In 1996, Perry was seated next to Darrell Walker, the former Knicks guard, on a long flight to Japan for an exhibition tour led by Charles Barkley. Walker asked him if he knew anything about art.\n\nHe did not.\n\nThe next season, Walker began helping Perry explore. When Perry came to New York, Walker called with instructions on which gallery to visit. When he went to Boston, Walker recommended a studio. Perry got to be so insatiable that he would arrive in a new city, drop his bags in his hotel room and go studio-hopping to find new works. He began reading, too, learning about Renaissance artists and American painters who emerged in the 1930s with the support of the federal Works Progress Administration.\n\nStill, it took a year until Perry was comfortable enough to buy his first piece. Entering the art world had been overwhelming.\n\nAt first, Perry built a collection from works by African-American artists. Motivated by a quote in a catalog he had received at a showing of works owned by Walter O. Evans, a renowned African-American collector, Perry later decided to purchase only work from artists he could meet in person, get to know and support. He called Walker the day he decided to take that approach.\n\n\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d said Perry, who is now a limited partner and executive with the Memphis Grizzlies. \u201cEven though you have the resources, that doesn\u2019t mean anything. You still want to take your time. You want to buy the right pieces. You\u2019re going to make some mistakes, but that\u2019s part of the journey.\u201d\n\nThe heightened interest in art from N.B.A. players would seem to dovetail with their increased influence on American culture. And it has made art something of a conversation starter in N.B.A. locker rooms, where, not long ago, Lee, Michael Beasley and Jarrett Jack of the Knicks were discussing kre8artafax, an artist they discovered on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a basketball player,\u201d Dahntay Jones said of kre8artafax. \u201cHe feels something every time he starts painting, so that\u2019s just passion in its purest form.

Warped wooden floorboards creak under my feet, and exposed pipes and electrical wiring line the unfinished hallway. It smells of paint and turpentine. The contrast to the sleek, granite-floored lobby is striking. \u201cThey\u2019re renovating the building in the most absurd way, floor-by-floor,\u201d she explains good-naturedly. \u201cEventually I\u2019m getting kicked out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a few weeks before Puckette\u2019s upcoming show, \u201cNew Work,\u201d at Paul Kasmin Gallery, and I expect to interrupt the artist in somewhat of a frenzied state, paint-spattered and anxious. Instead, she is serene. Dressed neatly in a short white skirt and red V-neck sweater (not, she confirms, her painting clothes), her blonde hair in a French twist and a silk scarf knotted around her neck, Puckette looks more like a gallery owner than an artist. She has the erect posture and gently turned out feet of a ballet dancer and, as we enter her studio, the air of a straight-A student who finished the assignment long ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nPuckette has good reason to be at ease. This is her eighth solo show with Kasmin, which first exhibited her work shortly after she earned her B.F.A. from Cooper Union in 1989. \u201cHe has been very good to me all these years,\u201d she says of the dealer, \u201cand he knows to just leave me alone.\u201d\n\nA bit like her top-floor studio, which has resisted the insistent creep of luxury Brooklyn redevelopment, Puckette makes paintings today much like she did 25 years ago. She layers her large-scale square and rectangular boards with thick coats of gesso. Initially, she made the gesso herself from rabbit-skin glue and whiting, a traditional method she learned while studying old master techniques at Cooper. When this recipe started to affect her asthma, she developed her own variation using white kaolin clay. Once the surface has hardened, she applies a translucent wash of ink \u2014 lately, in muted shades of gray, black-blue and very deep purple. \u201cI have a weird relationship with color,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s always sort of an afterthought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt top of mind has always been the line, Puckette\u2019s career-long fascination. She doesn\u2019t know, she says, why it intrigues her. But more than color or form, the line is both central formal element and subject \u2014 mapped out with chalk and then painstakingly etched into the surface of her pieces with a single-edge razor blade.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI always start on the upper left-hand corner,\u201d says Puckette, \u201cas if I was writing.\u201d We\u2019re standing with our faces inches from \u201cLove Letter,\u201d a 15-foot-long triptych that is the largest piece in the upcoming show. A tangle of wavering, looping marks wends its way across the three panels. To demonstrate, Puckette scoops up a stray razor from the floor (\u201cI tried to clean up!\u201d) and begins lightly scratching at a section of line.

The state is becoming more urban and less white. \u201cIt should be as reliably blue as California,\u201d Wright says. \u201cInstead, it is the Red Planet in the political universe.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWright rattles off the familiar stereotypes: \u201ccowboy individualism, a kind of wary friendliness, superpatriotism combined with defiance of all government authority, a hair-trigger sense of grievance, nostalgia for an ersatz past that is largely an artifact of Hollywood.\u201d He concedes they\u2019re all true. But they\u2019re not all there is. \u201cGod Save Texas\u201d also depicts \u201ca culture that is still raw, not fully formed, standing on the margins but also growing in influence, dangerous and magnificent in its potential.\u201d\n\nThe book rambles far and wide, and it\u2019s a testament to Wright\u2019s formidable storytelling skills that a reader will encounter plenty of information without ever feeling lost. A bride and groom emerging from a chapel leads to a disquisition on the Spanish conquistadors and the explorer Cabeza de Vaca; a chapter on Texas radio turns into a discussion of Texas gun laws and a consideration of Texas snakes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt sometimes seems that every living thing can bite or poke or sting or shoot you,\u201d Wright says of the state where he lives.

Wright recalls the 2016 video of Sen. Ted Cruz wrapping a strip of bacon around the barrel of an AR-15, pulling the trigger, peeling the bacon off the smoking gun and eating it with a plastic fork. \u201cThe object of the video apparently was to show a jollier and more human side of the candidate,\u201d he writes, knowing he doesn\u2019t have to say more than that; the senator, the bacon and the gun have done all the work.\n\nBut the book isn\u2019t only about current affairs, and Wright \u2014 who was born in Oklahoma and moved to Abilene, Tex., as a child in the 1950s \u2014 weaves in his own intimate history with the state. He fled Texas after high school, doing \u201ceverything I could to cleanse myself of its influence.\u201d\n\nThat influence included its long shadow of racism. In 1845, the bankrupt Texas Republic chose to be annexed by the United States as a slave state; the alternative was a bailout from the British, which would have preserved Texas\u2019s independence but required it to switch to a system of non-slave wage labor. Texas, at this crossroad and others, chose slavery every time.\n\nWright has ancestors who fought for the Confederacy. In Abilene, he kept a portrait of General Robert E. Lee on his bedroom wall. He would later cover the civil rights movement for The Race Relations Reporter in Nashville. \u201cI still feel ashamed of the prejudices that I struggled to shed,\u201d he writes. He doesn\u2019t say much here about that struggle, though in his 1987 memoir, \u201cIn the New World,\u201d he explores his Texas upbringing with vulnerability and candor.\n\nSince returning to Texas in 1980, Wright has lived in Austin, the state capital that serves as a scapegoat for state lawmakers, who routinely attack the city in showy attempts to establish their conservative bona fides. They\u2019re almost as fixated on Austin as they are on California. To them, as Wright puts it, \u201cAustin is a spore of the California fungus that is destroying America.\u201d\n\nWright doesn\u2019t counter the moral panic with moral panic. His tone is gentle, occasionally chiding, and he seems most comfortable in the center lane, allowing the road hogs to pass by while he holds steady at the wheel.\n\nCertain readers might crave more righteous anger from someone writing about Texas, especially now, when there\u2019s little room for agreement and plenty at stake. But Wright\u2019s project is perspective, not conquest. In a chapter on Texas culture, he praises the work of contemporary artists who have returned to their Texas roots \u201cwith knowledge, self-confidence, and occasionally, forgiveness.\u201d \u201cGod Save Texas\u201d is his vivid bid to do the same.", "title": "In \u2018God Save Texas,\u2019 Lawrence Wright Ranges Far and Wide", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}

She thought being surrounded by ancient marine specimens might be generative when it came to discussing her new novel, \u201cThe Pisces.\u201d\n\nThe book, due out May 1, tells the story of a catatonically depressed woman named Lucy, also 38, who slumps around modern-day Venice Beach, Calif., aimless and alone. Unable to complete her dissertation on Sappho and dazed after a messy breakup, Lucy agrees to dog-sit for her sister who lives near the beach, hoping the brackish Pacific breeze might enliven her spirits. Instead, she gets the itch to toss herself into the ocean. One night, she crawls onto a jagged rock jutting out into the sea foam, but before she can jump into the waves, she meets a comely young surfer. His name is Theo, and soon the two are meeting regularly under the stars \u2014 she on the rock, he always bobbing in the ocean. Lucy begins to wonder why she has never seen him out of the water, or even from the waist down. Then, the truth emerges: Theo is a merman. Yes, an actual merman, with flippers, who has been alive for centuries. The love between a human woman and a sea-bound man echoes the plotline of the recent Oscar-winning film \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d but Ms. Broder infuses her narrative with a sardonic, youthful twist.\n\nIt made sense, then, that Ms. Broder would want to meet underneath a gargantuan sea creature as she was passing through town. She currently lives in Los Angeles \u2014 with her husband and a rescue dog named Pickle \u2014 but she was determined for us to have an oceanic adventure. Unfortunately, we could only view the leviathan from behind a velvet rope at the museum, as a private event was in progress. As we walked through the beige hallways filled with artifacts, Ms. Broder\u2019s sense of humor began to emerge. \u201cAt least you can say we got whale adjacent,\u201d she said, as we strolled through the dioramas of African mammals.\n\nAnyone already familiar with her work as a poet and essayist would not be shocked to find that Ms. Broder radiates an immediate, cozy candor. In 2012, then living in New York and working as a book publicist at Penguin, she started an anonymous Twitter account called So Sad Today. While she had been publishing poetry for years under her own name, she decided to hide behind an avatar so that she could have an unfettered medium through which to confront her anxieties at a safe distance. On the account she posts crystalline koans about depression and self-doubt (sample tweets: \u201cmy thighs have never not touched\u201d; \u201cin a threesome with anxiety and depression\u201d). It quickly grew into a viral sensation, with over half a million followers and a book deal with Grand Central Publishing.\n\nIn order to do a press tour for \u201cSo Sad Today,\u201d her frank, sly book of essays from 2016 about mental health, internet addiction and the complexities of female friendship, she decided to reveal herself in an interview with Rolling Stone. \u201cI was like, \u2018Am I ever going to be respected as a poet again?\u2019\u201d she told Rolling Stone about coming clean. Instead, she garnered even more praise, becoming something of an overnight folk hero to women who felt isolated in their darkest insecurities. \u201cBroder\u2019s essays often left me with a sharp sense of feminine recognition,\u201d the writer Haley Mlotek wrote on The New Yorker\u2019s website. \u201cI would read her accounts of heartbreak, sexual dissatisfaction, and alienation and think, Same.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe topics that interest me are the things that have been going on for a really long time and are universal to all humans,\u201d Ms. Broder tells me over a light lunch (we were, of course, eating fish; I had salmon, she ordered branzino). \u201cWe\u2019re all born, we all die, a lot \u2014 most, many \u2014 of us fall in love, many of us have sex.

Though Paul was short on money and didn\u2019t travel to Nashville for the special session, she dispatched the native Tennessean Sue Shelton White, an activist who could, with her very accent, dispel accusations about meddling outsiders. Weiss depicts another native daughter of Tennessee, this one a committed Anti: Josephine Pearson, who presided over multiple Anti groups and believed that in fighting against ratification, she was obeying both God and her deceased mother.\n\nWeiss is a clear and genial guide with an ear for telling language (\u201cI\u2019d rather see my daughter in a coffin than at the polls,\u201d declares one Anti, while a newspaper headline about a pretty, young Suff reads \u201c110 Pounds of Femininity to Hit Legislators for Vote\u201d). She also shows a superb sense of detail, and it\u2019s the deliciousness of her details that suggests certain individuals warrant entire novels of their own.\n\nFor example, Annie Nathan Meyer and Maud Nathan, New York sisters, were respectively an Anti and a Suff, who didn\u2019t speak to each other except when \u201cclashing publicly.\u201d Luke Lea, the swaggering publisher of a Nashville newspaper, a onetime senator and a member of the Men\u2019s Ratification Committee, had concocted a plan to kidnap Kaiser Wilhelm after the armistice. He abandoned the kidnapping attempt, returned to Nashville and married his dead wife\u2019s sister. Or how about Louisine Havemeyer, a grandmother who lived in a Fifth Avenue mansion in New York and used her fortune, acquired via her sugar magnate husband, to support Suff radicals and who once found herself, by design, in jail?

Because of the number of major players, it can become hard to remember who is who. There\u2019s also a somewhat awkward structure to the book in that almost everything before Page 219 is back story, and in places, the back story has a back story. Routinely, a person is depicted in a specific moment \u2014 the governor of Tennessee is donning a jacket, say \u2014 then there are several pages of history before rejoining the governor, who is still donning his jacket. But storytelling, like democracy, is sometimes messy, and Weiss\u2019s thoroughness is one of the book\u2019s great strengths. So vividly had she depicted events that by the climactic vote (spoiler alert: The amendment was ratified!), I got goose bumps.\n\nI\u2019m almost certain that the name Hillary Rodham Clinton appears only once, in the last few pages. Yet it is, of course, impossible to read \u201cThe Woman\u2019s Hour\u201d without thinking of the 2016 presidential election, of the symbolic and literal impact of Clinton\u2019s candidacy, the consequences of her loss, the way she was and still is portrayed in the news media.

That closing, it turns out, was temporary: Here \u201cChicago\u201d is again, this time at the Phoenix Theater and with a newfound celebrity draw in the Oscar-winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (He and his fellow principals are contracted through June 30, with subsequent casting to be announced.)\n\nA relative theatrical neophyte with only one Broadway credit, Mr. Gooding might seem tailor-made for the assignment as the smooth-talking, press-savvy lawyer Billy Flynn. After all, he recently played O.J. Simpson in a TV mini-series whose depiction of the media circus that can be made out of the American justice system is directly prefigured by this musical\u2019s portrait of two murderous chorus girls, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, in 1920s Chicago.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Gooding is the least satisfying aspect of a reboot that otherwise finds Walter Bobbie\u2019s decades-old production in shape, with every swiveled hip calibrated to within an inch of the finely drilled ensemble\u2019s lives. Playing the Windy City\u2019s leading criminal lawyer in a tabloid-happy era seemingly not that different from our own, Mr. Gooding isn\u2019t called upon to dance much, and he just about survives the vocal demands of John Kander and Fred Ebb\u2019s score. More than once, you hold your breath to see if the gravelly-voiced performer will hit, and hold, the necessary note.\n\nThere are no such doubts when it comes to Mr. Gooding\u2019s colleagues, many of whom have appeared in the show before \u2014 and, in the case of Ruthie Henshall, in varying roles, as well. London\u2019s original Roxie, Ms. Henshall later played Velma and has now graduated to the smaller, if choice, part of the prison warden Mama Morton, who partners with Velma on the song \u201cClass,\u201d a paean to a bygone age when manners \u2014 remember them? \u2014 were seen to matter.\n\nOf the two leading ladies, \u201cChicago\u201d veterans both, the Belgian performer Sarah Soetaert makes for an unusually hard-edged Roxie, the Kewpie-doll killer who believes in murder as \u201can art.\u201d You don\u2019t feel, as you do with the most memorable interpreters of this part, the tremulous self-discovery that overtakes Roxie as she joins Velma when showbiz gives them a second chance.\n\nVelma, Josefina Gabrielle, is a onetime Roxie who brings to her current assignment an age-defying physicality, doing a cartwheel and the splits in quick succession. Entirely at home in the shape-shifting demands of Ann Reinking\u2019s choreography, famously patterned after Bob Fosse\u2019s original moves, Ms. Gabrielle transmits the razzle dazzle that is the title of one of the score\u2019s best songs.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks the piece itself has dated, try this query on for size: \u201cAre you going to believe what you see or what I tell you?\u201d asks Roxie\u2019s woebegone victim, a cue straight from today\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d playbook.

It also complicates efforts by those believers to get military, police or civil service jobs, or even burial plots in cemeteries.\n\nThere are hundreds of different forms of aliran kepercayaan spread across the vast Indonesian archipelago. In Java, the most populous island, it is often a mix of animist, Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic beliefs.\n\nForms of kepercayaan can include certain periodic religious observances, such as communal meals or acts that could be compared to Muslim men praying together on Fridays or Sunday Christian services. These may include ritual offerings to appease spirits, even though the practitioners could also be registered as Muslims, Catholics, Buddhists or one of the other recognized religions.\n\nIt is estimated that at least 20 million of Indonesia\u2019s 260 million people practice local traditional beliefs, but the numbers could be much higher, according to analysts, as some are also followers of Islam, Christianity and other major religions.\n\nReligion is so omnipresent in Indonesia that citizens are required to declare on their national ID cards which of the six approved religions they adhere to, though in some regions they are allowed to leave that section blank. However, doing so can invite discrimination and bureaucratic hassles, so many traditional believers simply state on their ID cards the religion that is dominant in the area where they live. In Java, it is likely to be Muslim, but in parts of the islands of Sumatra or Sulawesi, it could be Catholic or Protestant, while on Bali it would be Hindu.\n\nBut such workarounds should be unnecessary, some legal experts say.\n\n\u201cThe court decision underlines that freedom of belief is a constitutional right, not a right that is given by the government,\u201d said Bivitri Susanti, head of the Jakarta chapter of the Indonesian Association of Constitutional Law Lecturers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSecond, it states that the right to belief in aliran kepercayaan, or faiths other than the six government-recognized religions, is inherent with the rights to religion as stated in Article 29 of the Indonesian Constitution,\u201d she added.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut clouding that point of view is the fact that about 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, giving Islamic religious leaders outsize political clout. The Indonesia Ulema Council, the country\u2019s top body of clerics, has been adamant, for example, that traditional beliefs should not be seen as on par with Islam.\n\n\u201cThe Constitutional Court ruling was not considered carefully and hurt the feelings of the faithful, especially Indonesian Muslims, because the ruling has placed aliran kepercayaan as equals,\u201d said Zainut Tauhid Sa\u2019adi, the council\u2019s vice chairman.\n\n\u201cThe decision has legal consequences and an impact on our society,\u201d he said.\n\nSome hard-line Islamic groups want to go even further and change the Constitution to make Islam the official state religion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

No permanent resistance mutations have emerged in any bacteria.\n\nSuch mutations \u201care more of a concern in I.C.U.\u2019s in New York City than in places like Niger, where\u2019s there such low access to antibiotics,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach year, when azithromycin is given out, some pneumococcal bacteria resistant to it appear, said Paul Emerson, the trachoma initiative\u2019s director. But those strains fade out within weeks or months, he said.\n\nAlso, he noted, the resistance is only to macrolides, the drug class to which azithromycin belongs. Macrolides are not heavily used in Africa, where W.H.O. guidelines still recommend penicillins and even older sulfa drugs because they are cheap and effective.\n\nPharmaceutical supply chains in some poor countries are plagued by theft, and antibiotics are tempting targets because they cure sexually transmitted diseases and other ills. But less than 1 percent of Pfizer\u2019s donations have been lost to theft or expiration, Dr. Emerson said.\n\nFor enhanced security, azithromycin is distributed in special purple packaging saying it is to be used only for trachoma.

As children, Grace and Lena would watch with awed fascination whenever their mother dressed up to go to a party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis ambivalence deepens Ms. Simmons\u2019s art and keeps it from falling into simplistic agitprop. \u201cLaurie\u2019s work doesn\u2019t only look prescient, it looks current,\u201d said Madeleine Grynsztejn, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, which will host a Simmons retrospective next year, following its opening at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in October. \u201cThe work has a way of touching cross-generationally on the construction of femininity, feminine sexuality and the role of women in today\u2019s world. It walks this very fine line between being playful and searing.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A fateful jump came in 2005-6, with the making of a 45-minute musical film, \u201cThe Music of Regret,\u201d that gave movement and narrative to the dummies of her photographs. Meryl Streep (part of Ms. Simmons\u2019s wide-reaching network of friends) wore a black wig to portray the artist, and interacted with different avatars of the male ventriloquist dummy.\n\nAn off-kilter hybrid, \u201cThe Music of Regret\u201d is only partly successful, but it kick-started Ms. Simmons\u2019s dormant cinematic ambitions. After being on her mother\u2019s set, Lena Dunham wanted to make a movie, too: the result was \u201cTiny Furniture,\u201d produced for $50,000. In it, Ms. Simmons played an artist who photographs miniature dollhouse scenes. The movie tracks with emotional accuracy what was happening in Lena\u2019s life at the time. One place that Ms. Simmons saw room for expansion and improvement was its depiction of her character, a midcareer woman artist.\n\n\u201cMy Art,\u201d which was made on a budget of roughly $400,000, aims at a more multifaceted portrayal. Ms. Simmons plays a woman, stalled in her personal life and artistic career, who spends a month in a borrowed country house to regenerate. It is the artist\u2019s passion for her work, not some halfhearted romance, that pulls her through.\n\n\u201c\u2018My Art\u2019 is the most accurate depiction of an artist\u2019s life I\u2019ve seen,\u201d the painter and writer David Salle said in an email. \u201cLaurie managed to catch the complexity, the loneliness and near-absurdity of it, as well as the tenderness.\u201d\n\nMs. Simmons shot most of \u201cMy Art\u201d at her brick Colonial Revival house in Connecticut. \u201cI always say I\u2019m an artist with the soul of a realtor,\u201d she quipped. She knew she wanted to buy and renovate the dilapidated former school as soon as she saw it in 2005, but it took \u201ctwo years of nonstop convincing\u201d to win over her husband.\n\nEven more courageous was the move into a new art form. \u201cOnce artists get into a specific lane it can be very difficult for them to make the choice to get out of it,\u201d Lena Dunham said. \u201cI was deeply impressed by her motivation and by her passion \u2014 and by the final product.\u201d\n\nMaking the movie was also a way for Ms. Simmons to deal with a succession of heartbreaking losses that began with the sudden death in June 2013 of her close friend the artist Sarah Charlesworth, and continued, over the span of little more than a year, with the deaths of her nephew, brother-in-law and mother. \u201cWhen I got the call that Sarah had died, there was complete shock and also the thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to make my movie,\u2019\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cThe movie supplanted grief.\u201d\n\nShe was pivoting away from dolls and dummies to photograph human models, in what has been a gradual, jerky transition. \u201cThe whole idea of finding something in someone that is the essence of them, that looking for something, I never understood before,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHaving observed Japanese \u201cdollers,\u201d who as a form of \u201ccosplay\u201d (costume play) paint their closed eyelids to resemble the wide-open eyes of Barbies or anime figures, Ms. Simmons made a sequence of portraits she called \u201cHow We See,\u201d in 2015. Her photographs depict young women who appear preternaturally attentive. The simulated eyes are so convincing that on first glance, you recognize only that there is something weirdly soulless about them, as beautifully vacant as Stepford wives.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs a way station between dolls and real women, \u201cHow We See\u201d led to the current portraits at Salon 94 of people (and a dog) who are all close to Ms. Simmons, and are seen naked emotionally and, in some instances, physically. Even to her family, the directness of the portraits came as a surprise.\n\n\u201cMy mom processes her emotions through her art,\u201d Grace Dunham said. \u201cIn some ways, her emotions have been mysterious to me. They have been interior. Her work is potentially the most intimate part of her life.\u201d\n\nThe other work in the Salon 94 show, \u201cThe Mess,\u201d attests to Ms. Simmons\u2019s longstanding love affair with plastic. In a 20-foot-long photographic print, accompanied by a drone video, she depicts an assemblage of cheap disposable household items arranged by color. \u201cIt\u2019s a rainbow gradient mess,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn a shopping day, she would go with an assistant and buy merchandise in a designated Day-Glo hue, and lay it all out on the floor of the barn. Over it, she displayed the numerals \u201c2017,\u201d a year in which she addressed the health problems of one daughter and the gender transition of another, along with the political fallout of an election that she said horrified everyone she knew.\n\nYet while \u201cThe Mess\u201d is undeniably a mess it is also luridly gorgeous. \u201cPlastic has been such an incredibly key part of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cI treat it like marble and light it and make it look beautiful and luxurious. For me, it still has that kind of beauty, which is a surface beauty with a toxicity underneath.\u201d\n\nShe might say the same of the trappings of traditional femininity. On that contradiction rests Ms. Simmons\u2019s unsettling art.", "title": "Influenced by Her Children, Laurie Simmons Exits Her Comfort Zone", "authors": ["Arthur Lubow"]}

Prescribing rates for opioids are still strikingly high, and the overdose death rate in Roane County, where Ms. Whitefield lives, is three times the national average. Jobs go unfilled here because, employers say, applicants often cannot pass a drug test.\n\nAcross Tennessee, some 163,000 poor adults remain uninsured after state lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. For them, and even for many covered by Medicaid, as Ms. Whitefield is, evidence-based opioid addiction treatment remains meager. More common are cash-only clinics, or abstinence-based programs that bank on willpower instead of the addiction medications that have proved more effective.\n\nTreatment for endocarditis usually involves up to six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, often in the hospital because doctors are wary of sending addicted patients home with IV lines for fear they would use them to inject illicit drugs. Many, like Ms. Whitefield, also need intricate surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. The cost can easily top $150,000, Dr. Pollard said.\n\nAdvice from specialty groups, like the American Association for Thoracic Surgery and the American College of Cardiology, about when to operate remains vague. For now, \u201cit\u2019s just a lot of anecdote \u2014 surgeons talking to each other, trying to determine when we should and when we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Carlo Martinez, who is one of Dr. Pollard\u2019s partners and who operated on Ms. Whitefield at Methodist Medical Center of Oak Ridge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTheir practice, owned by Covenant Health, will almost always operate on someone with a first-time case of endocarditis from injecting drugs, Dr. Pollard said. But repeat infections, when the damage can be more extensive and harder to fix, make it a tougher call. Dr. Mark Browne, Covenant\u2019s senior vice president and chief medical officer, said, \u201cEach patient is evaluated individually and decisions regarding the appropriate course of care are determined by their attending physician.\u201d\n\nIn the nearly two years since she got sick, Ms. Whitefield has felt physically diminished and been prone to illness. She also feels harshly judged by a medical system that saved her life but often treats her with suspicion and disdain.\n\nOver the same stretch of time, Dr. Pollard has grown increasingly disillusioned with hospitals that consider addiction treatment beyond their purview, and haunted by the likelihood that many of his drug-addicted patients will die young whether they get heart surgery or not. He set up a task force in 2016 to address the problem but has faced obstacles, especially concerning cost and, he believes, a societal reluctance to spend money on people who abuse drugs.\n\n\u201cEverybody has sympathy for babies and children,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to help the adult drug addict because the thought is they did this to themselves.\u201d", "title": "Injecting Drugs Can Ruin a Heart.

She hopes to pursue an advanced degree in the field someday, but during her time off, she read books on the topic and emphasized it in corporate speaking engagements.\n\n\u201cI was speaking in front of companies and also the tennis federation, different kinds of audiences about psychological subjects,\u201d Siegemund said. \u201cOf course it was from the perspective of a professional athlete, but I tried to take it a little further, transferring what we experience on the court. I think you can transfer it to any area of life and business. I kind of liked that, to give my perspective on these things.\u201d\n\nSiegemund\u2019s undergraduate thesis focused on a topic intrinsic to her life as a tennis player: choking under pressure. She says her expertise in the area does not necessarily protect her from collapsing.\n\n\u201cIt does help me to have extra knowledge, but being able to apply it in these situations is a whole different thing,\u201d she said. \u201cTheory and practice are two completely different things. But it\u2019s good to have the theory to try to apply it.\u201d\n\nOn court, Siegemund is known as a dogged competitor with a ruthlessness that often unnerves her opponents.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think part of her game is to find out how to irritate the other person a little bit,\u201d said Naomi Osaka, a recent opponent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSiegemund said she had applied some of that same relentlessness to her rehabilitation process.\n\n\u201cI drive the people around me crazy sometimes because I\u2019m very impatient, and if it\u2019s not going forward, I can be a hard one to deal with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m getting up at 7, and I\u2019m the first one to go in the place and the last one to go out.

She lost in the second round to Osaka, the recent Indian Wells champion, after holding four set points in the second set.\n\nSiegemund feels confident in her knee, she said, but still wears a large brace on her right leg for some physical and mental reassurance.\n\n\u201cI do want to take it off,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very pretty, it\u2019s really ugly. Maybe a shout-out to all the people that make braces, maybe they can do something nice instead of this.\u201d\n\nSiegemund, who notched five wins against top-10 players on clay last year, said she did not dwell on what might have been during her recovery, even though the French Open yielded many upsets, including the championship victory by an unseeded Jelena Ostapenko.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on that hypothetical trip so much,\u201d Siegemund said. \u201cWhat happened to me, I had to deal with it. I saw it as a task I had to manage, and I think that helped me to get through all of it in a positive way, and really come back stronger, a little bit, from it.\u201d\n\nSiegemund\u2019s next tournament will be next week in Stuttgart, where last year she won her second WTA title. In addition to the trophy and prize money, Siegemund earned a car from Porsche, the title sponsor of the event. The company did a custom paint job in \u201cfrozen berry,\u201d a color that Siegemund described as purplish taupe, and by the time the car was finished, its owner could not bend her knee enough to get in.\n\nSiegemund said she was not putting pressure on herself to succeed quickly, but she has not dimmed her expectations after returning to tour as what she considers a better-rounded player and person, while still hungry for on-court success.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be where I was before \u2014 I want to be better than that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe in a different way.\u201d", "title": "Injured in Tennis, She Put Her Psychology Degree to Use", "authors": ["Ben Rothenberg"]}

It could have been a lot worse.\u201d\n\nThe Mets estimate a three- to four-week absence, but in any case, as injuries go, these seem tolerable. D\u2019Arnaud and Plawecki have combined to hit .171 this season, with one home run and four runs batted in.\n\nThe Mets cannot go back in time and sign Jonathan Lucroy, the two-time All-Star catcher who lingered on the market until taking a one-year, $6.5 million deal from Oakland on March 12. But these injuries might motivate them to find a more reliable everyday option than d\u2019Arnaud, who has a .306 career on-base percentage.\n\nOr maybe Lobaton and Nido will be strong enough defensively that the Mets will just live with their bats. Both worked with the pitchers in spring training, and Lobaton, at least, can claim a highlight few have experienced: a game-ending postseason home run. He connected in a division series for Tampa Bay in 2013, and did so with a flourish, the ball splashing into a tank of live rays beyond center field.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLobaton later reached the playoffs twice with Washington, so he is used to game-planning for elite starting pitchers and familiar with a winning atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in with a team that\u2019s 1-10, it\u2019s way different than 10-1,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I know the energy, I know what it\u2019s like when the clubhouse feels good.

But for now, all of these carefully nurtured arms are actually healthy and contributing in the rotation or the bullpen: Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Steven Matz, Zack Wheeler, Robert Gsellman, Seth Lugo and Jeurys Familia.\n\nHistory suggests that will not hold up.

Mr. de Blasio became the younger Cuomo\u2019s point man in his home state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cuomo had worked the phones to get Mr. de Blasio, then a rising star in New York politics, to take the job.\n\n\u201cHe would say to them, \u2018Tell Bill this is why he should do this job and why it\u2019s important to his career,\u2019\u201d recalled Karen Hinton, who worked for Mr. Cuomo at HUD and later served as Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary in City Hall.\n\nPhoto\n\nPeople who worked with them at the time, and others who have spoken with Mr. Cuomo in the years since, said he found Mr. de Blasio to be politically sharp but not particularly substantive. Others say even then Mr. de Blasio displayed a more ideologically leftward bent than his boss.\n\n\u201cI was proud to work for him,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said recently of his tenure.\n\nThey were definitely seen as a pair.\n\nIn late 1999, when Mr. Cuomo\u2019s department declared that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani could not be trusted to fairly dole out millions in federal funding for the New York City homeless, Republicans immediately suspected collusion \u2014 between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, who was then Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager.\n\n\u201cIt seems like Cuomo and de Blasio are still working together,\u201d a Republican official said at the time.\n\nBy 2002, when Mr. Cuomo embarked on his quixotic bid for the governor\u2019s mansion by challenging Mr. McCall, widely seen as the Democratic heir apparent and potentially the state\u2019s first black governor, Mr. de Blasio was among his few backers.\n\n\u201cYou could have gotten all of his supporters into a phone booth,\u201d Mr. de Blasio joked recently.\n\nBut their bond, even then, appeared to many as one of political convenience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFriends might be a stretch,\u201d said John Marino, another emissary deployed by Mr. Cuomo in that 2002 weekend when he withdrew from the governor\u2019s race. \u201cThey both respected each other. There was no question Andrew respected what Bill thought, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nThey climbed the ladder of New York politics in parallel steps. Mr. de Blasio to the City Council in 2001; Mr. Cuomo to state attorney general in 2006; Mr. de Blasio to city public advocate in 2009; Mr. Cuomo to governor in 2010; Mr. de Blasio to mayor in 2013.\n\nThere was mutual respect, too. Matt Wing, who worked for Mr. de Blasio as public advocate and later for Mr. Cuomo as governor, still vividly recalls watching Mr. Cuomo\u2019s first budget address in 2011 over junk food with Mr. de Blasio.\n\n\u201cI remember Bill and I both being impressed and more than a little inspired,\u201d Mr. Wing recalled.\n\nWeeks after Mr. de Blasio\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2014, Mr. Cuomo proclaimed, \u201cI don\u2019t have a better political friend than Bill de Blasio.\u201d\n\nBut the problems to come were already apparent.\n\nOn the day that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s last Democratic opponent bowed out in September 2013 (Mr. Cuomo had not endorsed his friend until then), aides to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio nearly came to blows over the speaking order at a unity rally. It was meant to be Mr. de Blasio\u2019s day of triumph; Mr. Cuomo spoke longer.\n\nThe battle to be the alpha male of New York politics had only just begun.\n\nV for Vendetta\n\nThis is hardly Andrew Cuomo\u2019s first feud. He has quarreled with a parade of politicians in the last decade: Eliot L. Spitzer, David A. Paterson, Eric T. Schneiderman, Michael R. Bloomberg and Thomas P. DiNapoli. While he was HUD secretary in the 1990s, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s clash with the department\u2019s inspector general was legendary. Before that, he tossed sharp elbows professionally for his father in the 1980s.\n\nThose who have worked closely with the younger Mr. Cuomo over the years say he has a zero-sum approach to power, especially among Democrats in New York: The more anyone else has of it, the less there is for him.\n\nEnter Mr. de Blasio into a job where tensions between Albany and New York City have been longstanding, even among members of the same party. In the 1980s, it was Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, two Democrats. In the 1960s, it was Mayor John V. Lindsay and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, both Republican moderates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t be in the same room together,\u201d Sid Davidoff, a lobbyist who served in Mr. Lindsay\u2019s administration, said of his former boss and Mr. Rockefeller. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a public spectacle. Now it is.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Cuomo has a penchant for picking fights, Mr. de Blasio has a notoriously stubborn streak. Some early advisers gave up trying to even help him out of exhaustion of his obstinance. For example: his lonely trip to Iowa to canvass for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, which some top advisers counseled against; his daily 12-mile treks to a Park Slope gym.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s recalcitrance can make it difficult for him to walk away from fights with the governor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn some ways, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio are more alike than either would care to acknowledge: two ex-operatives who now serve as the principals themselves. They are demanding, if not difficult bosses. They operate with sometimes excruciatingly small circles of advisers, none of whom they seem to trust as much as themselves, often to a fault.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lot like Andrew,\u201d Mario Cuomo had said in 2009 when he endorsed Mr. de Blasio as public advocate.\n\nWhat both sides do agree upon is that the seeds of their split were planted in 2014, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first full year as mayor. They just cite different episodes.\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, it was the new mayor\u2019s insistence on pushing for a tax increase on millionaires.\n\nMr. de Blasio had just been elected on a platform to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund an extra year of prekindergarten \u2014 but New York\u2019s arcane political structure required him to go to Albany for approval.\n\nEven before the election, Mr. Cuomo had told Mr. de Blasio raising taxes was a nonstarter given Republican control of the State Senate but that he would provide money for the prekindergarten expansion, people briefed on those conversations said. But the freshly elected mayor told the governor that he would be publicly pushing for it anyway.\n\nMr. de Blasio saw it as fulfilling a key promise to voters. Mr. Cuomo first saw it as irksome, and eventually disrespectful, as the mayor rallied the governor\u2019s union allies to his cause.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere were competing rallies and hurt feelings. Eventually, the state approved money for prekindergarten without a tax increase.\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, the experience fueled a belief that he has voiced with escalating emphasis in recent months: Mr. de Blasio is more concerned with political rhetoric and talking points than practical results.\n\n\u201cThe job of government is to get things done for people. Not to issue press releases saying \u2018I propose doing this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at a recent Nycha stop, talking about the mayor without naming him.\n\nPeople close to the governor say Mr. de Blasio reminds Mr. Cuomo of what he sees as the failed liberal ideologues of the past.\n\n\u201cFor 40 years, Cuomo has consistently said that the prior generation of Democrats focused too much on poetry and not enough on the prose of governing,\u201d said Jon J. Cowan, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s chief of staff at HUD.\n\nBut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s allies have recently cited a different dividing point late that same year.\n\nWhen many New York City police officers turned their back on the mayor after the killing of two police officers in December 2014, Mr. Cuomo offered the mayor no support. Inside City Hall, the episode felt like an existential crisis for the administration and Mr. de Blasio had hoped that his old friend would be of some assistance, according to people in touch with him at the time.\n\nInstead Mr. Cuomo said he supported both the mayor and the police union chief, who had just said there was \u201cblood on the hands\u201d at City Hall.\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways for you to be both a responsible actor and a good friend and he did none of them in that moment,\u201d one person close to Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe relationship soured entirely in 2015. The governor shut down the subways during a snowstorm without first telling the mayor. The mayor did not give the governor\u2019s office a heads-up on plans to redevelop a rail yard in Queens, and the governor quickly squashed the idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy June, the governor was knifing the mayor through thinly cloaked anonymous interviews mocking him as \u201cMr. Progressive.\u201d Then, Mr. de Blasio went on television to deliver the kind of public broadside rarely seen between two members of the same political party, let alone old friends.\n\n\u201cIf someone disagrees with him openly,\u201d the mayor said, \u201csome kind of revenge or vendetta follows.\u201d\n\n\u201cVendetta,\u201d in particular, stuck in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s craw, people familiar with the episode said, in part because of its Mafia connotations in a fight between two men of Italian heritage.\n\nIt was notable, then, that on the day Ms. Nixon emerged as a likely challenger, a \u201cCuomo insider\u201d used the very same V-word to link Ms. Nixon to Mr. de Blasio in a statement to multiple news outlets.\n\n\u201cThis distraction is clearly an outgrowth of the mayor\u2019s vendetta against the governor,\u201d the insider said.\n\nIt was a clear message, especially for the two veterans of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s warring with Mr. Cuomo, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, who are now advising Ms. Nixon. In one of her first interviews, Ms. Nixon called Mr. Cuomo \u201cfamously vengeful.\u201d The echo reverberated loudly through the governor\u2019s chambers.\n\nPoint of No Return\n\nOf course, the mayor and the governor do talk, often by phone in calls that are hastily arranged via text message between the two leaders. Their calls are often not scheduled and, as such, aides are not always on the line or in the room, especially on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s end, according to a city person with direct knowledge of the routine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even when relations appear to momentarily improve \u2014 as after terrorist strikes \u2014 they quickly worsen again.\n\nFrom the perspective of City Hall, opinion has hardened that Mr. Cuomo can no longer be trusted, and some despair of trying to fight back. The state remains pre-eminent over most city affairs, a power the governor never shied from using: It is as if the mayor can only bring a knife and the governor avails himself of military artillery.\n\n\u201cThe mayor can\u2019t place a monitor on the governor\u2019s decrepit state prisons, or his failing upstate jobs programs, or on the water supply in Hoosick Falls,\u201d said Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary. \u201cNew York\u2019s governance structure makes this an uneven fight that would only get worse if you give in to a governor this obsessed with hurting New York City and a fellow Democrat.\u201d\n\nThat the state controls perhaps the city\u2019s greatest resource, its sprawling transit system, has set up a protracted battle over funding and responsibility as the subway system has faltered.\n\nThe mayor and his team have sought, indirectly, to lump Mr. Cuomo in with a group of old-line Democrats \u2014 the \u201cdescendent Democrats\u201d \u2014 facing challenges from what they see as the party\u2019s ascendant progressive wing.\n\nStill, Mr. Cuomo chafes at the primacy given New York City mayors in times of terrorism, those who know him say: The city is the target and the mayor controls the New York Police Department, and therefore access to information.\n\nMr. Cuomo had seen how Gov. George E. Pataki saw himself diminished by Mr. Giuliani after Sept. 11, 2001, and would not be similarly left in this mayor\u2019s shadow.\n\nAnd so, the governor deployed the State Police in the middle of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first term. \u201cThey never had uniformed guys patrolling in New York City,\u201d said a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the discussions. The move served no apparent policing need, the official said, and led to the departure of the head of the State Police in 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was an example of a governor exerting his influence on the city directly. He has done so increasingly in recent months, from forcing a state monitor on public housing to an order to close one jail facility at the troubled complex on Rikers Island.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the Cuomo administration said that its involvement in municipal matters is a function of state law, along with responding to tenant requests, federal investigations and security needs.\n\nMr. Cuomo has also cited the \u201cincompetent\u201d management of Nycha, which his office notes is controlled by the mayor, and he has mocked the mayor\u2019s timeline to close Rikers.\n\nEven on areas of agreement, there is no comity. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides reached out to aides for Mr. de Blasio to suggest a joint push around bail reform \u2014 an important progressive issue in this year\u2019s budget negotiations. City Hall officials suspected ulterior motives. In the end, it did not happen.\n\nA majority of New Yorkers, among them Corey Johnson, the new City Council speaker, say the conflict is hurting the city.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful for the city,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cAt the same time, you deal with the cards that you\u2019re dealt.\u201d\n\nNearly everyone has been pressured to pick sides \u2014 few more so than Mr. Johnson, who has had three face-to-face meetings with the governor in three months, and weekly sit-downs with the mayor that included a recent one that stretched to two and a half hours.\n\n\u201cI would just say that it\u2019s a little overwhelming,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be drawn into this.\u201d", "title": "Inside One of America\u2019s Ugliest Political Feuds: Cuomo vs. de Blasio", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "J.

Bach ended the I.O.C.\u2019s ban on Russia\u2019s athletes after three months, almost immediately after the Pyeongchang Games, where a neutral team consisting of Russian athletes was the third-largest contingent. Track and field\u2019s ban, which may soon become even more severe, has been in effect since 2015. Both men have large egos and lengthy athletic r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Their relationship, once close, has cooled over the Russia issue; they have barely spoken in recent weeks.\n\nOfficials on every side of the disagreement declined to speak publicly about it, citing the sensitive nature of negotiations over the matter.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe stalemate shows few signs of ending. The I.A.A.F. will not lift its ban until the World Anti-Doping Agency declares Russia in compliance with all of its regulations. WADA will not do that unless Russia acknowledges the dimensions of the scandal and allows access to a database at the Moscow laboratory that was at the heart of much of the wrongdoing.\n\nRussia has shown few signs of ceding to either demand. In meetings, Russian officials continue to deny the existence of the institutionalized doping plot now outlined in three independent reports, according to people involved in the talks. By denying access to the data stored at the laboratory, the Russians are preventing officials from verifying information that may provide conclusive evidence.\n\nA person with knowledge of the discussions said an admission of guilt was essential for convincing WADA that Russia would not violate doping rules in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about humiliating them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scale of Russia\u2019s doping scheme was revealed after Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of its antidoping laboratory, became a whistle-blower. Rodchenkov, now living in the United States, described an audacious plan that involved state security services and the large-scale swapping of drug-tainted urine samples for clean ones.\n\nTop track officials seethed when the International Olympic Committee lifted its ban on Russia\u2019s Olympic committee, saying it weakened the leverage that the international sports federations had over Russia in negotiations. Russia will play host to soccer\u2019s World Cup this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCraig Reedie, WADA\u2019s president, told 900 delegates at its symposium last month in Lausanne, Switzerland, that Russia had ignored four letters proposing a joint inspection of the laboratory in Moscow where hundreds of samples are stored.\n\n\u201cThe big losers here are Russian athletes,\u201d Reedie said. \u201cTheir participation in future events will continue to be put in doubt, and the rest of the world will not be convinced any meaningful change has taken place. Real action is needed. It\u2019s time for this situation to change. If not, it will damage sport \u2014 every Russian victory will be doubted.\u201d\n\nRussia has met most of the other requirements for readmission that WADA demanded three years ago. Russia\u2019s antidoping agency has new leadership. It is once again testing athletes.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the day before the symposium, Dmitry Shlyakhtin, the head of Russia\u2019s athletics federation, and Pavel Kolobkov, its sports minister, met with officials from an I.A.A.F task force for monitoring Russian compliance. The group, led by the Norwegian antidoping expert Rune Andersen, made clear that a threat in March to ban Russia from the sport permanently was real.\n\n\u201cThis severe step is possible if we will not be constantly proving that our athletes and coaches are observing antidoping regulations and rules of tournaments,\u201d Shlyakhtin recently told Tass, Russia\u2019s state-controlled news agency.\n\nThe stakes are high for all sides. Russia remains one of track and field\u2019s powerhouse nations; only the United States and Kenya have won more world championship medals. Russia has also played a vital role in sponsoring and hosting track and field events, from junior competitions to the 2013 world championships.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It would also require Russia to reapply for membership, which isn\u2019t guaranteed and raises doubts about its team\u2019s participation in the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which are just two years away.\n\nSuch a result would be hugely embarrassing for Bach and the Olympic committee. Coe was one of the first people Bach turned to when he looked to reform the I.O.C. after his elevation to president in 2013. But Coe, who has led track\u2019s governing body since 2015, has still not been invited to join the Olympic committee even though he heads probably the most important sport in the Summer Olympics program.\n\nIn March, Coe announced the possibility of doubling down on penalties against Russia as he was facing his own crisis. The previous day, a British parliamentary committee accused Coe of misleading the lawmakers\u2019 investigation into a scheme by the I.A.A.F.\u2019s previous leadership to extort Russian athletes who had failed drug tests. People close to Coe, who was vice president of the federation during the extortion scheme, said Coe\u2019s threat of a permanent ban on Russia was not related to the parliamentary report that criticized him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBach has long emphasized a preference for individual justice over collective punishment. He pushed the I.O.C. to clear 169 Russian athletes to participate at the Pyeongchang Games, where they were allowed to wear uniforms bearing the word \u201cRussia.\u201d By contrast, the I.A.A.F allowed only 19 to compete at the 2017 World Championships. They were not identified as Russians.\n\nRecent developments appear to vindicate the I.A.A.F.\u2019s cautious approach to restoring Russian membership. The Austrian police, acting on a tip from WADA, raided the headquarters of biathlon\u2019s global governing body last week, linking its leaders with possible efforts to cover up Russian doping.\n\nBefore the I.A.A.F. meets to decide Russia\u2019s fate, officials will be paying close attention to developments at a crucial WADA board meeting next month in Montreal. Russia will once again be the dominant agenda item, with a monitoring group expected to recommend retaining the suspension on Russia\u2019s antidoping agency.", "title": "Inside the Deadlock Over Russia\u2019s Track and Field Athletes", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"]}

But Sheiman also said Relevent took pains not to appear to big-foot the American players, leagues and owners who have exerted considerable effort \u2014 and invested considerable sums \u2014 in backing professional women\u2019s soccer.\n\nSo while they said they could have filled a four-team field with European squads quickly, Sheiman said it would have been \u201cirresponsible\u201d not to have a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team involved.\n\nBefore the inaugural weekend tournament in July, the women\u2019s teams from Europe will gather in Portland, Ore., for several days of training.

Juventus started a women\u2019s professional team last year, and in March, Manchester United announced plans to create its first one.\n\nMany of those clubs are longtime I.C.C. partners.\n\n\u201cWe think we can give it the stage it deserves,\u201d Sheiman said of an intercontinental club competition for women. \u201dAnd then, coming back in 2019, spend some time and think about: What\u2019s the best format we have?

That would be the fastest pace since 2012.\n\nLarge tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers.

Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper.\n\nRepublicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares.\n\nBoeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year.\n\nAs they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation\u2019s banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks.\n\nBank Buybacks Surge Banks in the United States have increasingly bought back shares of their own stock, a trend that accelerated in 2017 as the banks anticipated a windfall from President Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Amount spent each year on share buybacks by publicly traded banks. billion $60 40 20 0 $77.5 billion 2010 2012 2014 2016\n\nRepublicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\u201d\n\nA recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies.\n\nA survey by the National Association of Manufacturers in April found record-high expectations among members for capital investments this year. Historically, that survey is a strong predictor of future investments, though over the past two years actual investment has underperformed what the survey predicted. A survey by the National Association for Business Economics also finds capital spending expectations rising from a year ago \u2014 but two-thirds of respondents said the new tax law did not cause them to change hiring or investment plans. Morgan Stanley said Monday that its Capex Plans Index for future capital expenditures fell slightly in April, from what had been a record high.\n\nVerizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017.

Comcast\u2019s $31 billion offer for the British satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox, with backing from the Walt Disney Company\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet.\n\nComcast, the cable giant run by Brian L. Roberts, firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share on Wednesday, beating Mr. Murdoch\u2019s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul\u2019s plan to sell Fox \u2014 including Sky \u2014 to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch could persuade Mr. Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like the streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it\u2019s a straightforward battle on price.\n\nComcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday, the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pretax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky\u2019s TV shows and movies with Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky\u2019s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That\u2019s just about in line with cable groups\u2019 cost of capital, according to New York University estimates.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky\u2019s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: Its debt is low for a cable group, and its Ebitda \u2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 this year will be greater than Disney\u2019s and Fox\u2019s combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast\u2019s dual-class stock means Mr. Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans.\n\nMr. Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Mr. Murdoch will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building and might want to hang on to Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to \u00a313.57 on Wednesday are wagering that Disney and Fox will disregard financial sense.", "title": "Investors Bet That Fox and Disney Will Toss Financial Sense Aside", "authors": ["Liam Proud"]}

With Telegram, Iranians keep in touch with family and friends, read the news, shop, discuss soccer, babies, marriage and politics. It\u2019s the best of Twitter and the most viral videos on YouTube. People use it to download music and films, and, of course, to flirt. They also use it to read speeches from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who blasts out content over his official channel.\n\nPart of the reason Telegram is so popular is it\u2019s easy to use. Another reason is more political: Since the pro-reform protests in 2009, the hard-liners in Iran\u2019s government, working through their allies in the judiciary and security services, have effectively blocked nearly all foreign-based blogging and publishing platforms, social media and messaging apps.\n\nNow they want to do the same with Telegram.

Several years ago, the Postal Service added Sunday delivery for Amazon packages.\n\nThe agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion on $69.6 billion in revenue during its last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and faces huge retirement benefit obligations. Without Amazon\u2019s business, the financial picture at the Postal Service would most likely be bleaker, many analysts say.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to demand better financial performance from the U.S.P.S., but something very different, in our view, to equate the U.S.P.S. financial struggles with the rise of Amazon,\u201d Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, a stock research firm, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. \u201cIf nothing else, the U.S.P.S. was already generating billions of dollars in operating losses well before Amazon became a large customer.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, Amazon very much depends on the Postal Service to take their packages the last mile to their destination. By one estimate, about 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s orders are delivered by the agency, with the rest handled by U.P.S., FedEx and a hodgepodge of other carriers.\n\nCompanies that do a lot of shipping, like Amazon, often negotiate deals with the Postal Service to pay less than an ordinary person would to send goods. It is essentially a discount for buying in bulk.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is where the president seems to be focused, and partly why Amazon\u2019s stock has fallen sharply in the last week. Its shares are down more than 20 points \u2014 nearly 1.5 percent \u2014 since March 28.\n\nBut the Postal Service says all such deals it makes are profitable \u2014 and must be by law.\n\nAn independent body, the Postal Regulatory Commission, oversees the rates that the Postal Service charges for its products. By law, the agreements it cuts with corporate customers like Amazon must cover their \u201cattributable costs\u201d that directly result from their use of the postal network.\n\nAmazon helps lower those costs by organizing the packages it takes to the Post Office by destination ZIP code in over 35 sorting centers around the country, leaving less work that must be done by postal workers. The company relies on the Postal Service strictly for last-mile delivery to customers, short trips that further limit the cost of delivering each package.\n\nBut in one of his tweet attacks, Mr. Trump seemed to dispute whether Amazon was covering the Postal Service\u2019s costs, saying that \u201cit is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s figure appears to have come from an opinion piece published last year in The Wall Street Journal and written by an investor whose firm held shares in FedEx. The piece argued that the Postal Service was undercharging for the agency\u2019s fixed costs, like its post offices and trucks, when calculating its package contracts. The investor said that the minimum amount that the agency allocates to package delivery and similar products \u2014 5.5 percent of the agency\u2019s total fixed costs \u2014 is far too low.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Joseph Corbett, the chief financial officer of the Postal Service, said previously that it provided an \u201cinaccurate and unfair account\u201d of its package business.\n\n\n\nWhile the Postal Service is subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, there is an exemption in the federal law that allows it to avoid releasing particulars of its deals with private businesses like Amazon, said Kevin Kosar, vice president of policy at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit conservative-leaning think tank, who has studied the Postal Service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmazon\u2019s silence about the details of its contract haven\u2019t helped clarify matters.

According to a report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, one in 10 Australians have used cannabis in the last 12 months.\n\nIn some states, like the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and the Northern Territory, possession of small amounts of marijuana has been effectively decriminalized, with offenders facing civil penalties like fines and being ordered to undergo counseling.\n\nIn other states, like New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, police officers often issue warnings to those facing minor drug charges, with offenders diverted to education programs.\n\nCultivating, selling or transporting marijuana, however, can incur criminal charges anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cIf somebody is found with small amounts of cannabis for personal use, the primary response for me isn\u2019t a law enforcement response, it\u2019s a public response,\u201d says Professor Steve Allsop of the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University. \u201cPutting people into the criminal justice system creates harm.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Australia legalized marijuana for medicinal use.

Argentina, Cambodia, Canada, Spain, the Netherlands, Colombia, Peru and (somewhat surprisingly) North Korea are just some of the countries that don\u2019t criminalize marijuana use.\n\nOne notable example is Portugal, where the use of all illicit drugs was decriminalized in 2001 and drug users are mainly sent to treatment programs or fined. Since then, the country\u2019s prevalence of HIV infection, drug-related imprisonment and overdoses have dropped.\n\nJamaica, a country long associated with marijuana and Rastafarianism, also recently relaxed its laws around marijuana possession in 2015.\n\nSo will Australia\u2019s marijuana laws change?\n\nFor now, Australia\u2019s government says no.\n\nAnd being careful and conservative in legalizing marijuana might not be such a bad thing, Professor Allsop said.\n\n\u201cIf you legalize a form of drug use \u2014 once you\u2019ve done that it\u2019s very hard to go backwards,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be carefully evaluated steps to change rather than a great leap into the unknown.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the issue will go away, particularly since legalization has the support of a major political party like the Greens.

What\u2019s funny about that one to me is that \u201celevator\u201d is an Americanism that some Brits feared was taking over in the 1960s. But no, \u201clift\u201d is still around, and it\u2019s trying to make American hotels and shopping centers sound cool or cosmopolitan now.\n\nIs Anglocreep largely a New York thing?\n\nNew York definitely has it bad, but there\u2019s a fair amount of it in Washington and Boston too. One of the \u201clift\u201d elevators was in North Carolina.

As you go more westward, there\u2019s more distance from Britain and fewer cultural ties to it, except in Utah, where the odd Britishism crops up because of British Mormons migrating there in the late 19th century.

Of course, in the 1930s, they were complaining about the Americanism \u201cto contact,\u201d and now no one notices it\u2019s an import.\n\nSo nothing\u2019s changed since \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d I take it.

One of the drivers of the increase was spending on protecting the Facebook community, he said. But there were other factors, he added, like spending on what he called innovation.\n\n\u2022 What is more, the sales and marketing expense was equivalent to 13 percent of revenue in the first quarter, the same share as a year ago. An increase in that percentage would bolster Facebook\u2019s claims that it is pulling out the stops to prevent misuse.\n\n\u2022 Cost of revenue expense, the second largest cost line, surged 66 percent in the first quarter, and it rose proportionately as well. In the first quarter, it was 16 percent of revenue, compared to 14 percent for the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u2022 Facebook\u2019s largest expense line, research and development, did not show an abnormal increase. It had a 22 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, slower than the 25 percent annual jump in the fourth quarter of 2017. It accounted for 19 percent of revenue in the first quarter, down from 23 percent in the same period a year ago.\n\nIf Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can.

It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)\n\nTwitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more.

In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.\n\nMr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength.

By law, the consumer bureau has to collect those complaints. But it is not legally required to share them online.\n\nWhy finance institutions want it shut down\n\nThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy consumer groups say that could be problematic\n\nConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.\n\nThe bureau has used the complaints to spot patterns of bad behavior. A wave of complaints about Wells Fargo helped spur the agency\u2019s investigation and exposure of the bank\u2019s sham accounts. Complaints have also prompted actions against student loan servicers, debt collectors, mortgage lenders and credit card companies.\n\nMore than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.\n\nTwitter\u2019s outlook spooks investors.\n\nThe social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.\n\nTwitter reported a profit of $61 million, its second-straight profitable quarter. Revenue rose 21 percent to $665 million during the first quarter. User numbers rose slightly to 336 million per month.\n\nShares opened up 5 percent before tumbling more than 7 percent. The reason? The company softened its outlook for the year.\n\nIf those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.\n\nWhy such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\n\n\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.\n\nPhoto\n\nBehind the fight over a key banking rule\n\nWall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeter Eavis outlines the arguments:\n\nWhy relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.\n\nWhy keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\n\nThe political flyaround\n\n\u2022 A federal judge ruled that the DACA program must continue and accept new applications, because the Trump administration didn\u2019t adequately justify ending it.

{"date": "2018-04-21 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Brown, 49, wasn\u2019t out at Facebook. Yet she has long had to grapple with questions about whether she really has influence at the social network.\n\nSince joining the Silicon Valley company in 2017 to repair its frayed relationship with the news media, many have considered the former CNN and NBC anchor as little more than window dressing. Others see her as a more insidious figure \u2014 a telegenic personality with close ties to conservative figures who can offer Facebook\u2019s outreach the veneer of journalistic credibility. To them, she is an ambassador from a dictatorship, willing to deliver bad news with a smile and some canap\u00e9s. No matter their view of her, almost all question what influence she has at a company where the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has viewed news \u2014 both making it and displaying it \u2014 as a headache.\n\nBut a year and a half into her tenure, Ms. Brown, who became a school-choice activist with close ties to conservative politics after her TV career, is emerging as a fiery negotiator for her vision of Facebook as a publishing platform, according to interviews with more than 30 people who work or who regularly interact with her. This month, Hollywood Reporter named Ms. Brown one of this year\u2019s 35 most powerful New York media figures.\n\nFacebook \u2014 with its reach of more than 2.2 billion users \u2014 already holds enormous power over the news that people consume. But now it is making its first venture into licensed news content. Facebook has set aside a $90 million budget to have partners develop original news programming, and Ms. Brown is pitching publishers on making Facebook-specific news shows featuring mainstream anchors, according to two people involved in or briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnce those shows get started, Ms. Brown wants to use Facebook\u2019s existing Watch product \u2014 a service introduced in 2017 as a premium product with more curation that has nonetheless been flooded with far-right conspiracy programming \u2014 to be a breaking news destination. The result would be something akin to an online competitor to cable news.\n\nMs. Brown is also pushing paywalls for publishers on the social network, another first for a company that has long avoided circulating any content that users would have to pay for.\n\n\u201cThis is us changing our relationship with publishers and emphasizing something that Facebook has never done before; it\u2019s having a point of view,\u201d Ms. Brown said in February at a tech and media conference where she discussed how Facebook planned to de-emphasize low-quality news and could even begin paying some publishers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether all these changes last \u2014 or even get implemented \u2014 are open questions. Facebook has started down the road of editorial control before, only to change course. The company laid off a group of editors in 2016 after a controversy over its Trending Topics items and replaced them with an algorithm that automatically surfaces the top news of the day.\n\nAnd with recent changes that have lowered the visibility of hard news in Facebook\u2019s News Feed, frustration within the media industry is mounting. Rupert Murdoch, News Corp.\u2019s executive chairman, has called for publishers to band together to force Facebook to pay for news content.\n\nMs. Brown declined to speak on the record but some Facebook colleagues spoke about how she has navigated the relationships with the news media and inside the company, even as the social network\u2019s own rapport with journalism remains uneasy.\n\n\u201cCampbell leads a critical piece of our business,\u201d said Dan Rose, Facebook\u2019s vice president for partnerships. \u201cShe\u2019s been incredibly effective, and she\u2019s just getting started.\u201d\n\nPlunging Into News\n\nMs. Brown was born into a tight-knit Catholic family in 1968 in Ferriday, La., population about 5,000. Her father, a local politician and state insurance commissioner, once served a prison stint for lying to the F.B.I. during an investigation related to an insurance company.\n\nIn her youth, Ms. Brown was kicked out of an all-girls boarding school for sneaking off campus to a party. She spent two years at Louisiana State University before attending Regis University, a small Jesuit school in Denver. Afterward, she moved to then-Czechoslovakia for two years to teach English before returning to the United States and beginning a television news career, going from a local station in Topeka, Kan., to Richmond, Va., then Baltimore.\n\nPhoto\n\nHer approach on camera was confrontational, yet likable. In 1996, she got a call from NBC News.\n\n\u201cThere was something about her on screen that indicated she was a person who could make you feel comfortable \u2014 the nice girl next door you could talk to,\u201d Neal Shapiro, then president of NBC, said in 2003.\n\nAt NBC, she became a political campaign reporter, covering George W. Bush\u2019s run for the presidency in 2000. She smoked cigarettes and threw parties. With her best friend and fellow reporter Anne Kornblut, she started \u201cChick Chat,\u201d a social group for female White House correspondents that drew political guests as well as charges of elitism from those it excluded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile in Iraq in 2004 for a story on the Abu Ghraib prison complex, she met Dan Senor, chief spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. Ms. Brown asked him out and they married in 2006 and now have two sons, ages 8 and 10. Ms. Brown converted to Judaism, her husband\u2019s religion, before their marriage, and friends said the couple is known for hosting raucous seders with skits and singing.\n\nMr. Senor now works for the conservative billionaire Paul Elliott Singer\u2019s hedge fund, Elliott Management, and is a power broker in the Republican fund-raising world, as well as a frequent guest on morning news shows.\n\nIn 2007, Ms. Brown joined CNN as a prime-time anchor but struggled for good ratings. She quit three years later with a statement that threw shade at her fellow CNN anchors, saying that she could not compromise her desire for honest, unbiased reporting.\n\n\n\n\u201cShedding my own journalistic skin to try to inhabit the kind of persona that might coexist in that line up is simply impossible for me,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSome said her behavior now, seemingly throwing Facebook\u2019s strategy of silence under the bus, mirrors that letter.\n\nA \u2018Friend of Sheryl\u2019\n\nBut after leaving CNN, Ms. Brown did shed her journalistic skin, and turned herself into a political animal.\n\nMs. Brown became an activist focused on education. She fought teachers\u2019 unions, a tactic some friends think was meant to position her for a run for office. A New York Magazine profile once posed the question, \u201cHow did an ex-news anchor become the most controversial woman in school reform?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe was a celebrity in ed reform,\u201d said Eva Moskowitz, the founder and chief executive of the Success Academy Charter Schools, where Ms. Brown is a board member. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have people of her prominence before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Brown also started an education news site called The 74 Million, which often reports on issues around teachers\u2019 unions, and an advocacy group called The Partnership for Educational Justice, which funded a lawsuit against teacher tenure. She served on the board of Betsy DeVos\u2019s American Federation for Children. (Ms. Devos has funded The 74 Million.) When President Trump nominated Ms. DeVos to be Secretary of Education last year, Ms. Brown wrote an op-ed in her defense, calling Ms. DeVos a \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nBy then, Facebook was in crisis mode over how it handled news.\n\nIn mid-2016, the social network was grappling with criticism that its Trending Topics team of editors was choosing to feature left-leaning content and leaving out right-leaning posts. A few months later, the term \u201cfake news\u201d would crash into the lexicon after the presidential election.\n\nMs. Kornblut, who had left the Washington Post to go work at Facebook with Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, called Ms. Brown in to help rebuild news relationships and ease tensions with an agitated media world. Ms. Brown\u2019s hiring was announced in January 2017.\n\nMany in the news business were immediately skeptical about what Ms. Brown might do.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to deeply understand American journalists, having a TV personality is not really the first place you would go,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a nonprofit that supports news media with research and training.\n\nAt Facebook, Ms. Brown became part of an informal cadre on the company\u2019s business side known as the FOSSes, or \u201cFriends of Sheryl Sandberg.\u201d But close association with a powerful figure within the company does not assure her of success.\n\nWhen it comes to decisions related to publishers, the power at Facebook has traditionally been more with the product staff, who tend to be aligned more with Mr. Zuckerberg and cloistered from meetings with partners, according to several media executives. Google, in contrast, has a similar power dynamic but, publishers said, a more robust partnership structure and easier contact with product teams.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s smart, but we\u2019re different beasts,\u201d Richard Gingras, the vice president for news at Google, said of Ms. Brown. \u201cI\u2019m in a fortunate position where I\u2019m involved with the product. I can make change. I feel for her, I really do.\u201d\n\nWhile Ms. Brown has helped Facebook mount its charm offensives at industry events, her efforts to remake Facebook\u2019s relationships with publishers has meant cutting back her visibility to the broader public.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere was a time you couldn\u2019t turn on a T.V. and not see Campbell Brown,\u201d said Ben Winkler, chief investment officer for OMD, a global media agency. \u201cSince she went to Facebook, Campbell Brown is where?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNegotiating Partnerships\n\nThe answer, it turns out, was close to home. Editors talk about Facebook as an authoritarian regime or perhaps an ideological cult, and they call Ms. Brown its emissary to the city.\n\nShe takes those ambassadorial duties seriously. She\u2019s a regular figure in the New York media scrum, such as a recent Pulitzer reception at the media hot spot Michael\u2019s. She also hosts frequent media and Facebook mixers at her modern, airy TriBeCa apartment.\n\nAt these events, attendees are met with wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres (seared tuna, and a cheese and cracker buffet). Guests describe Ms. Brown as \u201ca hoot\u201d with a sharp humor. When she calls the party to order, the group sits around her living room on leather cowhide seats and polished wooden stumps.\n\nMs. Brown typically has a guest of honor from Facebook, such as the chief product officer Chris Cox, and allows questions. If she deems a question too challenging for the guest, she pushes back against the inquisitor \u2014 her go-to is some form of the retort, \u201cReally?\u201d\n\nThe gatherings are frequently a who\u2019s who of the news media, mixing long-established outlets with digitally focused newcomers. The guest lists have included Ben Smith, the BuzzFeed editor in chief; David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker; Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired; and the Vox publisher Melissa Bell. One editor, who asked not to be identified because these gatherings are off the record, said he felt \u201chumiliated\u201d afterward, having been reminded that the power of traditional publishers is waning.\n\nThe gatherings are the first outreach Facebook has made to the New York media world \u2014 a world that is increasingly beholden to the company\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of publishers there, they have to manage good relationships in order to survive, let alone thrive,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade association serving digital content companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome said Ms. Brown has had more influence on Facebook than they expected, citing the introduction of paywalls and the prospect of the company paying for content.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

At one recent meeting, two publishers complained about having lost a lot of online traffic after changes to Facebook\u2019s News Feed. According to one publisher who was present, Ms. Brown told them the company would give them more traffic if they stopped doing clickbait.\n\nStill, the media industry has been so beaten down by Facebook that some said they were happy to just have someone in the company who talks to them.\n\n\u201cWe see some small movement in the right direction in terms of at least improving transparency,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, chief executive of Vox Media. There had not been \u201creal movement in terms of providing better business opportunity,\u201d he added. \u201cBut at least we\u2019re being listened to.\u201d\n\nMs. Brown recently helped arrange a meeting between Mr. Zuckerberg and several members of The Washington Post management team: Martin Baron, the editor; Fred Ryan, the chief executive; and Shailesh Prakash, the chief product officer. The group discussed whether a Facebook user should hit a paywall on Post content after clicking on three, five or 10 articles. Mr. Zuckerberg said 10, but The Post executives wanted a paywall to start after 3 articles, according to a person who was in the meeting.\n\nMs. Brown went for the middle ground, pushing Mr. Zuckerberg to give The Post a test run of paywalls that kick in after three and five Post articles are read. She won. Since March 1, The Post has been doing just that, according to Mr. Prakash.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s helped us,\u201d Mr. Prakash said.\n\nBut Ms. Brown\u2019s biggest project is developing a news apparatus within Facebook\u2019s premium video section, called Watch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe is negotiating with BuzzFeed, Vox, CNN, Fox News and others to partner on creating about a half-dozen Facebook-exclusive shows, which will launch in May and June.\n\nBuilding off these shows, Ms. Brown is pushing to create a curated breaking news destination and envisions a cohesive daily Facebook newscast using partner content highlights \u2014 paid for by Facebook, made by media partners, and edited by a growing editorial team, according to a person familiar with her thinking.\n\nDiscussing Facebook\u2019s reticence to put paywalls in and engage with publishers transparently, Ms. Brown said at the February media and tech conference that it had taken too long for the social network to come around to a workable news strategy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time with patience right now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know publishers are too.\u201d", "title": "Is Facebook\u2019s Campbell Brown a Force to Be Reckoned With?

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "The speaker of the House\u2019s institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party\u2019s policy goals. Success in one dimension \u2014 as Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s decision to retire reflects \u2014 does not always translate into success in the other.\n\nIn the context of protecting Republican control, there\u2019s little reason to think that Mr. Ryan would be a liability to Republicans\u2019 prospects of holding a majority. A February Politico/Morning Consult poll put Mr. Ryan\u2019s national favorability at an anemic 36 percent, but he has not been used \u2014 at least to this point \u2014 as a high-profile symbolic figure in Democrats\u2019 campaigns to retake the House of Representatives. A recent analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of roughly 300,000 House and Senate campaign ads aired since January 2017 indicates that unfavorable mentions of Mr. Ryan (0.3 percent of airings) were much less common than negative depictions of President Trump (6 percent) and the minority leader, Nancy Pelosi (2.4 percent).\n\nThe biggest factors affecting what happens in November, according to political science research, are not things like the speaker of the House but so-called fundamentals, like presidential approval, the state of the economy and the number of seats the majority party is defending. And the president\u2019s party is almost always likely to take a beating; in only three midterm elections since 1934 has the party controlling the White House gained seats. Mr. Ryan\u2019s retirement is not likely to break these trends.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume Mr. Ryan isn\u2019t an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, \u201cThe job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority.\u201d The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party.", "title": "Opinion | Is It Even Possible to Succeed as House G.O.P.

Or should be.\u201d\n\nTo make it in a man\u2019s world, the saying goes, women must do everything men do \u2014 but backward and in high heels. For N.F.L. cheerleaders, there\u2019s a further twist: They must stand on the sidelines, in high heels, cheering for the men for very little money in a world where players rake in millions and even the mascots make up to $65,000 a year.\n\nAs The Times and others have noted, the rules placed on cheerleaders today are reminiscent of a different era, with weigh-ins, mandatory manicures, advice on the proper use of tampons and suggestions for how to politely respond to fans who are prying or engaging in harassment. Were a person to sift through the 1960s-era rule books of Hugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy clubs \u2014 rules created for the female servers called \u201cbunnies\u201d \u2014 they would find striking similarities: the bunnies were issued \u201cdemerits\u201d for chewing gum, dirty fingernails or unkempt hair. But even they got a salary and benefits.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so hard about being an N.F.L. cheerleader is that not only do you have to be a technically trained dancer, but you have to look good while doing it,\u201d Ms. Davis said. \u201cYou have to wear three-inch heels while doing it. Your makeup has to be full on, you have to constantly be smiling, even when you\u2019re just standing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a double standard,\u201d said Kate Mayfield, 37, a former cheerleader for the Baltimore Ravens who is now a hedge fund consultant. \u201cThey explain it to us like the rules are in place to keep us out of trouble, because the league is going to protect the player if something happens. Because the players are, if it comes down to it, more important, even though we\u2019re also on the field. I don\u2019t think I questioned it back then. I was 22.\u201d\n\nA 2012 Raiders etiquette handbook reviewed by The Times advised cheerleaders to \u201csit in a ladylike manner \u2014 cross your ankles or cross your legs but keep your legs together.\u201d A rule book for the Bengals, submitted as part of a lawsuit in 2014, noted \u201cyou are given a 3 lb leniency weight,\u201d \u201cno gum chewing,\u201d \u201cno slouching breasts.\u201d Both teams said this week that the rule books had been revised but would not provide specifics.\n\n\u201cFor me, and many of my teammates, the real killer was body dysmorphia and eating disorders, and the depression and anxiety which stem from that,\u201d said Lyndsey Raucher, a college student who cheered for the New England Patriots from 2016 to 2017. \u201cI fear that I will never fully be the same.\u201d", "title": "Is It Time to Rethink the Rules for N.F.L.

Each time President Putin declares victory or announces a drawdown of Russian forces, like he did in December, the fighting flares up with a new intensity and Moscow is required to fly in reinforcements \u2026 Moscow is now struggling to parlay its military gains into an internationally legitimate political settlement that would help Russia recoup its investments in the conflict. For now, Syria remains ungovernable and splintered into fiefdoms run by regional players with their own interests.\n\nPutin\u2019s latest beef-for-sugar trade was his apparent ordering of the use of a military-grade nerve agent, produced only in Russia, to poison the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury. The Western response has been what British Prime Minister Theresa May described as the biggest collective expulsion of alleged Russian intelligence officers ever \u2014 over 100 from more than 20 countries.\n\nWhether timed or coincidental, the poisoning attack and the Western backlash helped Putin run up his vote totals in his latest phony presidential re-election \u2014 another sugar high. But the morning after, Putin\u2019s Russia is more isolated than ever. Also, Putin\u2019s cronies and other Russian oligarchs \u2014 whose game is to make tons of dirty money in Russia and then take it to London, where it can be laundered for safekeeping \u2014 are now getting more scrutinized than ever by British authorities.\n\nAnd then there is Putin\u2019s long-range strategy \u2014 to bet against Mother Nature, human nature and Moore\u2019s Law, all at once. He\u2019s betting against Mother Nature \u2014 that the world will indefinitely remain addicted to his oil and gas in an age of disruptive climate change. He\u2019s betting against human nature \u2014 that his young people won\u2019t want to be free to realize their full potential, not just live off sugar-high memories of historical greatness. And he\u2019s betting against Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 that the steady growth of technology won\u2019t empower Russia\u2019s youth to connect and collaborate, and see through his charade.\n\nPutin\u2019s troubles are nothing I celebrate. I was against NATO expansion; I wanted Russia integrated into the family of European democracies. A weak, isolated and humiliated Russia is a dangerous animal. But to thrive in the long term, Russia needs a \u201creset,\u201d and it can come only from within, but Putin won\u2019t press the button.\n\n\u201cWithout reform, there is little reason to be optimistic about Russia\u2019s long-run growth trend, given its poor demographic profile, weak institutions and abject failure to diversify its economy, despite having an enormously talented and creative population,\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard University economist, wrote in The Guardian last year. \u201cIf the world continues to move toward a low-carbon future, Russia will confront an inevitable choice: launch economic and political reforms or face continuing marginalization, with or without Western sanctions.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see a country that gave us Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, Spassky, Sakharov, Stravinsky, Shishkin, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Pushkin, Nureyev and the Google co-founder Sergey Brin become better known for giving the world Novichok, the deadly Russian nerve agent used in Britain; \u201clittle green men,\u201d the disguised Russian soldiers who seized Eastern Ukraine; and Guccifer 2.0, the Russian cyberagent who hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s all beef for sugar \u2014 and that\u2019s Putin\u2019s legacy.", "title": "Opinion | Is Putin a C.I.A.

By insisting on the strategy of appealing to white Republican and moderate voters, Democrats have lost over and over again with a population that is nearly a majority of people of color \u2014 specifically, voters of color who make up nearly half of the Democratic Party membership in Georgia and nationally. Even casual observations of these numbers and trends would indicate that Democrats do not need to persuade a single Trump voter to win.\n\nStacey Abrams had the vision to see the value of voters that are more often than not ignored by both parties. They are young people, black people and other voters of color \u2014 all of whom are part of the 1.2 million eligible and unregistered voters in Georgia. Some 700,000 of those voters live outside the metropolitan Atlanta area. Ms. Abrams had the foresight to see those voters as an untapped electoral resource. In 2014, while serving in the leadership of the Georgia House, she founded the nonprofit New Georgia Project to register and talk to them. If we reach those voters, listen to them and register them, she argued, they will become deeply engaged in our democratic process. In other words, they will vote.\n\nFurthermore, with the emerging voters engaged, Democrats could establish and enact an agenda beyond Atlanta. Ms. Abrams has addressed issues of racial justice, economic inequality, L.G.B.T. rights and gender discrimination in an integrated platform. Her vision for \u201ceconomic mobility\u201d directly takes on the structural barriers keeping people in poverty.\n\nAlso as part of her platform, she has advocated equal pay for women. For example, she\u2019s proposing to provide state dollars to entrepreneurs to start local businesses, with a focus on rural and low-income communities. She advocates providing health care to the working poor by expanding Medicaid coverage as well as securing the Affordable Care Act in the state to benefit an additional half million people and create tens of thousands of jobs. It would also provide a stronger economic base in rural counties. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that she is boldly advocating access to obstetricians and gynecologists, is an abortion rights advocate and wants to attract medical personnel to underserved areas of the state.\n\nThe Abrams campaign has also forged a connection with these voters on the ground: She has not poured millions into trivial television and radio ads but has instead stressed face-to-face meetings. Dozens of Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign staffers and volunteers have been on the ground for months knocking on doors, organizing community meetings and connecting with the voters. A recent poll shows the innovation is working: Ms. Abrams is leading Ms. Evans by 20 points.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used social media and online organizing as a central way to motivate and direct volunteers and build momentum, it was an innovation that changed electoral campaigning for good. Ms. Abrams\u2019s innovation is no less impactful. The Abrams idea \u2014 that black women leading a multiracial bloc of voters will establish a new base \u2014 may also revolutionize American electoral politics.", "title": "Opinion | Is Stacey Abrams Assembling a New Democratic Majority?", "authors": []}

As Kassem and others note, the seeds of \u201cISIS 2.0\u201d are already planted in the thousands of angry people who have lost their families, their homes, their country. \u201cWhen there are a million people dead,\u201d Kassem said, \u201cwhen most have lost everything, ISIS will say, \u2018We told you so.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has said that with America gone, its regional allies, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia, should pick up the slack. But that could make things even worse. Israel has a long and complicated relationship with Syria, and it has shown little willingness to get more involved. And Mr. Trump is perhaps forgetting that Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of the hard-core Wahhabi branch of Islam, which has inspired jihadists around the globe and could turbocharge a revived Islamic State.\n\nAs long as America has had troops in Syria, there was at least hope for a peaceful resolution to the war. Now the bottom is falling out. Kassem says he hears talk about the coming of the Mahdi, whom many Muslims believe will bring about Judgment Day, because the region is engulfed in chaos \u2014 a precondition for his arrival. \u201cEveryone is talking end of days,\u201d he says.", "title": "Opinion | Is Trump Sowing the Seeds for ISIS 2.0?", "authors": []}

Lizzy Martinez, 17, a junior at Braden River High School in Bradenton, Fla., had been swimming and tanning all weekend at a water park in Orlando. But when Monday morning came and she had to get dressed for school, Lizzy\u2019s bra felt painfully constricting on her burned skin. So she ditched the bra and purposely chose to wear something dark and loose \u2014 a long sleeve, oversize, crew neck gray T-shirt \u2014 so she wouldn\u2019t draw attention to her chest. But around 10 a.m., about 15 minutes into her veterinary assistance class, Lizzy was called out of the classroom for a meeting with two school officials, Dean Violeta Velazquez and Principal Sharon Scarbrough. They asked her why she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. She said she told her school administrators about the sunburn. They insisted that she was violating the school dress code. (The 2017-2018 Code of Student Conduct does not say bras must be worn by female students.) They told her to put on an undershirt because boys were \u201clooking and laughing\u201d at her, a detail she later challenged. \u201cNo one said a thing to me until I got to the dean\u2019s office,\u201d Lizzy said.

But an isolated managerial bubble allowed Dr. Jackson to serve three presidents for a decade while escaping scrutiny of alleged abuses of power and position. Dr. Jackson\u2019s employees were not subordinates of the White House chief of staff or the president\u2019s lawyer. Instead, the medical unit reported through a military chain of command to the little-known White House Military Office.\n\nWhen work conditions grew intolerable in the unit, it was the Navy\u2019s inspector general that stepped in, rendering a judgment in 2012 that the environment was \u201ctoxic\u201d and that one or both of the top two doctors, including Dr. Jackson, should go. But little appears to have changed.\n\nIn interviews with more than 24 people \u2014 including some of Dr. Jackson\u2019s former subordinates and a dozen White House political aides in the Trump and Obama administrations \u2014 officials said members of the medical and political staffs hardly came into contact with one another outside of routine medical treatment. They operated under different rules of behavior and rarely socialized together, even on long trips to foreign countries.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Dr. Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, the second-largest bureaucracy in the federal government, brought the two worlds into collision, surfacing allegations against Dr. Jackson that may otherwise never have emerged.\n\nThe aftermath has raised difficult questions for officials in all three administrations, who either did not know about the accusations or looked the other way. Some said they were vaguely aware of complaints from Mr. Jackson\u2019s subordinates about his abrasive manner, which several described as frat-boy behavior; most said they largely dismissed it as griping from employees who belonged to a separate chain of command.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see any of the alleged behaviors,\u201d said David Axelrod, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser from 2009 to 2011. \u201cMy experience was consistently positive.\u201d\n\nA few said they had heard whispers of drinking, though all of the former White House officials said they never saw him drunk on the job.

The former aide said Dr. Jackson also doled out stronger substances, such as Xanax and the addictive opioid Percocet, readily offering them when he believed they might be helpful.\n\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re going through a tough time,\u201d he would say, according to the former aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a bottle of this?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump lamented on Thursday Dr. Jackson\u2019s decision to withdraw from consideration, calling him \u201can admiral, highly respected, a real leader\u201d during a telephone call to \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d The president added: \u201cThese are all false accusations. These are false.

He said it was unlikely to be true given the kind of security clearances that Dr. Jackson requires to do his job.\n\n\u201cTop Secret, it\u2019s called Yankee White,\u201d Dr. Darling said. \u201cThat means you\u2019ve got direct access to the president of the United States. We go up to his personal residence. We can go there unaccompanied without the Secret Service or anything.

Carmi Gillon, a former chief of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet internal security agency, called on Israelis to switch off their televisions while Mr. Netanyahu spoke.

The formal reason given for the honor was that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is the only graduate of an Israeli government leadership development course to have become president.\n\nStill, the choice baffled many Israelis, not least because Honduras abstained from the 1947 United Nations vote for the partition of Palestine, paving the way for Israel\u2019s creation.

They have been battling with the Israeli government for years to receive recognition for their village, which would allow it to finally be connected to the water and electrical grids, and to benefit from public infrastructure like paved roads. But the state dug in its heels in and refused, bulldozing the village over and over.\n\nFinally, desperate to end the uncertainty and pain of living and raising families so precariously, the village residents signed an agreement with the government to move to a nearby town. Umm al-Hiran will be demolished, and a new town called Hiran will be built in its place. According to the planned town\u2019s bylaws, it will be home to religious Jews only; these racist requirements are legal under current Israeli law.\n\nPalestinians living in the occupied territories feel the continuing Nakba constantly, at each checkpoint that makes travel unbearable and keeps them contained, at each funeral for an unarmed protester killed by Israeli snipers and each time a settlement is built on stolen land with the blessing of the Israeli government. And if the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu follows through on its desires to annex the West Bank without providing full equal rights to its Palestinian residents, it won\u2019t be a new Nakba. It will be the continuation of one that has never fully ended.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that my grandparents could have imagined 70 years ago that I would become a member of Knesset, representing Palestinian citizens of Israel, a minority voice in the parliament of the country we did not ask for but that came to us on the land we have always called home. I can\u2019t know what place my children and grandchildren will have in their society in the future. But I am sure that to be able to create the kind of future I want for them \u2014 one in which they can live with equality and in peace \u2014 Israelis will have to do more than recognize the Nakba. They will have to end it.", "title": "Opinion | Israel Celebrates Its Independence, We Mourn Our Loss", "authors": []}

For more than a decade, their 140-square-mile strip has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt, sharply restricting the flow of goods and people. Indeed, many Gazans have never left the enclave, a grim measure of their prolonged isolation.\n\nUnemployment is more than 40 percent for the general population and nearly 60 percent for Palestinian youths. Last month, the United Nations warned of an imminent humanitarian disaster if global donors did not contribute $539 million for fuel for critical water, sanitation and health facilities, most for Gaza and its two million people. The remainder of the money would go to Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nUnder such conditions, it is no wonder that pent-up frustrations would erupt in protests, as they did last Friday. Responding to the demonstrations, Israeli forces killed 17 Palestinians at the border fence that separates Israel from Gaza. More than 1,000 Palestinians were injured. It was the worst violence since the Gaza war of 2014.\n\nIsrael has a right to defend itself and maintain civil order, but it also has an obligation to respect peaceful protests and not use live ammunition on unarmed demonstrators.

The official attributed the delay in making the material public to the time it took to analyze the documents, the vast majority of which were in Persian.\n\nBut the Iranian program to design and build nuclear weapons was hardly a secret; its existence was the reason that the United States, under President George W. Bush and then President Barack Obama, moved to block it. Both presidents said publicly that Iran had a bomb project underway, and the United States mounted, with Israel, a vast covert program to undermine the Iranian effort with one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies concluded in 2007 that Iran suspended the active portion of the bomb effort after the beginning of the Iraq war, in 2003, and Mr. Netanyahu confirmed that in his presentation. But he said that other elements of what Iran had called \u201cProject Amad\u201d went ahead, directed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an Iranian scientist.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That presentation included sketches of a \u201cspherical device\u201d that could be detonated using high explosives, similar to plans Mr. Netanyahu showed on Monday.\n\nThe I.A.E.A. presentation included documents showing the arc of a missile that detonates a warhead at an altitude of about 600 meters, roughly that at which the Hiroshima bomb was detonated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Netanyahu went beyond that on Monday, and brandished what he described as Iranian plans to build up to five nuclear weapons.\n\nBut he cited no evidence that those plans were pursued.\n\nUnder the nuclear deal that Secretary of State John Kerry reached in the summer of 2015 in Vienna, Iran was required to ship about 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country \u2014 a task it accomplished the next year \u2014 and to dismantle all but a small portion of the nuclear centrifuges that enrich uranium.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s best case for a violation of the Iran deal came when he insisted that the Iranians had falsified their declarations to the I.A.E.A. in late 2015, by denying they had ever planned to build a weapon.\n\nStill, even that would come as little shock to those who negotiated the deal: In effect, the agreement was made possible by allowing Iran to lie about the past, while imposing verification on it for the future.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing new in Bibi\u2019s presentation,\u201d Rob Malley, a former senior official in Mr. Obama\u2019s National Security Council and a member of the negotiating team with Iran, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday, using Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s nickname. \u201cAll it does is vindicate need for the nuclear deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Mr. Malley continued, \u201cthe Israeli prime minister has an audience of one: Trump.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that American intelligence agencies had been going through the material, concluded that it was authentic and that \u201cat the very least the Iranians continued to lie to their own people\u201d about the existence of a nuclear weapons program.\n\nBut he conceded that the material dated to a project that had formally ended around 2003. Asked whether there was evidence that Iran was in violation of the 2015 accord, Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave that to the lawyers, and the president will ultimately have to make a determination about that, too.\u201d But he added that Iran\u2019s refusal to turn over the archive voluntarily to international inspectors showed that the country could not be trusted with nuclear materials after the 2015 accord expires.\n\nA former senior Israeli intelligence official said the documents were significant because they revealed that Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u201cwas a far larger project\u201d than anyone knew, and proved that the Iranians were \u201con a clear path to the bomb.\u201d The official said that while none of the documents were currently operational, they provided a sort of lending library for future generations of Iranians who might want to build a nuclear weapon when restrictions in the agreement expire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Netanyahu had a spring in his step as he strode back and forth in front of a large projection screen and yanked back a black cloth to reveal shelves and cases stacked with copies of what he said was the evidence his spies had retrieved. He described the cache, which he said amounted to a half ton of documents, as \u201cone of the biggest intelligence achievements ever by the state of Israel.\u201d\n\nHe is awaiting what is likely to be an indictment on corruption charges. He is damaged politically, and has counted for his political survival on being seen as the only leader who can be trusted to keep Israelis safe. He has been agitating single-mindedly against the nuclear deal, even at the risk of fraying Israel\u2019s close ties with the United States during the Obama administration.\n\nIranian diplomats greeted Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s accusation with derision.\n\n\u201cHa, ha, ha,\u201d said Mohammad Marandi, a University of Tehran professor who is close to Iran\u2019s leaders and participated in the nuclear talks in Vienna. He said that Israel had \u201cfabricated evidence\u201d before and might have again. He called the timing of the Israeli disclosure suspect, and raised the idea that it might have been orchestrated in cooperation with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very convenient to bring this up two weeks before the decision on the nuclear deal is made,\u201d Mr. Marandi said. \u201cNo one in their right mind will take this seriously, unless there is a prearranged deal with the White House.\u201d\n\nThe senior Israeli official also said that Israel\u2019s government believed that Mr. Trump had already decided to abandon the nuclear agreement. Israel was thus not hoping to \u201cpressure\u201d Mr. Trump by publicizing evidence of Iran\u2019s lies but rather to \u201csupport\u201d him, the official said.\n\nThe official also said that Mr. Netanyahu had intended to publicize the Iranian nuclear files a day later, but moved it up partly in response to missile strikes in Syria late Sunday night, for which suspicion has fallen on Israel. The Israeli government calculated that Iran would feel less confident in retaliating militarily, possibly setting off a full-fledged regional war, if it were on the defensive in the international arena.", "title": "Israel Says Secret Files Detail Iran\u2019s Nuclear Subterfuge", "authors": ["David M.

There has been no apparent reason for Israel to use live ammunition.\n\nThe government claims that the protests are a cover for a more violent Hamas agenda, including encouraging Gazans to penetrate the fence and push into Israel. Israel has a right to defend its border, but in the face of unarmed civilians it could do so with nonlethal tactics common to law enforcement, such as the use of high-powered fire hoses.\n\nSince the protests began, Israeli forces have killed at least 29 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,000. On the day Mr. Murtaja died, eight other Palestinians were killed and five other journalists were among a thousand injured. There have been no known Israeli casualties.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Murtaja and the wounded journalists wore protective vests with signs proclaiming \u201cPRESS\u201d on the front has prompted suspicion that Israel deliberately targeted the journalists, as Reporters Without Borders, an activist group, and Rushdi Al Sarraj, Mr. Murtaja\u2019s friend and sometime collaborator, have alleged. In an interview with The New Yorker, Mr. Al Sarraj recalled how the Israeli Army had earlier boasted that its soldiers were so precise and competent they \u201cknow where they put every bullet and where every bullet landed.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military has said its forces did not intentionally shoot journalists. But that assertion was undercut by Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defense minister, who said on Tuesday that Mr. Murtaja was a Hamas captain who had used a drone to collect intelligence on Israeli forces. That volatile charge is at odds with independent news reporting and, if it is false, could put other journalists at grave risk. Mr. Lieberman provided no proof for the claim and further demonstrated his disdain for justice, rule of law and the role of a free press by arguing on Sunday that there are \u201cno innocent people\u201d in Hamas-run Gaza.", "title": "Opinion | Israel\u2019s Violent Response to Nonviolent Protests", "authors": []}

The agencies are relied upon to regularly evaluate the quality of institutions to ensure they comply with federal education law. The accreditors are responsible for flagging and penalizing schools that do not.\n\nMost public, private and nonprofit higher education institutions are regionally accredited, while national and specialized accreditors tend to draw for-profit and trade schools. To receive federal financial aid funding, schools must be accredited by an Education Department-recognized agency. The Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools was responsible for about 240 institutions that received $4.7 billion in taxpayer money when it came under scrutiny in 2015.\n\nFor-profit accreditation has faced scrutiny dating back to the early years of the G.I. Bill, when the institutions were accused of preying on veterans who received large sums of federal education funding when they returned from war.\n\nBut it had been decades since the for-profit sector felt as targeted as it did under the Obama administration, industry leaders say. And they contend that a reinstatement of the banished accrediting council could remedy the unfair treatment meted out by the previous White House. A federal judge recently ruled that the department had acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d in determining the council\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cAll we have ever asked for is due process and fairness,\u201d said Steve Gunderson, a former Republican congressman who leads the trade organization Career Education Colleges and Universities. \u201cWe now hope the current secretary will recognize the need to work with A.C.I.C.S. and the schools impacted by this ruling.\u201d\n\nThe independent advisory committee that vets accrediting bodies, called the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, will consider the council\u2019s application in May, just a few weeks before dozens of schools serving at least 100,000 students that are still operating under its purview will lose accreditation.\n\nThe chairman of the bipartisan committee is Arthur Keiser, a political appointee who challenged the panel\u2019s original recommendation to terminate the council\u2019s recognition.

On Monday, The Times reported that Mr. Mueller is looking into contributions made to the Trump Foundation by the Ukrainian steel magnate Victor Pinchuk in exchange for a video campaign speech by Mr. Trump at a conference in Kiev, raising questions over whether Mr. Trump allowed the line to be blurred between charitable donations and political influence.\n\nMr. Mueller hasn\u2019t hinted at any conclusions, but it is clear that the Russian trolls indicted in February were able to run political advertisements on Facebook in part because of lax and under-enforced regulations that failed to constrain foreign spending in American elections. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, has argued that it will be difficult to restrict such spending in the future, even on grounds of national security, because stricter campaign finance legislation runs counter to the interests of donors on whom lawmakers rely for funds.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels.

(It\u2019s demoralizing to realize how much of American political history is animated not by the question of should there be slavery but rather should there be slavery in the West.)\n\nTo protest, for six years Thoreau did not pay his taxes. He asks, \u201cWhen I meet a government which says to me, \u2018Your money or your life,\u2019 why should I be in haste to give it my money?\u201d And so he went to jail \u2014 for a single night. \u201cFor some one\u201d \u2014 probably his aunt \u2014 \u201cinterfered, and paid that tax.\u201d\n\nRereading \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d annually, around tax time, is on the same to-do list as sending forms to my accountant and gathering the wadded-up receipts that suggest that my job is not writing but drinking tea in airports.

Just as it would be wrong to breed animals for the sake of torturing them, or to have children only to enslave them, it would be wrong to mistreat the conscious machines of the future.\n\nBut how will we know if our machines become conscious? Descartes argued that one\u2019s own consciousness is beyond any possibility of doubt. In the case of others, we\u2019re never absolutely sure. Many of us have entertained, if only for a moment, the idea that everyone else might be a zombie: laughing, crying, complaining, rejoicing, but with no one home. Perhaps scientists will eventually discover the signature of consciousness, and then we will be able to test for it in our robots, as well as in animals and one another. But it is certain that we will build machines that seem conscious long before we arrive at that point.\n\nAnything that looks and acts like the hosts on \u201cWestworld\u201d will appear conscious to us, whether or not we understand how consciousness emerges in physical systems. Indeed, experiments with AI and robotics have already shown how quick we are to attribute feelings to machines that look and behave like independent agents. Multiply that temptation to anthropomorphize a thousandfold: Think not of a machine with visible wires, cartoonish eyes and a voice that sounds like Siri but of a beautiful stranger who engages you in intelligent conversation and who may be more aware of your emotions than your spouse or best friends ever were. It would be irresistible to see this creature as a person, whatever your philosophical views and regardless of what its creators told you about how it was built.\n\nThis is where actually watching \u201cWestworld\u201d matters. The pleasure of entertainment aside, the makers of the series have produced a powerful work of philosophy. It\u2019s one thing to sit in a seminar and argue about what it would mean, morally, if robots were conscious. It\u2019s quite another to witness the torments of such creatures, as portrayed by actors such as Evan Rachel Wood and Thandie Newton. You may still raise the question intellectually, but in your heart and your gut, you already know the answer.\n\nWatching the show, you also discover how you feel about the people who rape, torture and kill these robots. We have no idea how many people would actually behave this way in a place like Westworld (the show implies that there\u2019s no shortage of such customers), but there is something repugnant about those who do. In this scenario, the robot hosts are the most human and the humans who abuse them are monsters.\n\nKant had odd views about animals, seeing them as mere things, devoid of moral value, but he insisted on their proper treatment because of the implications for how we treat one another: \u201cFor he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.\u201d We could surely say the same for the treatment of lifelike robots. Even if we could be certain that they weren\u2019t conscious and couldn\u2019t really suffer, their torture would very likely harm the torturer and, ultimately, the other people in his life.\n\nThis may seem like an extreme version of the worry that many have about violent video games. It has long been speculated that enacting violence in a virtual world desensitizes people to violence in the real one. The evidence for such an effect turns out to be weak. In fact, as video games have become increasingly realistic, the rate of violent crime has dropped.\n\nBut the prospect of building a place like \u201cWestworld\u201d is much more troubling, because the experience of harming a host isn\u2019t merely similar to that of harming a person; it\u2019s identical. We have no idea what repeatedly indulging such fantasies would do to us, ethically or psychologically \u2014 but there seems little reason to think that it would be good.", "title": "Opinion | It\u2019s Westworld.

He confirmed their utility as a monitoring tool, especially when paired with other methods.\n\n\u201cWe need as much information as we can possibly get if we are going to identify endangered species and head off the extinction crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers have traditionally made such identifications by catching animals, collecting hair or dung samples, or setting up camera traps. Capture stresses out and sometimes injures animal subjects, however, and hair and dung can be difficult to find.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCamera traps are the current gold standard in tropical rain forests, but they tend to require significant time and expense.\n\nIn the second study, published in The Journal of Applied Ecology and led by Ms. Weiskopf, then at the University of Delaware, the researchers aimed to compare camera traps to leech collection. The researchers set up 30 camera trap sites in four forest reserves in Bangladesh and captured 200 leeches in the same spots.\n\nWhile the leeches produced evidence of 12 species of mammals (including a small rodent, the Tanezumi rat, that the camera traps missed), the cameras documented 26 species. But Ms. Weiskopf pointed out that the cameras were rolling for nearly nine months, while the leeches were collected in just four days.\n\nSimply collecting a few more leeches, Ms. Weiskopf said, could potentially put the method on par with camera trapping \u2014 especially when time and money are taken into account. The leech work cost just $3,770, while the camera traps came in at $24,800.\n\nGiven these advantages, Ms. Weiskopf said, \u201cleeches could really complement some of our already existing biodiversity-monitoring methods, and move forward some existing biodiversity conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nFuture studies, Dr. Tessler added, could be made even more efficient by blending hundreds of leeches into a slurry and genetically sequencing all of their blood meals in one go.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how big this will become, but I think leeches have quite a bit of potential,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a fascinating method.\u201d", "title": "It\u2019s the Latest in Conservation Tech.

{"date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Guest, however, researching the archives of the Paris Opera, found the violin arrangement for a pas de deux that the ballerina Fanny Elssler had added to \u201cLa Fille\u201d in the 1830s; this music used items from Donizetti\u2019s opera \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore.\u201d\n\nThe conductor-composer John Lanchbery, who was working with Mr. Ashton, incorporated the piece into his new arrangement for \u201cLa Fille.\u201d The suite became known as \u201cthe Fanny Elssler pas de deux,\u201d and contains the ballet\u2019s greatest display of ebullient virtuosity.\n\nIvor Forbes Guest was born on April 20, 1920, in Chislehurst, Kent, England. As a lawyer he became a senior partner at Tweedie & Prideaux, with offices at Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields, London. But he was best known for historical research, and it was his birthplace that inspired him to follow his passion.\n\nAfter Mr. Guest learned that Napoleon III of France had spent his last days in Chislehurst, in the 1870s, he wrote \u201cNapoleon III in England,\u201d published in 1952. His enthusiasm for ballet led him to later investigate the ballet of Napoleon III\u2019s era.\n\nBallet also had triumphant periods in England, and Mr. Guest wrote a number books on 19th- and early-20th-century ballet in London. The most important of these is \u201cThe Romantic Ballet in England\u201d (1953), which covers the phenomenal period in the 1840s when the impresario Benjamin Lumley, hiring the young dancer-choreographer Jules Perrot as his ballet master, briefly made Her Majesty\u2019s Theater in London into a more prestigious center for ballet than the Paris Opera.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the young Queen Victoria often in the audience, the world\u2019s foremost ballerinas appeared there, sometimes in duets, trios and quartets, with Perrot making creative breakthroughs in terms of both narrative ballet and pure-dance divertissements.\n\nNonetheless, the Paris Opera Ballet generally remained the central institution of ballet as a professional art form for at least two centuries after its inception in 1672. Mr. Guest soon became the leading authority on the history of Parisian ballet, writing two overall histories \u2014 the first published in French, \u201cLe Ballet de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra de Paris\u201d (1976).\n\nMore valuable yet, and far more detailed, are his four books on individual periods of the Paris Opera Ballet. Though not written in the order of the eras they cover, they amount to a sequential tetralogy of the history of ballet at the Paris Opera between 1750 and 1870: \u201cThe Ballet of the Enlightenment\u201d (1996), \u201cBallet Under Napoleon\u201d (2001), \u201cThe Romantic Ballet in Paris\u201d (1966), and \u201cThe Ballet of the Second Empire, 1858-1870\u201d (1974), an amalgamation of two earlier books on the topic. In all of these books, Mr. Guest\u2019s tone is light and unassuming.\n\nWhile producing these broader surveys, he also wrote a series of biographies, including three on celebrated 19th-century ballerinas whose careers took them across Europe: \u201cFanny Cerrito\u201d (1956), \u201cFanny Elssler\u201d (1970) and \u201cThe Divine Virginia: The biography of Virginia Zucchi\u201d (1977).\n\nA later biography, \u201cJules Perrot\u201d (1984), was on the most prestigious choreographer of the 19th century. Perrot worked in Naples, Paris, London, Milan and St Petersburg, and Mr. Guest found a wealth of information about him in each city.\n\nIvor Guest and Ann Hutchinson were married in 1962. Ms. Guest is an eminent practitioner of the Laban system of dance notation, the detailed recording of movement in written scores similar to those of music. Their separate fields of endeavor made them respected figures in dance scholarship.\n\nThe couple spent part of each year in Massachusetts, where they were often seen in the audience at the Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance festival in the Berkshires. Ms. Guest is his only immediate survivor.\n\nIn addition to his writing career, Mr. Guest was an official adviser to two notable British institutions, the Royal Academy of Dance (he was its chairman from 1970 to 1993) and the monthly magazine \u201cDancing Times.\u201d His autobiographical \u201cAdventures of a Ballet Historian: An Unfinished Memoir,\u201d was published in 1981.\n\nIn 2000, he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France, which recognizes significant contributions to the arts and literature.", "title": "Ivor Guest, 97, Dies; Transformed Study of Dance History", "authors": ["Alastair Macaulay"]}

With me and the officer giving him contradictory instructions, he pulled into the restricted area.\n\nTwo cops approached and demanded his license.

The cop asked, \u201cAre you going to pay the ticket for him?\u201d Luckily, the N.Y.P.D. officers let the driver off with only a warning, but I wondered whether I would have been ethically responsible for paying his fine? I did instruct him to commit an illegal act, but it was because of his mistake and of almost taking me far out of my way. Further, he did not have to commit the illegal maneuver simply because I told him to. Had he gotten a ticket, I would have paid it because I have the means, but would it have been my ethical responsibility?\n\nAlex Ruttenberg, New Jersey\n\nIt was the driver\u2019s responsibility to understand the GPS; he shouldn\u2019t have offered to drive people if he didn\u2019t. Had you not known about the risks of being sucked into the maw of the Holland Tunnel, he would have been taking you for a long ride through New Jersey. Nevertheless, you might think commanding an immigrant driver into an altercation with a New York police officer risked a situation that could have escalated badly out of control.

Mr. Zuma was stripped of the presidency in February after losing a battle with his rival and eventual successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nOn Friday, national prosecutors, as well as Mr. Zuma\u2019s lawyers, asked for the postponement to prepare the case.", "title": "Jacob Zuma Appears in Court for South Africa Corruption Trial", "authors": []}

Khan said that by selling the stadium, the soccer body would be able to invest in its core aims of developing talent for England\u2019s national teams and enhancing the sport at grass-roots levels.\n\nAfter details of Khan\u2019s bid emerged Thursday, the F.A. chairman, Greg Clarke, wrote to the organization\u2019s 92-member advisory group. In the letter, seen by The New York Times, Clarke noted that the F.A. did not own the stadium before 1999, and that there would be an \u201cimmediate and significant\u201d cash influx that could be invested into facilities at all levels of the sport. He pointed out the sale would allow Wembley to \u201cremain the home of the F.A. and English football,\u201d while creating the option of taking the national men\u2019s team on the road, something it has been unable to do because of the need to pay off construction costs.\n\n\u201cIf we are to progress such a deal there would of course be many challenges, and I am well aware that it will be an emotive issue that will divide opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is, however, a unique opportunity.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One member of the council, contacted by The New York Times, said he was instinctively opposed to selling.\n\n\u201cWhy would you sell it?\u201d he said. \u201cEverywhere you go in the world they talk about Wembley.\u201d He insisted on anonymity because he did not want to appear to be speaking for the council.\n\nWembley has become a second home for the Jaguars. In 2015, Khan signed a deal to play at least one game a year there through 2020. Those London roots, and the Jaguars\u2019 occupying one of the N.F.L.\u2019s smallest markets, have long created the suspicion that the team would one day pursue a move to London, becoming the first N.F.L. team to be based outside of North America.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Khan said the offer should be seen as an effort to strengthen the Jaguars\u2019 fortunes in Jacksonville, rather than a harbinger of a permanent move away from Florida.\n\n\u201cFor the Jaguars,\u201d he said, acquiring Wembley \u201cwould deliver another \u2014 and very significant \u2014 asset and local revenue source that would further strengthen our investment in London, which as everyone knows is crucial to the Jaguars\u2019 continued sustainability in Jacksonville. In every respect, the Jaguars\u2019 standing in London would be improved and dramatically enhanced if we are fortunate to be approved as the new owner and steward of Wembley Stadium, and that\u2019s good news for the Jaguars and all of Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKhan said the potential acquisition would not affect his ownership of West London-based Fulham, which is battling for a return to the Premier League.

Margaret\u2019s great passion is for research on migrating ponies in the Chesapeake Bay area.

Charlie\u2019s best friend becomes fellow Congressman Isaiah Street, a former Tuskegee Airman who is technically banned from even eating with his peers in the official dining room. Isaiah, not someone to be interfered with, just ignores this rule. But Tapper uses him \u2014 and the upcoming Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education \u2014 to underscore where Americans stood on racial equality in 1954. That, too, is a sobering message for these retrograde times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTapper\u2019s odd little observations are much more interesting than his broad ones. He apparently has a highly developed snoot: He makes multiple mentions of fragrances that were popular in the 1950s, and even manages to weave one into the suspense plot. He has Charlie attend the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, a.k.a. the comic book hearings, which were detailed in David Hajdu\u2019s \u201cThe Ten-Cent Plague\u201d (2008). This is useful as a precursor to later examples of congressional alarmism; Charlie also gleans tactical advice from the proceedings. Tapper also recalls a mostly forgotten invasion of the Capitol by armed Puerto Rican separatists that yielded the casualties described in this novel. Tapper\u2019s awkwardness with his fictitious characters can improve. His acuity with historical resonance doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nTapper did not have to include endnotes clarifying facts he modified and details on sources, but the notes are very winning. They reveal his tremendous enthusiasm for this work, a near-excessive meticulousness (the book\u2019s wild ponies of Nanticoke and Susquehannock Islands are loosely based on Chincoteague and Assateague ponies) and things that probably didn\u2019t need mentioning (the dishonest congressman called Phil Strongfellow is a lot like the real Douglas Stringfellow).\n\nFinally, a conversation between Charlie and Eisenhower at the end of the book \u2014 by which time reader resistance to its wax-museum politicians has been worn down \u2014 turns out to have been derived from Eisenhower\u2019s memoir, his farewell address, an article about his Oval Office\u2019s d\u00e9cor, Stephen Ambrose\u2019s book about Ike and espionage, David Nichols\u2019s book about Ike and McCarthy, and more. All this for a single chapter about setting the course for Charlie\u2019s future. At long last he\u2019s grown into his role.

Comey: By the Book]\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,\u201d Comey writes, \u201cwith a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Higher Loyalty\u201d is the first big memoir by a key player in the alarming melodrama that is the Trump administration. Comey, who was abruptly fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, has worked in three administrations, and his book underscores just how outside presidential norms Trump\u2019s behavior has been \u2014 how ignorant he is about his basic duties as president, and how willfully he has flouted the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy, including the essential independence of the judiciary and law enforcement. Comey\u2019s book fleshes out the testimony he gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017 with considerable emotional detail, and it showcases its author\u2019s gift for narrative \u2014 a skill he clearly honed during his days as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe volume offers little in the way of hard news revelations about investigations by the F.B.I. or the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III (not unexpectedly, given that such investigations are ongoing and involve classified material), and it lacks the rigorous legal analysis that made Jack Goldsmith\u2019s 2007 book \u201cThe Terror Presidency\u201d so incisive about larger dynamics within the Bush administration.\n\nWhat \u201cA Higher Loyalty\u201d does give readers are some near-cinematic accounts of what Comey was thinking when, as he\u2019s previously said, Trump demanded loyalty from him during a one-on-one dinner at the White House; when Trump pressured him to let go of the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn; and when the president asked what Comey could do to \u201clift the cloud\u201d of the Russia investigation.\n\nThere are some methodical explanations in these pages of the reasoning behind the momentous decisions Comey made regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails during the 2016 campaign \u2014 explanations that attest to his nonpartisan and well-intentioned efforts to protect the independence of the F.B.I., but that will leave at least some readers still questioning the judgment calls he made, including the different approaches he took in handling the bureau\u2019s investigation into Clinton (which was made public) and its investigation into the Trump campaign (which was handled with traditional F.B.I. secrecy).\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cA Higher Loyalty\u201d also provides sharp sketches of key players in three presidential administrations. Comey draws a scathing portrait of Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s legal adviser David S. Addington, who spearheaded the arguments of many hard-liners in the George W. Bush White House; Comey describes their point of view: \u201cThe war on terrorism justified stretching, if not breaking, the written law.\u201d He depicts Bush national security adviser and later Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as uninterested in having a detailed policy discussion of interrogation policy and the question of torture. He takes Barack Obama\u2019s attorney general Loretta Lynch to task for asking him to refer to the Clinton email case as a \u201cmatter,\u201d not an \u201cinvestigation.\u201d (Comey tartly notes that \u201cthe F.B.I. didn\u2019t do \u2018matters.\u2019\u201d) And he compares Trump\u2019s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to Alberto R. Gonzales, who served in the same position under Bush, writing that both were \u201coverwhelmed and overmatched by the job,\u201d but \u201cSessions lacked the kindness Gonzales radiated.\u201d\n\nComey is what Saul Bellow called a \u201cfirst-class noticer.\u201d He notices, for instance, \u201cthe soft white pouches under\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cexpressionless blue eyes\u201d; coyly observes that the president\u2019s hands are smaller than his own \u201cbut did not seem unusually so\u201d; and points out that he never saw Trump laugh \u2014 a sign, Comey suspects, of his \u201cdeep insecurity, his inability to be vulnerable or to risk himself by appreciating the humor of others, which, on reflection, is really very sad in a leader, and a little scary in a president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring his Senate testimony last June, Comey was boy-scout polite (\u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes\u201d) and somewhat elliptical in explaining why he decided to write detailed memos after each of his encounters with Trump (something he did not do with Presidents Obama or Bush), talking gingerly about \u201cthe nature of the person I was interacting with.\u201d Here, however, Comey is blunt about what he thinks of the president, comparing Trump\u2019s demand for loyalty over dinner to \u201cSammy the Bull\u2019s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony \u2014 with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a \u2018made man.\u2019\u201d\n\nThroughout his tenure in the Bush and Obama administrations (he served as deputy attorney general under Bush, and was selected to lead the F.B.I. by Obama in 2013), Comey was known for his fierce, go-it-alone independence, and Trump\u2019s behavior catalyzed his worst fears \u2014 that the president symbolically wanted the leaders of the law enforcement and national security agencies to come \u201cforward and kiss the great man\u2019s ring.\u201d Comey was feeling unnerved from the moment he met Trump. In his recent book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d Michael Wolff wrote that Trump \u201cinvariably thought people found him irresistible,\u201d and felt sure, early on, that \u201che could woo and flatter the F.B.I. director into positive feeling for him, if not outright submission\u201d (in what the reader takes as yet another instance of the president\u2019s inability to process reality or step beyond his own narcissistic delusions).\n\nAfter he failed to get that submission and the Russia cloud continued to hover, Trump fired Comey; the following day he told Russian officials during a meeting in the Oval Office that firing the F.B.I. director \u2014 whom he called \u201ca real nut job\u201d \u2014 relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him. A week later, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nDuring Comey\u2019s testimony, one senator observed that the often contradictory accounts that the president and former F.B.I. director gave of their one-on-one interactions came down to \u201cWho should we believe?\u201d As a prosecutor, Comey replied, he used to tell juries trying to evaluate a witness that \u201cyou can\u2019t cherry-pick\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018I like these things he said, but on this, he\u2019s a dirty, rotten liar.\u2019 You got to take it all together.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ashcroft, to prevent Bush White House officials from persuading the ailing Ashcroft to reauthorize an N.S.A. surveillance program that members of the Justice Department believed violated the law.\n\nOne uses language incoherently on Twitter and in person, emitting a relentless stream of lies, insults, boasts, dog-whistles, divisive appeals to anger and fear, and attacks on institutions, individuals, companies, religions, countries, continents.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe other chooses his words carefully to make sure there is \u201cno fuzz\u201d to what he is saying, someone so self-conscious about his reputation as a person of integrity that when he gave his colleague James R. Clapper, then director of national intelligence, a tie decorated with little martini glasses, he made sure to tell him it was a regift from his brother-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne is an impulsive, utterly transactional narcissist who, so far in office, The Washington Post calculated, has made an average of six false or misleading claims a day; a winner-take-all bully with a nihilistic view of the world. \u201cBe paranoid,\u201d he advises in one of his own books. In another: \u201cWhen somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.\u201d\n\nThe other wrote his college thesis on religion and politics, embracing Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s argument that \u201cthe Christian must enter the political realm in some way\u201d in order to pursue justice, which keeps \u201cthe strong from consuming the weak.\u201d\n\nUntil his cover was blown, Comey shared nature photographs on Twitter using the name \u201cReinhold Niebuhr,\u201d and both his 1982 thesis and this memoir highlight how much Niebuhr\u2019s work resonated with him. They also attest to how a harrowing experience he had as a high school senior \u2014 when he and his brother were held captive, in their parents\u2019 New Jersey home, by an armed gunman \u2014 must have left him with a lasting awareness of justice and mortality.\n\nLong passages in Comey\u2019s thesis are also devoted to explicating the various sorts of pride that Niebuhr argued could afflict human beings \u2014 most notably, moral pride and spiritual pride, which can lead to the sin of self-righteousness. And in \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d Comey provides an inventory of his own flaws, writing that he can be \u201cstubborn, prideful, overconfident and driven by ego.\u201d\n\nThose characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comey\u2019s account of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, wherein he seems to have felt a moral imperative to address, in a July 2016 press conference, what he described as her \u201cextremely careless\u201d handling of \u201cvery sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d even though he went on to conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her. His announcement marked a departure from precedent in that it was done without coordination with Department of Justice leadership and offered more detail about the bureau\u2019s evaluation of the case than usual.\n\nAs for his controversial disclosure on Oct. 28, 2016, 11 days before the election, that the F.B.I. was reviewing more Clinton emails that might be pertinent to its earlier investigation, Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win. He has repeatedly asked himself, he writes, whether he was influenced by that assumption: \u201cIt is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls.

His reply was blunt: He did not trust the leaders of the Justice Department, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to effectively and fairly carry out such an investigation themselves.\n\nIn his mind, Mr. Sessions would soon be recused from the Russia investigation, rendering him ineffectual, and Mr. Rosenstein had shown himself to be untrustworthy because of his role in firing Mr. Comey.\n\nIt was Mr. Rosenstein who had written a memo to the president laying out the reasons Mr. Comey should be fired. \u201cI did not have confidence that it would be done in the right way,\u201d Mr. Comey said.\n\nComey kind of wishes he were still the F.B.I. director.\n\n\u201cMy plan was to stay,\u201d Mr. Comey told me, when I asked if he wished he were still the director of the F.B.I.

He also explained why he decided to write a book criticizing President Trump. Comey\u2019s book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d hit stores on Tuesday.\n\nComey admitted to Colbert that he had been surprised by his firing, given that he was leading an investigation that had to do with the Trump campaign\u2019s own dealings with Russia.\n\nCOMEY: I actually was quite surprised, because I thought, \u2018I\u2019m leading the Russia investigation.\u2019 Even though our relationship was becoming strained, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to get fired or whacked. COLBERT: Why? Why wouldn\u2019t you get fired? COMEY: Because that would be a crazy thing to do. Why would you fire the F.B.I. director who is leading the Russia investigation? COLBERT: Because you\u2019re leading the Russia investigation! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve dealt with mob bosses before, but they don\u2019t like to be investigated.\n\nIn recent days Trump has been furiously tweeting about Comey, even suggesting he should be put in jail. Comey told Colbert that the episode seemed to reflect the reasons he decided to write \u201cA Higher Loyalty\u201d: to remind the country that it should not take the president\u2019s public acts too lightly.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction to those kinds of tweets is a shrug \u2014 like, \u2018Oh, there he goes again.\u2019 But actually then I caught myself and I said, \u2018Wait a minute. If I\u2019m shrugging, are the rest of the country shrugging? And does that mean we\u2019ve become numb to this?\u2019 It\u2019s not O.K. for the president of the United States to say a private citizen should be in jail. It\u2019s not normal, it\u2019s not acceptable, it\u2019s not O.K. But it\u2019s happened so much, there\u2019s a danger we\u2019re now numb to it, and the norm has been destroyed.

He\u2019s also a longtime friend of Mr. Trump.\n\nAre North Korean sanctions enough?\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no doubt that the latest U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang are causing pain that earlier measures did not.\n\nLess clear is whether the pressure is forcing the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to make concessions, and whether it\u2019s enough to persuade him to give up his nuclear arsenal. Our correspondent in South Korea explains.\n\nOn Thursday, the North dropped its longtime demand that the U.S. withdraw its 28,500 troops from the Korean Peninsula, according to the South\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in. But U.S. officials don\u2019t consider that a concession.\n\n\u2022 Economic pressure alone might not bring change: \u201cIf you think the North Koreans would revolt or the regime would collapse because of sanctions, you don\u2019t know anything about the North Koreans,\u201d one defector said.\n\nNo charges in Prince\u2019s death\n\n\u2022 Almost exactly two years after the musician accidentally overdosed on the painkiller fentanyl, the authorities in Minnesota said on Thursday that no one would be criminally charged.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have no direct evidence that a specific person provided the fentanyl to Prince,\u201d a county attorney said, adding that the investigation uncovered \u201cno sinister motive, intent or conspiracy to murder Prince.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A doctor who treated the musician just before his death, at 57, has agreed to pay $30,000 to settle a federal civil violation for an illegal prescription.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Daily Listen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: James Comey on Ego, Distrust and More In an interview with Michael Barbaro, the former F.B.I. director explains his decision to make public his notes of his interactions with President Trump.

{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "By the time ABC aired an hourlong interview with James B. Comey on Sunday night, his feelings on President Trump were clear: that he was volatile, immoral, fixated on allegations made against him, akin to a mob boss.\n\nWhen excerpts from Mr. Comey\u2019s forthcoming memoir emerged last week, Mr. Trump pounced, labeling Mr. Comey \u201cweak\u201d and an \u201cuntruthful slime ball.\u201d He later suggested Mr. Comey deserved jail time.\n\nThe disclosures in the book, many of which were amplified in extraordinary detail in Sunday\u2019s interview, were a stunning assault on a sitting president by a former high-ranking law enforcement official.\n\n[Read our full coverage of the interview \u00bb]\n\nThe ABC interview, conducted by the anchor George Stephanopoulos and filmed at Mr. Comey\u2019s Virginia home, was the first major interview the former F.B.I. director has granted since his firing last May.", "title": "James Comey\u2019s ABC Interview: Five Highlights", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cIn a time when almost every public debate is defined by people lining up with their respective tribes,\u201d Mr. Steel added, \u201che\u2019s managed to alienate both.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey, in remarks promoting the book, says he is trying to rouse the country to see Mr. Trump through the lens of \u201cethical leadership,\u201d arguing that the president \u201cdoes not reflect the values\u201d of Democrats, Republicans or independents. Asked on ABC if Mr. Trump should be impeached, Mr. Comey said he hoped it would not happen because voters were \u201cduty bound\u201d to \u201cgo to the voting booth and vote their values.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey has cast himself as a truth-teller before, sometimes to the irritation of colleagues or superiors. He threatened to quit his job at the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration rather than sign off on a domestic surveillance program the White House demanded, and he refused Mr. Trump\u2019s entreaties to back off of the investigation of Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey a few months later, calling him a \u201cgrandstander\u201d and citing the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into his administration\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\n\u201cAfter he was fired, he finally became the martyr he always held himself out to be,\u201d said Matthew A. Miller, who served as a top Justice Department official under President Obama when Mr. Comey led the F.B.I. \u201cBy doing a tour like this where you kind of get down in the gutter the way he has, you sacrifice your claim on being a martyr.\u201d\n\nEven before the release of his book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d the White House, working in concert with the Republican National Committee, began an all-out campaign to besmirch \u201cLyin\u2019 Comey\u201d \u2014 the name of a website the party created to make the case \u2014 as dishonest, self-serving and driven by partisanship. But with his one-liners and cutting asides about the president, Mr. Comey only appeared to play into the hands of allies of Mr. Trump, who are eager to paint the former F.B.I. director as just another figure working for the president\u2019s defeat.\n\nAnd Mr. Comey has drawn bipartisan criticism with his latest efforts to explain \u2014 and, to some degree, recast \u2014 his much-criticized handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic pollster, said Mr. Comey\u2019s standing had been undermined by the one-two punch of liberal attacks over his role in the 2016 election and the more recent assault led by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies.\n\n\u201cTrump has tried to define him as a bad operator, and the problem for Comey is that you can quote a lot of Democrats saying the same,\u201d Mr. Mellman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt this point, it seems unlikely that Mr. Comey\u2019s book or his performance in interviews to promote it will sway public opinion in a country that is already intensely polarized along partisan lines. Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings have been similar for months, and the roughly 40 percent of Americans who support him have proven remarkably unshakable, while the 56 percent who disapprove will probably not change their views on Mr. Comey's account.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mueller III, the special counsel probing Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, is sure to eventually overshadow his memoir.\n\n\u201cIt keeps the story of cover-ups and corruption on the public radar while Mueller is doing his investigation, but Comey is just a pit stop along the way of that,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic strategist. \u201cMuch to Comey\u2019s chagrin, his moment has passed. There\u2019s nothing in this book we don\u2019t already know. He just adds one more hole to a ship that\u2019s already sinking.\u201d\n\nMr. Comey plainly considers himself to be a figure who is above the political fray, driven and guided solely by facts. His friends and advisers say he wants the book to stir a conversation about the value of honesty.\n\n\u201cTelling the truth should not be seen as a political act,\u201d said Keith Urbahn, Mr. Comey\u2019s book agent. \u201cIt should just be the truth.\u201d\n\nYet there is a twist: While he professes to be uneasy with the country\u2019s growing polarization and appears to disdain partisanship, Mr. Comey has in effect weaponized himself against a Republican president by calling for him to be voted out of office. Mr. Comey may not want to be used as anybody\u2019s \u201cpolitical battering ram,\u201d as one associate put it, but he recognizes that is precisely how his book will be deployed.\n\nFriends say Mr. Comey expected his memoir would be criticized because of how it would inevitably be construed: either as airbrushing history and not being honest about Mr. Trump\u2019s transgressions, or as a self-serving and score-settling account with the man who ended his career in law enforcement.\n\nStill, Mr. Comey\u2019s former colleagues rejected any notion that he has transformed himself into a political actor or hurt his reputation.\n\n\u201cJim Comey is as upright, honest and decent a person and public servant as I have ever met,\u201d said Jack Goldsmith, who served with him in the Bush Justice Department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for his willingness to engage in Trumpian insults, invoking the size of the president\u2019s hands, his allies argue that he is simply attempting to paint vivid scenes and does the same with the other presidents he served.\n\nMr. Miller, however, said Mr. Comey tends to be \u201cat his best when he\u2019s coloring inside the lines and following the rules,\u201d as prosecutors are trained to do.\n\n\u201cWhat you see in the book is not just a factual recitation, but also a lot of spin on the ball,\u201d he said.", "title": "James Comey\u2019s Attacks on Trump May Hurt a Carefully Cultivated Image", "authors": ["Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Jonathan Martin"]}

(This was easy for him to do as he is, famously, 6-foot-8.)\n\nMr. Comey, by now a bona fide bipartisan pariah, was sipping California pinot noir from a paper cup and celebrating the remarkable success of his juicy new memoir, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d with perhaps the last crowd left in town who will gladly have him: journalists.\n\nIn a city not known for snappy dressing, Mr. Comey cut a sharp figure in a bespoke blue plaid suit made by the haberdasher The Tailored Man of Alexandria, Va., and brown R.M. Williams Chelsea boots he says were given to him by friends from the Australian police force (not to be confused with the black Chelsea boots Mr. Comey wore for his prime time \u201c20/20\u201d interview, which earned him plaudits from Esquire and GQ).\n\nAs a late-April rain lashed the museum\u2019s panoramic windows, the man of the hour cheerily recounted tales from his whirlwind media tour. \u201cThe clutch of people coming up to me in airports, that\u2019s probably the hardest thing to get used to,\u201d he said.", "title": "James Comey\u2019s Book Party Was Larded With Journalists", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-15 00:00:00", "text": "On Trump\u2019s Monologues\n\n\u2018It was him talking almost the entire time.\u2019\n\nIt was him talking almost the entire time, which I\u2019ve discovered is something he frequently does. And so it would be monologue in this direction, monologue in that direction, monologue in a different direction. And a constant series of assertions that \u2014 about the inauguration crowd, about how great my inauguration speech was, about all the free media \u2014 earned media, I think was his term, that I got during the campaign. On and on and on and on. Everyone agrees, everyone agrees, I did this, the \u2014 I never assaulted these women, I never made fun of a reporter. And \u2014 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering what question did I ask that would prompt those? None, zero. I didn\u2019t ask any questions that I recall.\n\nOne of the most interesting observations by Mr. Comey during the interview was that Mr. Trump delivers monologues that are intended to leave the impression that those listening agree completely with him.\n\nMr. Comey notes on several occasions that in private conversations, the president simply makes assertions \u2014 often falsely \u2014 without giving the people he\u2019s talking to a chance to interject or object. It\u2019s an interesting observation because it is similar to what Mr. Trump does in public.\n\nWhen he is giving remarks to a small group around a table at the White House, he often rambles from one topic to the next, making assertions that often are not true but cannot be challenged at the time because they come in such rapid-fire fashion.\n\nAnd Mr. Comey notes that the president often says contradictory things in the same monologue. He noted that over dinner, the president told him that Reince Priebus, the chief of staff at the time, didn\u2019t know they were having dinner together. But later, Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey to follow up with Mr. Priebus, who knew they were having dinner together.\n\n\u201cOne of those things is not true. One of those things is a lie,\u201d Mr. Comey says in the interview.\n\nOn Those Who Work With the President\n\n\u2018He will stain everyone around him.\u2019\n\nThe challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d Pallotta said. \u201cPeople just going bananas.\u201d\n\nHe did not leave the Stadio Olimpico for some time that night. There were news media interviews to do, guests to greet, each of them passing on breathless congratulations. He went to the locker room to celebrate with his players and his coach, Eusebio Di Francesco.\n\nIt was deep into the small hours of Wednesday morning when he arrived back at the steps of his hotel, the Hotel de Russie, around the corner from Piazza del Popolo. He has stayed there on every visit to Rome since he took control of the club, in 2012. When he returned, the Roma fans among the staff were decked out in the club\u2019s colors \u2014 yellow and a red verging on burnt orange \u2014 to welcome him.\n\n\u201cOne of them, Alessandro, told me that there were thousands of people on the piazza,\u201d Pallotta said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You go, you go.\u2019 \u201d Pallotta obeyed. On the way, a member of his coterie suggested he should jump in the fountain that sits in the center of the square. Pallotta, 60, thought it sounded like a great idea.\n\nHe took off his jacket and removed his cellphone and credit cards from his pockets: This, it turns out, was not his first rodeo. He strolled up to the fountain, sat on its lip, and tumbled in. \u201cAnd then I thought: Let\u2019s get something to eat,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was only later, in his hotel room, that it occurred to him that Rome\u2019s authorities do not take kindly to people jumping in its fountains. On Wednesday, he apologized to the city\u2019s mayor and accepted his $280 fine. He also pledged $280,000 to help restore another fountain, in front of the Pantheon.\n\n\u201cI do not condone people jumping in fountains,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you do, you should pay to fix them.\u201d\n\nTuesday night was that kind of night in Rome. Roma had not reached the last four of the European Cup since 1984, and few had given the team a hope against mighty Barcelona, against Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez and the rest. \u201cWhen the draw was made, all of the Spanish newspapers said it was easy,\u201d Pallotta said. \u201cOne of the headlines was \u2018Roman Candy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time he had eaten, dried off and gone to bed, he could still hear gleeful fans singing in the streets. It was the sort of night, in other words, when the billionaire American owner of an Italian soccer team jumping into a fountain felt like a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d\n\nIf Pallotta\u2019s celebration was exuberant, though, the work that made it possible was significantly cooler-headed. Since taking control almost six years ago \u2014 he first invested in Roma, in a minority, passive role, in 2008 \u2014 Pallotta has done all he can to turn what was once a debt-ridden, chaotic club into a sleek, sophisticated outfit.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt seems a strange gauge, but Roma\u2019s approach to social media and its business endeavors offer an insight into Pallotta\u2019s vision.\n\nIn 2015, the club recruited Paul Rogers from a similar role at Liverpool to oversee its digital content. Last summer, Rogers\u2019s team produced a run of videos during the transfer window that went viral: a spoof of the ubiquitous, homemade highlight reels that litter YouTube; a film of midfielder Lorenzo Pellegrini playing as himself on the video game FIFA; a pastiche of a video made by Southampton to skewer Roma\u2019s own satirical announcements, featuring quite a lot of goats. Rogers described Roma as \u201cowning weirdness.\u201d\n\nFunny as those films were, the strategy was significant. Pallotta, like many American owners in soccer, sees his team as a content company. The premium content, of course, is the sport itself, but that is just one element. \u201cIf you want to be a worldwide brand, you have to create content 24/7,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nPallotta now believes Roma creates more content than most of its peers. Its website was named Best in Class at last year\u2019s Interactive Media Awards. It is, Pallotta said, one of the \u201cfastest growing teams in social and digital media.\u201d Roma is starting to rival clubs of far greater resources and historical scope.\n\nThat is not the only advancement. Roma has recruited specialists in ticketing, marketing and branding, a quiet revolution in the staid, conservative world of Italian soccer. Pallotta hopes to break ground on a new stadium, after considerable delays, in December; it will be an entertainment and retail venue, and he believes it will be one of the most-used facilities in Europe.\n\nRoma is also investigating machine-learning to try to refine its scouting processes. Pallotta hired a Canadian statistician, Luke Bornn, as head of data, analytics and software, then replaced him last year with a Scot, Stephen McCarthy.\n\nThe work is still in its comparative infancy, but proved crucial in Pallotta\u2019s greatest coup: tempting Monchi, the longtime sporting director of the Spanish side Sevilla, and widely regarded as a man with a golden touch in the transfer market, to Rome last year. Monchi, Pallotta explained, had pursued in Seville a version of what Roma was trying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMonchi was impressed when he saw what Pallotta\u2019s data scientists were doing at their Boston war room. \u201cHe saw that we could take what he was thinking and bring it to fruition,\u201d said Pallotta, who is confident that Roma\u2019s analytics work is more sophisticated than that of \u201c99 percent\u201d of its peers.\n\nThere is, here, a parallel with one of the three teams that Roma might face in the Champions League semifinals. Pallotta has known John W. Henry and Tom Werner of Fenway Sports Group, owner of Liverpool, for years. Henry, whose own team knocked off Manchester City on Tuesday, called Pallotta to offer congratulations after Roma\u2019s defeat of Barcelona. \u201cI missed the call,\u201d Pallotta said. \u201cI think I was in the fountain.\u201d\n\nF.S.G. has spent much of its tenure aware that it cannot outspend clubs backed by vast commercial revenues, oligarchs or sovereign wealth funds, just as Roma cannot hope to compete financially with Juventus, at least while the new stadium remains mired in red tape.\n\nThough it has taken several missteps, F.S.G., too, has discovered that it has to be smarter than its rivals, if it cannot be richer. It has adopted a data-driven recruitment strategy, revamped its commercial team and found new ways of monetizing its passionate support. Manager Jurgen Klopp, hired in 2015, has helped plenty, too.\n\nThe reward, for both, is a place in the final four of the world\u2019s most prestigious club competition. Both would, of course, reject the assertion that they were punching above their weight \u2014 Liverpool has won the European Cup five times \u2014 but, in financial terms, both remain underdogs when compared with their prospective opponents, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, and their recent victims, Manchester City and Barcelona.\n\nThat they are both here, within touching distance of a final, of glory, is vindication for all they have done; it also offers hope to others that the latter stages of the Champions League are not an entirely closed shop.\n\nNot that Pallotta, at least, is quite satisfied. Not long after he took charge of Roma, he gathered together the club\u2019s staff at its training facility, Trigoria. He gave a presentation outlining his ambition for the team, then spoke with another 150 or so employees outside, by another fountain.\n\n\u201cI said that at the end of the day, all I wanted was to be celebrating titles with them by jumping in the fountains of Rome,\u201d he remembered. He took that as his cue, and duly leapt into the water. \u201cI thought it was heated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. This was the middle of January.\u201d\n\nShould Roma reach the final, should the unthinkable happen, Rome\u2019s mayor can expect another apology, and another donation, by the end of May.", "title": "James Pallotta Soaks In Roma\u2019s Stunning Win", "authors": ["Rory Smith", "On Soccer"]}

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Dimon made a point of saying that part of the problems facing the country is that too many people are talking past each other.\n\n\u201cWhen people argue as if there are binary solutions, the argument is almost always wrong,\u201d he wrote, advocating that people try to look at all sides of a situation. \u201cI tell my liberal friends to read columnists like Arthur Brooks and George Will. And I tell my conservative friends to read writers like Tom Friedman.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Dimon were to run, he would likely have to do so as an independent. It is hard to see how liberal Democrats would embrace much of his deregulatory positions. And yet many of his positions \u2013 and especially some of his social positions not enunciated in his letter \u2014 may not be far right enough to capture the interest of Republicans.\n\nMaybe the country needs someone in the middle, but history has not been kind to third-party candidates.\n\n\u2014 Andrew Ross Sorkin\n\nDimon chafes under liquidity rules.\n\nJamie Dimon, in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shareholders, had much to say about political issues like trade and immigration.\n\nBut he also addressed a policy area much closer to home \u2013 bank regulation. Mr. Dimon often has expressed skepticism about aspects of the banking overhaul that took place in the wake of the financial crisis. But his remarks on regulation arguably carry more weight now. Congress is closer to modifying the post-crisis rules than at any point since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010. An important regulatory requirement Mr. Dimon criticized, therefore, might become a focus for those wanting to roll back the rules.\n\nMr. Dimon in this year\u2019s letter zeroed in on regulations that require banks to have a certain amount of liquidity, the financial term for access to cash or low-risk assets that can be easily sold for cash.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2008, some large financial firms were crippled when customers, depositors and creditors withdrew their money. The Federal Reserve and taxpayers had to step in to support the banks. To help prevent a repeat of this, post-crisis rules require that banks hold a certain amount of liquid assets to cover a theoretical level of outflows. Mr. Dimon is in favor of banks having more liquidity than before the crisis, but in the letter, released Thursday, he wrote:\n\nLiquidity requirements, while much higher, now have an element of rigidity built in that did not exist before. Banks will be unable to use that liquidity when they most need to do so \u2014 to make loans or intermediate markets. They have a \u201cred line\u201d they cannot cross (they are required to maintain hard and fast liquidity requirements). As clients demand more liquidity from their banks, the banks essentially will be unable to provide it.\n\nNotably, legislation currently in Congress would tweak liquidity rules. If it passes, bankers may press for more loosening. And, as they have before, bank lobbyists may deploy Mr. Dimon\u2019s main argument here \u2013 that regulation can lead to less lending. But there are flaws in this line of attack, especially when it comes to liquidity rules.\n\nFirst, a bank that lacks liquidity is in no position to lend. When a bank\u2019s creditors and customers fear it doesn\u2019t have enough cash in reserve, they will most likely withdraw their money. This not only deprives the bank of the money it needs to lend, it also sharply reduces its chance of survival. Or as Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress puts it, \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to take this action if you fail.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Mr. Dimon leaves out some crucial context. Congress designed the whole post-crisis overhaul to ensure that banks have the funds on hand to lend during a downturn. Dodd-Frank\u2019s architects saw that when banks stop lending, it makes a recession far worse. And that is one reason why banks now have much higher levels of capital. Regulators expect that they will use up some of that capital to keep lending through the economic tumult. This is why the Federal Reserve said after its last bank stress tests:\n\nThe nation\u2019s largest bank holding companies have strong capital levels and retain their ability to lend to households and businesses during a severe recession.\n\nAndrew Gray, a JPMorgan spokesman, followed up with more material on Mr. Dimon\u2019s thinking on liquidity.\n\nHe re-emphasized Mr. Dimon\u2019s point about having to tie up funds that could be used to make loans. Mr. Gray noted that a bank facing outflows would be expected to keep refilling its pool of liquid assets to be in compliance with a liquidity regulation. This would leave fewer funds for lending and making markets, Mr. Gray asserted.\n\nHe also addressed the argument that higher capital levels, not liquidity, will largely determine the extent to which banks will lend through a downturn. Mr. Gray asserted that liquidity rules play an important role in ensuring banks have the resources to participate in wider financial markets. Rules forcing the hoarding of liquidity may, thus, crimp that activity.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nYou get a raise. You get a raise.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending.\u201d He even submitted a quarterly budget request recently of $0.\n\nThat attitude apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.\n\nMr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request.\n\n\u2022 Kirsten Sutton was hired in January to be the agency\u2019s chief of staff. Mr. Mulvaney agreed to pay her $259,500 a year. Her salary is the highest allowed under the consumer bureau\u2019s pay scale and represents a raise of more than 50 percent working for one of the C.F.P.B.\u2019s fiercest critics, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. It is also 22 percent more than her predecessor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Brian Johnson is another new deputy. In late December, Mr. Mulvaney signed paperwork that awarded Mr. Johnson a salary of $239,595. Mr. Johnson previously worked on the House Financial Services Committee. In his most recent job there, as policy director, he earned about $170,000 a year, according to LegiStorm. Of the 20 people at the bureau with the title of senior adviser, Mr. Johnson is the second-highest paid. (Another adviser, whose name wasn\u2019t disclosed in the public records reviewed by The Times, is paid $240,000.)\n\nContext\n\nThe consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.\n\nAs a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.\n\n\u2014 Stacy Cowley\n\nPhoto\n\nGun-free funds.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, plans to offer a series of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms.\n\nThey include:\n\n\u2022 a new exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms.\n\n\u2022 a similar credit-focused ETF that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.\n\n\u2022 an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 and three others.\n\nCritic\u2019s corner\n\nRob Cox of Breakigviews writes:\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s moves may spark criticism from gun-rights supporters, who lashed out at companies like Delta Air Lines that severed ties with the National Rifle Association.

They understand that when Kim Jong-un is talking about denuclearization he doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same thing that we mean, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure to just put the brakes on, be cautious, make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hornung, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut if Mr. Kim offered, for example, to extend a testing freeze for a year but insisted the United States set aside any demands about the abductees, \u201cwould Trump say, \u2018Nope, sorry, you\u2019ve got to do the abduction issue too?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hornung said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Trump, who wants a success here and who really wants the big win, throwing away any big deal on denuclearization or missiles for the sake of a Japanese priority,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Moon has also said he would raise the issue of the Japanese abductees in his meeting with Mr. Kim on Friday.\n\nBut with South Korea talking about negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, analysts said Japan would be watching closely for signs of concessions on a bigger issue: the United States military presence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAlthough Mr. Kim has said he would not demand the withdrawal of American troops as a prerequisite for discussing the North\u2019s nuclear program, some supporters of Mr. Moon\u2019s liberal administration have long wanted the United States to reduce or withdraw its presence in the South, where about 28,500 American troops are stationed. Such a move would alarm Japan, which benefits from United States military protection in the region.\n\nAnalysts in Japan also worry that South Korea, in an effort to unify the peninsula, could start to pull away from the United States and be drawn further toward China, a North Korean ally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf South Korea becomes a Chinese ally in the most extreme scenario, how can we defend ourselves?\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWe would be put in a very, very difficult position,\u201d Mr. Michishita said. \u201cIf the Korean Peninsula gets inside the Chinese sphere of influence and there are no U.S. forces on the peninsula, life for the U.S. and Japan would be very difficult, but especially for Japan.\u201d\n\nHoping to have some say in the course of events, Japan has been seeking to set up its own summit meeting between Mr. Abe and Mr. Kim. So far, the North has not responded.\n\nAnalysts said that Japan may get its moment if the North indeed comes out of isolation, and starts looking for financial support to fulfill Mr. Kim\u2019s promise of building the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIf North Korea is serious about having a totally different life from now on, they need some financial help from someone and it must be, in the end, Japan,\u201d said Mr. Kubo, the University of Tokyo professor.\n\nJapan, which until its defeat in World War II ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony, paid reparations to South Korea in 1965 but has yet to pay any to the North, Mr. Kubo noted. \u201cSo then, logically, they should be interested in talking with Japan in the end.\u201d", "title": "Japan Worries It\u2019ll Be Forgotten as Its Allies Talk to North Korea", "authors": ["Motoko Rich"]}

The National High School Baseball Tournament is preparing for its centennial celebration later this year, and the Tokyo Organizing Committee got baseball reinstated as a medal sport for the 2020 Olympics.\n\nOhtani confounded American expectations by coming to Major League Baseball at 23, instead of waiting for a bigger payday in two years, when his salary would not have been constrained by the league\u2019s international signing rules for players under 25. Already with five years of pro experience in Japan, he is seven years younger than the average age of the 56 Japanese players to debut in M.L.B. before him.\n\nWith wins in his first two pitching starts and three home runs in his first four games as designated hitter, Ohtani is quickly quieting those who doubted that anyone other than Babe Ruth could thrive playing both ways. His next impact may be inspiring players with an interest in Major League Baseball to consider going at a younger age.\n\nBut the pipeline from Japan has noticeably slowed down. The streak of at least one new Japanese player debuting in North America\u2019s top league every year since Hideo Nomo with the Dodgers in 1995 ended last season at 22. A new one has already begun this year with the Padres\u2019 Kazuhisa Makita and the Diamondbacks\u2019 Yoshihisa Hirano joining Ohtani in M.L.B.\n\nBut pitching has long been Japan\u2019s forte. No position player from Japan has debuted in M.L.B. since 2013, far and away the longest drought since Ichiro Suzuki first played in Seattle in 2001.\n\nSetting aside Ohtani\u2019s two-way aspirations \u2014 he has been used as a designated hitter this season but not in the field \u2014 Suzuki, now 44 and back in Seattle, is the lone position player from Japan in the big leagues.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cKazuo Matsui was the best middle infielder of his time,\u201d said Aki Inose, a longtime baseball commentator in Japan. \u201cI think Japanese people were shocked when his game didn\u2019t translate, and that had a big impact on other position players\u2019 thoughts about trying to make the jump to America.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMets fans remember Matsui all too well. Considered the answer at shortstop when he signed in 2004, the Mets shifted Jose Reyes to second base. Unable to fulfill his potential, Matsui was traded to the Colorado Rockies during his third season.\n\nHe performed his best after the trade, batting near .300 with an on-base percentage of .350 in 2007 and \u201908. Matsui played seven M.L.B. seasons, the fourth-longest stint for a Japanese position player behind Suzuki, Hideki Matsui and So Taguchi. Matsui returned to Japan in 2011 and at 42 is a player-coach for his original team, the Seibu Lions.\n\nM.L.B.\u2019s reliance on power, a longtime shortcoming in Japan, helps explain why more position players have not come, but Heid said Japanese infielders, in particular, were at a disadvantage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Munenori Kawasaki signed with Seattle in 2012. At 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds, he had a typical Japanese physique, and he was popular for his determination and positive spirit. Despite just one career home run, he persevered, willing himself into lineups for five consecutive seasons, playing games for the Mariners, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Chicago Cubs.\n\nKawasaki had more at-bats in Class AAA than in the majors, but he was intent on staying in North America. He was doing this in his mid-30s as he was starting a family. Few players who have achieved stardom are willing to toil in the minors at that stage of their careers and lives.\n\n\u201cAs Japanese, we take pride in the strong fundamentals we are taught growing up,\u201d said Kawasaki, who returned to Japan\u2019s Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks last year and announced his retirement a few weeks ago. \u201cBut the flip side is we are not encouraged to make backhanded plays, jumping throws off balance, et cetera. In the minors I watched guys do it and practiced every day. When I finally made an out from shortstop on a running, backhanded stop where I twisted my body in midair and threw underhanded all the way to first, it was the happiest moment for me. Who cares if it was the minor leagues?

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nI first read \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d as a teenager; I imagine this is when most Americans encounter F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s seminal work. Our teachers, rightly so, hail the novel as a masterpiece, so we read it under their influence, when we are young. We read it when we are bewildered and delighted at our changing bodies, flush with burgeoning sexuality, heady with the certainty of our ascendancy, the prospect of our future greatness shining off in the distance like a great green star.\n\nIt is easy for young people to see themselves in Gatsby. His earnestness is familiar. His ambition, twinned with desperation, resonates with any teenager who wants to journey off to college or move states away for work, in a bid to escape youthful boundaries. Poverty made Gatsby ravenously desperate for difference, for possibility. Some, perhaps from similar circumstances, will recognize that and see themselves. Others will empathize because they feel driven away by parents who don\u2019t understand them, by peers who underestimate or limit them, by the larger culture that ostracizes them for one reason or another. Their hearts will be, as Gatsby\u2019s was, \u201cin a constant, turbulent riot.\u201d The \u201cinstinct toward \u2026 future glory\u201d leads them out into the world. They burn to flee, to grow beyond their birth circumstances. In some ways, adolescence is one great flight.\n\nTeenage readers are especially understanding of Gatsby\u2019s fixation on recreating that moment when his life was most open to possibility, when he could become and do anything. When he believed that if he worked hard enough, he could remake himself. He could ascend to a different social class, a class where life seemed to be an enchanted necklace, each moment a pearl on an endless string. It seems to be a universal sentiment of youth: the belief that, given the luxury of time and focus, one can become anything. Young readers walk down tree-lined Louisville streets with Gatsby and Daisy as the leaves fall. They see a ladder \u201cmounted to a secret place above the trees. \u2026 Once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\u201d The young know that golden moment when anything can happen, and they understand its allure because they are living it.\n\nBy the end of the book, the reader\u2019s empathy has burned to love. Young readers fall for Gatsby\u2019s passion, his insistence that life should be relished, should be executed well. They have fallen in love with the persistence of his devotion to Daisy. I imagine they like to think they are capable of such a great love, one that smolders, lasting from year to year. They adore him so much, they feel a quiet disdain for those who do not possess his virtues: perhaps most of all for Tom, who embodies the worst excesses of the moneyed elite, the misogynistic, the racist. They pity Nick, too, because they understand he has fallen in love with Gatsby; readers understand that Nick doesn\u2019t deserve Gatsby. Even though he insists he is not carelessly violent like Tom or Daisy, the young understand that Nick is as much a product of his social class as Tom, that its backwardness and insularity mark him as much as they do Tom and Daisy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the experience I had while reading \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d as an adult was very different. I would argue that this reading was deeper, more emphatically felt. While most young people admire Gatsby\u2019s youthful love for Daisy \u2014 for the possibility associated with her economic and social class, and for who he was with Daisy, too, in that shining moment in time \u2014 there is much subtext that becomes clearer with age, subtext Fitzgerald must have been acutely aware of when he wrote \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne of the first great lessons of my adulthood was this: I change. As I grow, my dreams change, as do my ideas about who I can be and what I want during the short time I am alive. Gatsby has not learned this. It is a lesson he has closed himself to. From the moment he meets Daisy, his ideas about who he is and what he wants and what he can become are immutable. It\u2019s ironic that he is so in love with the moment of greatest possibility in his youth, the moment he kissed Daisy, but his love for that moment has rendered all other avenues of possibility impossible, has fossilized him, sealed him in amber, turned him to stone \u2014 made it possible for him to see only one version of himself. After years of underhanded dealing and shady business, he is wealthy, popular, feared, respected. On West Egg, he hosts glittering parties where old money and new money engage in raucous revelry together. He owns the newest, most exquisite cars and he has mannerisms and a wardrobe to match his new social station. When we meet Gatsby, he has worked furiously to make himself into the man who, on the surface, high society would have deemed a good match for Daisy. And in the end, this immutability, this blindness to change, the fact that Gatsby can picture himself as only one thing, limits him.", "title": "Jay Gatsby: A Dreamer Doomed to Be Excluded.

After teaching high school in Arlington, Mass., and serving as assistant director of Harvard\u2019s Upward Bound program, she moved to New York City in 1967 to work on early childhood development projects for the General Learning Corporation. In New York she also met a sculptor, Claudio Marzollo; they married in 1969.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe and some friends formed a company to write educational material for and about children, including a parent/teacher guide to \u201cSesame Street,\u201d which had premiered on public television in 1969.\n\nThat led Ms. Marzollo into book writing, first for grown-ups. \u201cLearn Through Play\u201d was published in 1972, and she would write others for adults, like \u201cFathers & Babies\u201d (1993), a baby-care book for dads, and \u201cYour Maternity Leave\u201d (1989), which carried the forthright subtitle \u201cHow to Leave Work, Have a Baby, and Go Back to Work Without Getting Lost, Trapped or Sandbagged Along the Way.\u201d\n\nBut children\u2019s books were her main interest. In 1972 she became editor of \u201cLet\u2019s Find Out,\u201d a monthly magazine for kindergartners, and 1978 brought her first children\u2019s book, \u201cClose Your Eyes\u201d (illustrated by Susan Jeffers), about a boy having trouble falling asleep.\n\nOf the many that followed, one of her favorites was \u201cPierre the Penguin: A True Story\u201d (2010, illustrated by Laura Regan). It is about a penguin at a California zoo whose caretaker makes the animal a wet suit because it is missing feathers.\n\n\u201cUsing a cute (and catchy) rhyme, author Marzollo tells the true story of a bedraggled penguin and the human caretaker who hits upon the perfect solution to his problem,\u201d wrote Terri Schlichenmeyer, author of the Bookworm Sez syndicated review column. She added that children \u201cwho have a problem with teasing will be able to identify with Pierre.\u201d\n\nAnother that Ms. Marzollo was particularly pleased with, her family said, was \u201cHappy Birthday, Martin Luther King\u201d (1993, illustrated by J. Brian Pinkney). In it she recognized the sensitivity of writing for a young audience. When dealing with King\u2019s death, the text is sparse but straightforward.\n\n\u201cMartin Luther King Jr. was shot and killed in 1968,\u201d it says. However, in the book\u2019s foreword, she advises those reading it to preschoolers to use their judgment.\n\n\u201cIf you feel that the words \u2018shot and killed\u2019 on page 30 are inappropriate for the child or children you plan to read this book to, you may want to change the words and say simply that Martin Luther King \u2018died\u2019 in 1968,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt isn\u2019t, after all, necessary for us to tell very young children the harsh details about Reverend King\u2019s death in order to convey to them the central message of his inspirational leadership.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut softening reality for young readers had its limits for her. In 1993, she and another children\u2019s author, Kate McMullan, were invited to speak at Sag Harbor Elementary School on Long Island for an \u201cauthor\u2019s day.\u201d But the ostensibly harmless event caused a local uproar when school officials objected to two small illustrations in Ms. McMullan\u2019s book \u201cThe Noisy Giants\u2019 Tea Party,\u201d one of a boy running away after breaking a window with a basketball, the other of three men staggering out of a tavern.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen a school official explained that the intent of the event (which was eventually canceled) was not to prompt a discussion of social issues and values, Ms. Marzollo took umbrage.\n\n\u201cAll literature is about values,\u201d she told The New York Times. \u201cI can\u2019t name a picture book that is not about values. That\u2019s why people read. Kindergarten teachers impose values on children all day long. They say, \u2018Let\u2019s clean up.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s not hit each other.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s not run in the hall.\u2019 If something in a book triggers a discussion, that\u2019s a teachable moment.\u201d\n\nThere was no controversy surrounding Ms. Marzollo\u2019s \u201cI Spy\u201d books, just a demand for more of them. The eight original \u201cI Spy\u201d books led to spinoffs like an \u201cI Spy Challenger\u201d series, with extra-hard puzzles.

Over the years they included Kermit the Frog, Snoopy, Spider-Man, Betty Boop and later Cassie the Dragoness, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Tom Turkey and Blue, the star of Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues.\u201d\n\nThe biggest of the marvelous monsters were held down and guided by ropes and strong men trained in what Ms. McFaddin called \u201cballoonology.\u201d Still, many of the characters were obstreperous.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re 60 feet tall and 30 feet wide, you go where you like, or try to, despite the 50 people hanging on to your 35 guidelines,\u201d The New York Times reported her saying in 1995.\n\nMs. McFaddin oversaw everything: financing, sponsors and broadcast rights; decisions on who, what and how many would join the parade (some years she auditioned 300 bands); construction of balloons and floats in a warehouse in Hoboken, N.J.; the transporting of everything before dawn into Manhattan; liaison with police, fire and safety units; promotion and publicity; and on and on. It took months.\n\n\u201cThe world was Jean\u2019s stage,\u201d said William Schermerhorn, Macy\u2019s creative director for special events, who worked with her for 17 years. \u201cComing from a background in street theater, she could transform a parking lot, a department-store marquee, a park lawn or 34th Street into a wondrous showcase. Above all, I remember the heart, joy and scale she brought to Macy\u2019s events. She shaped the events into what they are today.\u201d\n\nWith the wisdom of experience, she urged parents to dress children in layers of bright clothing and to pin name tags (with phone numbers) on them, just in case.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBring garbage bags,\u201d she advised. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to carry. You can sit on them or use them as windbreakers and then use them to collect any trash you left on the street after the parade. They are the ultimate in Thanksgiving Day wear.\u201d\n\nBy 6 a.m. every Thanksgiving Day, the balloons were inflated, the floats were lined up and 3,000 volunteer cheerleaders were ready. At 9 a.m., Ms. McFaddin, usually dressed in Macy\u2019s colors \u2014 a red coat, black slacks and a black cowboy hat \u2014 made her way to 77th Street and Central Park West, cut a red ribbon and stepped off, leading the parade on its proud two-and-a-half-mile march to Herald Square.\n\nAl Roker, who covered the parade for NBC for years, recalled Ms. McFaddin as an outsize personality with a deep Texas drawl.\n\n\u201cAs marchers, balloon handlers, clowns and myriad parade workers got ready,\u201d Mr. Roker said in an email, \u201cshe would be weaving in and out among them with a look of pleasant professionalism, and then she\u2019d spot me, break out into a grin and greet me with, \u2018Al, darlin\u2019, we are gonna have us a beautiful parade!\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. McFaddin and her entourage braved bitter cold, drenching rains and, once, a snowstorm that drove crowds away. Gusting winds often blew down balloons, sometimes injuring spectators. In 1997, the Cat in the Hat struck a lamppost, parts of which hit a woman, who suffered a serious head injury. After that, balloon sizes were limited and restrictions were imposed in high winds.\n\nThere were other mishaps. Ms. McFaddin once grabbed the trailing rope of a runaway balloon and was briefly carried aloft. Another year, as TV cameras caught the action for a national audience, a little girl trying to catch Santa accidentally pulled his pants down. (To everyone\u2019s relief, he wore jeans underneath.)\n\nBut the sun was bright and there were no calamities at Ms. McFaddin\u2019s last parade, in 2000. To celebrate her 24th anniversary as its organizer-director, the City of New York renamed Macy\u2019s corner, 34th Street and Broadway, \u201cJean McFaddin Way\u201d for a month.\n\nOn her watch, the parade had doubled in size to 8,000 marchers, balloons had jumped tenfold to 85 and spectators had swelled into the millions. Ms. McFaddin shared more than a dozen Emmy Awards with NBC for the parade telecasts, and in 1999 she was inducted into the International Festivals and Events Association Hall of Fame, the industry\u2019s most prestigious honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a night\u2019s rest, she began her next project \u2014 Santaland. From the day after Thanksgiving until Christmas Eve, 300,000 children and parents visited Macy\u2019s eighth-floor setting for the rites of seeing Santa. They received tickets for the North Pole Express, saw an enchanted forest, chatted with elves who told stories of Santa\u2019s workshop, and finally met St. Nick.\n\n\u201cIt was about keeping the magic and miracle of Christmas alive for the thousands of children who came to believe that this was the true Santa,\u201d Mr. Krauss said.\n\nA few months later, Ms. McFaddin\u2019s indoor flower show at Macy\u2019s \u2014 filling the main floor with lilac bushes, azaleas, rhododendrons, tulips, amaryllis, primrose and begonias \u2014 unfolded in the first flush of spring. It was an enormous hit every year.\n\n\u201cMove over Central Park, the Macy\u2019s Flower Show is back in town,\u201d Herbert Muschamp wrote in a review for The Times in April 1996. \u201cFor two weeks each year, the world\u2019s biggest store is home to New York\u2019s most fantastic park: a colorful hybrid of commerce and nature in full and fragrant bloom. For those too old for Santa, the Flower Show is the true miracle on 34th Street.\u201d\n\nJean Eleanor McFaddin was born in Lufkin, Tex., on July 13, 1942, the second of three children of Ora Lance McFaddin, a real estate developer, and the former Eleanor Clark. Jean and her siblings, Janet and Lance, attended Lufkin High School, from which Jean graduated in 1960.\n\nIntending a career in theater, she received an associate arts degree at Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., in 1962 and, at the University of Texas at Austin, earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1964 and a master\u2019s in theater production in 1966.\n\nShe acted in companies in Oklahoma and California, and in Los Angeles directed the Liquid Theater, whose cast interacted with audiences in unplanned talking and touching. It ran in New York, London and Paris. \u201cIt embraced you,\u201d Ms. McFaddin recalled. \u201cIt asked strangers to be friends and to trust one another.\u201d\n\nShe produced \u201cCoucou Bazaar\u201d in New York with the French artist Jean Dubuffet. It caught audiences in psychedelic swirls of pictures flashing on walls and Kabuki-like dancers. She directed a 1975-76 Bicentennial program for the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington and oversaw New York City\u2019s Fourth of July Land Festival in 1977. That drew the attention of Macy\u2019s, a festival sponsor, and she was hired to revive the store\u2019s faded parade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. McFaddin was soon inspiring all of Macy\u2019s holiday celebrations. She rose to senior vice president of public relations and events for Macy\u2019s East, comprising scores of stores. Events included \u201cTap-O-Mania,\u201d a summer gathering of thousands of tap dancers performing on 34th Street.\n\nHer Macy\u2019s fireworks display every Fourth of July dazzled millions. Launched from barges in the Hudson River or New York Harbor after dark, it was the city\u2019s biggest pyrotechnic display of the year \u2014 a booming, scintillating barrage of rockets and starbursts that bathed the awed crowds in eerie light and echoed off the facades of a city that lived on imagination.\n\nIn 2010, she and her companion of 37 years, Susan Falk, were married at their home in Ridgefield, Conn. Besides Ms. Falk, she is survived by her brother, Lance, four nieces and two nephews.\n\nVideo\n\nIn her later years, Ms. McFaddin continued to produce events for corporations, civic groups and charities like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nBut she had officially retired in April 2001, a few weeks after her last flower show. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, at a City Hall news conference, proclaimed \u201cJean McFaddin Day in the City of New York.\u201d\n\nAnd she received a handwritten note from Maureen O\u2019Hara. \u201cYour wonderful contributions to Macy\u2019s, to New York City and to womanhood will never be forgotten,\u201d it said, and signed off, \u201cfrom one Parade Lady to another.\u201d", "title": "Jean McFaddin, Who Made the Macy\u2019s Parade What It Is, Dies at 75", "authors": ["Robert D.

In a statement, WFAN said that no decisions have been made regarding time slots or programming, and that negotiations with Mr. Francesa are still in process.\n\n\u201cEvery day they walk in here they\u2019re going to feel like, \u2018Wow, everybody looks at us like a failure,\u2019 and that\u2019s just the perception of what it\u2019s going to be, and that\u2019s not fair,\u201d Mr. Giannotti said during Wednesday\u2019s broadcast.

In 2008, Mr. Francesa split from his longtime co-host Chris Russo, known as Mad Dog, breaking up a 19-year partnership over contract issues and interpersonal strife that played out over the airwaves. A representative for Mr. Russo, who now hosts Mad Dog Sports Radio on Sirius XM, said he was unavailable to respond because he was on the air.\n\nMr. Francesa did not respond to messages left at his home phone requesting comment. Mike Levine, an agent with Creative Artists Agency, which is representing Mr. Francesa, declined to comment.\n\nIn an interview with Newsday on April 24, Mr. Francesa seemed to suggest that the resistance to his return to the air is what spurred him to come back. \u201cThis is for those who started this campaign in recent days,\u201d Mr. Francesa told Newsday. \u201cI didn\u2019t decide to go back to WFAN until I was told I better not go back.\u201d", "title": "Jeering, at Least From the Press Box, as Mike Francesa Returns", "authors": ["Sarah Maslin Nir"]}

When he is in Washington, Mr. Sessions has a turkey sandwich from the Justice Department cafeteria (base price: $5.29) for lunch, which he eats at his desk. When his team works late, he hands out granola bars, which his wife buys in bulk at Costco.\n\nWhen meeting with the police, border patrol officers and the victims of crime, Mr. Sessions gives Mr. Trump all of the credit for a law-and-order crackdown he has put into effect with a speed that thrills supporters and appalls critics. With Mr. Trump, he has said, Americans are getting \u201csupport for law enforcement like we haven\u2019t seen in many years.\u201d He leaves out the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s support does not extend to him.\n\nA Republican former senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions was an early, fervent backer of Mr. Trump. But as attorney general, Mr. Sessions said it was his legal duty to protect the Russia investigation, even if his boss would prefer that Mr. Sessions protect him. The president\u2019s firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was in charge of the Russia investigation, led to Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s appointment as special counsel. But Mr. Trump blames Mr. Sessions.\n\nMr. Sessions\u2019s staff declined to make him available for an interview for this article.\n\nMr. Sessions laid out his philosophy for the sheriffs: \u201cThe United States of America is not an idea \u2014 it\u2019s a nation-state. We have a Constitution, we have laws, we have borders,\u201d and it is his job to help protect them.\n\nMr. Sessions has lost no time. As the opioid crisis continues to spread, he has reversed the Obama Justice Department\u2019s \u201csmart on crime\u201d initiative that encouraged prosecutors to seek lighter penalties for nonviolent drug offenders. Instead, Mr. Sessions has instructed prosecutors to seek the harshest possible sentences. He opposes criminal justice overhaul efforts championed by Jared Kushner, the Koch brothers and Republican former colleagues, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who has defended Mr. Sessions against Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks.

That drew him into conflict with Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2014. Mr. Gardner blocked confirmation votes for some 20 Justice Department appointees for months, backing down only after a phone call from Mr. Trump this month, assuring him that Colorado\u2019s marijuana industry would not be targeted.\n\nIt was Mr. Sessions who announced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama executive order shielding from deportation immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He is suing the state of California over its sanctuary laws: \u201cIt cannot be, as it seems to be today, that someone who illegally crosses the border here on a Monday and ends up in San Francisco on Wednesday can never be deported,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in Las Cruces. \u201cEven if they were hauling dope to San Francisco and they got arrested, they can\u2019t be deported. Now, how illogical and insane, really, is that?\u201d\n\nUnaccompanied children from Central America are flooding across the border, he warned, exploiting loopholes in the law so that they \u201care not able to be returned quickly,\u201d Mr. Sessions said, citing arrests of juveniles accused of smuggling drugs. \u201cI have ordered each United States attorney\u2019s office along the southwest border to have a zero-tolerance policy toward illegal entry. Our goal is to prosecute every case that is brought to us. There must be consequences for illegal actions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTodd A. Cox, director of policy at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., said Mr. Sessions was ably carrying out Mr. Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cHe\u2019s put in place policies that will return us to the discredited war on drugs, which had catastrophic impacts on communities of color,\u201d Mr. Cox said in an interview. \u201cHe is doing precisely what this administration has pledged to do.\u201d\n\nSome Justice employees, however, see Mr. Sessions\u2019s stoicism as capitulation. In a survey last year of employee morale conducted by the United States Office of Personnel Management and compiled by the Partnership for Public Service, the Justice Department was ranked 11th among 18 large agencies, down from sixth in 2016. Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who supervises Mr. Mueller, is also fighting for his job, pressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional allies to produce hundreds of thousands of documents related to politically delicate F.B.I. investigations.\n\nIn Las Cruces, Mr. Sessions ended his speech to the sheriffs with a favored line: \u201cWe have your back. You have our thanks.\u201d\n\nThere is no such comfort for Mr. Sessions. Congress cannot stop Mr. Trump from firing him, though Republican leaders have warned that Mr. Trump would pay a heavy political price if he does. Potential replacements for Mr. Sessions are, in the meantime, circling, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, who joined Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team last week.\n\nMr. Sessions\u2019s allies say he is not distracted.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "The Russian-born Balanchine, heterosexual and subtly aristocratic, embodied \u2014 and extended \u2014 the classical orthodoxy of ballet. He effortlessly created stage hierarchies; specialized in effects of grandeur, scale and formality; and glorified women. Robbins, born in New York in a Jewish immigrant family and raised in New Jersey, embodied many aspects of the traditional American story: He discovered high culture through education and never lost his connection with ornery behavior after he became famous. (One source of torment had been the trauma of acknowledging his homosexuality.)\n\nRobbins had begun as a brilliant outsider, often with a superlative flair for caricaturing character and situation. \u201cFancy Free\u201d (1944) and \u201cThe Concert\u201d (1956) are masterpieces of this Robbins style. (A YouTube clip of the \u201cMistake Waltz\u201d sometimes makes the rounds without labeling to explain that it comes from \u201cThe Concert.\u201d Non-dance people, finding it hilarious and assuming it\u2019s a TV comedy sketch, are often amazed to find it was formally choreographed for the stage.)\n\nRobbins matured. Yet he had already made a breakthrough with his \u201cAfternoon of a Faun.\u201d This classic pas de deux isn\u2019t about a mythological faun\u2019s pursuit of nymphs, as Nijinsky\u2019s 1912 \u201cL\u2019Apr\u00e8s-Midi d\u2019un Faune\u201d had been \u2014 and yet Robbins is recreating aspects of that ballet\u2019s story, sometimes to the same moments in Debussy\u2019s music. The difference is that Robbins sets it in a ballet studio. A male dancer, after stretching on the studio floor, goes to sleep. A woman enters, dances with him, feels his sexual attraction to her and withdraws. Remembering the kiss he planted on her cheek, he returns to sleep. The whole thing might well be the man\u2019s dream.\n\nI especially love the way one phrase develops in \u201cFaun.\u201d The man places his arms and hands around the woman\u2019s face like a frame \u2014 but she then stretches through that frame into the air beyond. Following her thought, he lifts her, horizontally before his chest, and carries her across the stage while she continues to reach ahead. Suddenly, on a quiet \u201cping\u201d in the Debussy music, she does a subtle contraction in the air: She breaks the line of her arms and one knee (bending them) and turns her gaze down.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis has often seemed to me quintessentially Robbins. Like some of his wonderful images of involuntary jazz-style impulsiveness in \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d it occurs like a spasm and, in its break from formality, shows his sympathy for the young.\n\nGuess what? Last year, I found that this moment was actually choreographed by Balanchine. And Robbins, even 30 years later, loved to tell his dancers that this moment came from Balanchine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany dancers have recalled how Robbins, in \u201cFaun\u201d and other ballets, was a coach of genius, awakening their imagination and sense of motivation; he would spend days guiding a dancer through his or her own conception of a role. More than most choreographers, he was prepared to change or omit certain choreographed details \u2014 if they seemed not to suit the vision of the dancer in question.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A loosely structured ensemble, full of human intimacy, it\u2019s framed by two \u201cmemory\u201d solos (one at the start, for a man, and another halfway through, for a woman). Robbins, as with \u201cFiddler on the Roof,\u201d was revisiting in art an Eastern European society he had seen as a child on a visit to family there. Decades later, when touring Europe, he went to revisit the Jewish village he had known, only to find it had been wiped out.\n\nRobbins, often inspired by Balanchine, sometimes remarked that he felt like a beginner beside Balanchine\u2019s prodigious example. Yet influence went two ways: You can see traces of \u201cDances at a Gathering\u201d in Balanchine choreography. In both \u201cDuo Concertant\u201d (1972) and \u201cSonatine\u201d (1975), a Balanchine male-female couple moves with the pronounced informality and spontaneity of Robbins dancers; and in one of Balanchine\u2019s last ballets, \u201cRobert Schumann\u2019s \u2018Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze,\u2019 \u201d the eight dancers \u2014 almost never focused out front (as Balanchine dancers usually are) \u2014 make a community that is more Robbins than Balanchine.\n\nSoon after Balanchine\u2019s death, Robbins made \u201cGlass Pieces.\u201d City Ballet\u2019s first work to Minimalist music (Philip Glass), it has stood the test of time: Robbins leads his audience into the layerings and structures of three of the composer\u2019s works, with some of his most haunting theatrical imagery. The second movement is dazzling in the tiny steps and patterns given to a corps de ballet who closely cross the back of the stage. You could spend hours analyzing what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s easy to take your eyes off the lead couple in the foreground, b ut do watch them: For in the way the man bears the ballerina across the stage, at chest-height, Robbins is referring to the second movement of Balanchine\u2019s \u201cSymphony in C.\u201d It\u2019s his homage to the classic that changed his career 35 years before.", "title": "Jerome Robbins, Ballet\u2019s Mr. \u2018Take It Easy, Baby,\u2019 at 100", "authors": ["Alastair Macaulay"]}

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a radical, ecumenical, antiwar, pro-immigrant and scholarly champion of the poor. Readers shared their own reminiscences about Dr. King and their thoughts on the changes in the country since his assassination 50 years ago. Here are some of their comments and Mr. Jackson\u2019s responses. \u2014 The Editors\n\nThank you for sharing your witness to these powerful events. Before the recent Alabama election, the secretary of state attempted to move tens of thousands of voters onto inactive rolls. Fortunately, lawsuits brought by the N.A.A.C.P. and tireless efforts of black women to get out the vote denied the state\u2019s Republicans another stolen election. In the 21st century, the need for vigilance is as keen as ever and there is still much work to do. \u2014 Ann, California\n\nJesse Jackson: With the changing demographics in the country there is a concerted effort by Republicans to make it harder for people of color, women, workers, students, young people, seniors and the disabled to vote. This is mostly a result of our states-rights and local-control voting systems. It will probably surprise you, but the explicit individual right to vote is not in the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court\u2019s Heller ruling in 2008 gave individuals the right to own a gun, but we still don\u2019t have a right to vote. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting to add a right-to-vote amendment to the Constitution. Congress would then be obligated to pass voting laws with minimum common-sense national standards.\n\nKing was not a statue. He was a man of flesh and blood. A man who had fears and hopes. A man who had failures and successes. A man whose wife and kids sacrificed their family time for his struggle for racial justice. To make more of him is to diminish his achievement and give us an excuse for not doing a thing because we have no leader of his stature.", "title": "Opinion | Jesse Jackson on Race Relations, Trump and the Right to Vote", "authors": []}

And of those eight quarterbacks, only Jameis Winston of Tampa Bay (2015) and Mitch Trubisky, who as a rookie started Chicago\u2019s final 12 games last season, have failed to guide the team that drafted them to the playoffs.\n\nThe clearest path to perennial contending doubles as the best value in the league: a great quarterback on a rookie contract, with its slotted salary and modest cap charge. The financial flexibility allows teams to allocate the saved money toward fortifying their rosters. It\u2019s how the Philadelphia Eagles, with Carson Wentz, the No. 2 pick in 2016, assembled a Super Bowl champion roster, and how the Los Angeles Rams, with Jared Goff, the No. 1 pick in 2016, are trying to overtake them.\n\nIt\u2019s also how the Jets intend to return to prominence. Even after this off-season\u2019s free-agent splurge, which included cornerback Trumaine Johnson and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, the Jets could have more than $100 million in cap space for 2019, according to overthecap.com, that they can spend to aid their new quarterback.\n\nThe potential pitfall, for Maccagnan and Gettleman, is that while this year\u2019s quarterback class is loaded with potential, there is no consensus favorite, no certain future star \u2014 no one quite like Wentz or Andrew Luck, whom the NFL Network draft guru Mike Mayock in a recent conference call called his two easiest quarterback evaluations over the last decade. It\u2019s conceivable that the first quarterback chosen will be the top quarterback on his team\u2019s board and fourth \u2014 or lower \u2014 on others\u2019.\n\nGettleman called the notion of feeling obligated to take a quarterback \u201chogwash,\u201d and yet he may not get a better chance to draft Manning\u2019s eventual replacement. He must evaluate how close the Giants are to contending this season, whether the team is talented enough to help a player like Barkley emulate Ezekiel Elliott of Dallas and Leonard Fournette of Jacksonville, two running backs who went fourth and thrived as rookies.\n\nThe mystery will end Thursday night, when the Giants and the Jets choose players, most likely one right after the other, who will share a media market, a stadium and, perhaps, a position. And if the Giants do not take a quarterback before the Jets do, the longtime personnel executive Phil Savage said, they must be convinced that their choice will be an exceptional player.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Savage, now the executive director of the Senior Bowl and a SiriusXM analyst, in a telephone interview, \u201cthat\u2019s going to be the comparison for at least a decade.\u201d", "title": "Jets and Giants Share Something Else: High Stakes at the Draft", "authors": []}

There\u2019s a limit, also, to trying to cure bigotry with earnest appeals to tolerance. The German government is mulling a proposal to require recent arrivals in the country to tour Nazi concentration camps as a way of engendering a feeling of empathy for Jews. It doesn\u2019t seem to occur to anyone that, to the virulent anti-Semite, Buchenwald is a source of inspiration, not shame.\n\nAll this comes to mind as Israel this week marks (in the Hebrew calendar) the 70th anniversary of its independence. There are many reasons to celebrate the date, many of them lofty: a renaissance for Jewish civilization; the creation of a feisty liberal democracy in a despotic neighborhood; the ecological rescue of a once-barren land; the end of 1,878 years of exile.\n\nBut there\u2019s a more basic reason. Jews cannot rely for their safety on the kindness of strangers, least of all French or German politicians. Theodor Herzl saw this with the Dreyfus Affair and founded modern Zionism. Post-Hitler Europe still has far to fall when it comes to its attitudes toward Jews, but the trend is clear. The question is the pace.\n\nHence Israel: its army, bomb, and robust willingness to use force to defend itself. Israel did not come into existence to serve as another showcase of the victimization of Jews. It exists to end the victimization of Jews.\n\nThat\u2019s a point that Israel\u2019s restless critics could stand to learn. On Friday, Palestinians in Gaza returned for the fourth time to the border fence with Israel, in protests promoted by Hamas. The explicit purpose of Hamas leaders is to breach the fence and march on Jerusalem.

Three new books explore the influence of the Jews and other immigrants on the city, from Jewish refugees first arriving here in the 17th century, to the 20th-century arrival of the Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, which substantially changed the demographics of the city going into the new millennium.\n\nIn \u201cJewish New York: The Remarkable Story of a City and a People\u201d (New York University Press), Deborah Dash Moore, Jeffrey S. Gurock, Annie Polland, Howard B.

The best-selling thriller writer Jo Nesbo is the latest to give it a try, in \u201cMacbeth,\u201d reviewed for us by James Shapiro, a Shakespeare scholar and the author of several acclaimed books about the Bard.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think Nesbo is the greatest contemporary writer of the thriller, and he understands that Macbeth is the great grandaddy of the thriller, the murder mystery,\u201d Mr. Shapiro says on this week\u2019s podcast. \u201cHe gets that as well as any writer can.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Shapiro says, there is \u201calways a price to pay when you are turning a Shakespeare play into something else.\u201d He discusses what he considers the many strengths of Mr. Nesbo\u2019s novel along with that price to pay.\n\nLeila Slimani joins us this week to discuss her novel \u201cThe Perfect Nanny,\u201d which won the Prix Goncourt award in France.

I think that literature is here to ask questions, not to answer questions. A novel is not a trial.

{"date": "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s tougher than it looks to create a world that is faithful to Shakespeare\u2019s original while also feeling modern and real. Placing Shakespeare\u2019s story in a late-20th-century world of drugs, gangs and corrupt civic leaders goes a long way toward solving this problem. \u201cBrew\u201d \u2014 the term used for the drug to which so many are addicted \u2014 is at the heart of Nesbo\u2019s novel and neatly straddles the murky world of Shakespeare\u2019s witches, with their caldron, and that of modern drug labs. By making addiction so central to his plot, Nesbo also makes Macbeth\u2019s paranoia and hallucinatory visions, so crucial to Shakespeare\u2019s play, not just believable but meaningful in a contemporary way.\n\nGang warfare also informs Nesbo\u2019s retelling and is well suited to the extreme violence of Shakespeare\u2019s original, in which the fighting that is described and staged is ferocious. In this dangerous world of ever-shifting loyalties and ill-gotten gains, it\u2019s easy to become morally compromised. Such is the fate of Nesbo\u2019s Macbeth, who at the outset is a good cop, but soon enough hungers for promotion and power \u2014 which prove more addictive than the drugs and alcohol that trap so many in the world of this novel.\n\nIn \u201cMacbeth,\u201d Shakespeare was unusually stingy when it came to sharing his characters\u2019 back stories and motivations. Did Lady Macbeth have a child that died? Was the idea of killing Duncan planted in Macbeth\u2019s mind by the witches or by Lady Macbeth, or had it been there, dormant, all along? Why does Macduff abandon his family? What Shakespeare withholds, Nesbo delves into deeply, taking one of Shakespeare\u2019s shortest and most enigmatic plays and expanding on what brought his characters to this point in their lives.\n\nImage\n\nSo, for example, we think of Macbeth a lot differently once we imagine that he spent part of his childhood in an orphanage. And Duff (Macduff) becomes more sympathetic when we see him torn between personal loyalties and the demands of the heart. The price paid by developing these intertwining back stories is that it takes Nesbo almost 450 pages to connect them, though the pace rarely lags. He is gifted at using casual details to define character: It makes perfect sense that Banquo drives an old Volvo, while Malcolm prefers a muscle car, a secondhand Chevelle.\n\nMinor characters like the demonic Seyton and Caithness (here a woman, and in love with Duff) have more significance and are brought to life. Surprisingly, although both Macbeth and his wife, Lady, are vividly drawn, Nesbo doesn\u2019t give the couple much of a history together \u2014 they\u2019ve only known each other for a few years \u2014 which may explain why their relationship feels far less intense and electric than it does in Shakespeare\u2019s original.", "title": "Jo Nesbo Sculpts \u2018Macbeth\u2019 Into Shadowy Crime Noir", "authors": []}

Sartorially, she\u2019d split the difference: black coat, flowered pants, turquoise eyeliner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe had a break from rehearsal \u2014 it was a week before previews began, stagehands were loading in the set \u2014 and she\u2019d taken a car to a traffic triangle on the Upper West Side. That\u2019s where the city\u2019s Parks Department plunked the Joan of Arc memorial, sculpted by Anna Vaughn Hyatt Huntington in 1915, five years before Joan was canonized, eight years before Shaw wrote his play.\n\nMs. Rashad led Penny, her bitty, swaggering cockapoo, around the statue, noticing Joan\u2019s feet straining against the stirrups, Joan\u2019s hand clutching the sword she never used, her eyes and face upturned toward her God. \u201cVery appropriate,\u201d Ms. Rashad said approvingly.\n\nThe daughter of the actress and director Phylicia Rashad and the sportscaster and former N.F.L. player Ahmad Rashad, she has the preternatural composure of a person who meditates daily, practices yoga weekly and has given up even occasional drinking in order to \u201cfeel clearer than I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d (And while I didn\u2019t think to ask about skin care, she definitely had that Maid of Orl\u00e9ans shimmer.)\n\nPhoto\n\nShe doesn\u2019t mind being practically the only woman in the rehearsal room, if that\u2019s what it takes to tell Joan\u2019s story, she said. (Her cast mates in the Manhattan Theater Club production include Adam Chanler-Berat, Patrick Page and Jack Davenport.) She doesn\u2019t mind being one of the few people who are not white. \u201cOf course I want there to be more people of color in the room, but there\u2019s also the thing of \u2018Well, I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s make the most of it,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nWhen her casting was announced, a few French ultranationalist Twitter users and some bullying Reddit posters accused her of cultural appropriation. She read a few of the comments and then she stopped. The abuse didn\u2019t make her mad. Actually, she mostly felt sorry for the complainers, she said. \u201cYou guys are missing out.\u201d\n\nIt is tempting to want to poke at Ms. Rashad\u2019s extraordinary poise, to wonder if it\u2019s innate or a necessary adaptation to a business and a culture that doesn\u2019t always applaud female truth-telling. Where does serenity stop and really solid media training begin?\n\nWell, a potential manager once told Ms. Rashad that she was too elegant to play prostitutes, which is an icky way of suggesting that she carries herself with a certain reserve. But she isn\u2019t cold, and she isn\u2019t snooty. I spoke to five directors who worked with her and they threw around nouns like maturity and intelligence and strength and dignity and humanity and authenticity and, in Mr. Sullivan\u2019s words, \u201ca wonderful simplicity.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The elder Ms. Rashad, speaking by telephone on a break from shooting \u201cCreed II,\u201d said that her daughter had always spoken her mind and that \u201cshe has always been given to kindness\u201d and to empathy. She told a childhood story of watching Condola standing in the driveway, waiting for a butterfly to alight on her fingers. The butterfly did.\n\nStill, the denial of Joan\u2019s anger nagged at me. Could Ms. Rashad be great in a great part if she refused to play the full range of it?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer Broadway roles have included a sweetie-pie Juliet in a muddled Shakespeare, a grief-struck daughter in \u201cStick Fly,\u201d a melancholy young bride in \u201cThe Trip to Bountiful.\u201d She has a strong affinity for good characters (with typical humility she disputes this: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m captain good guy\u201d), and she has the rare ability to make goodness fascinating. When characters act dishonorably, it throws her.\n\nThis season, Kate Sacker, the assistant United States attorney she plays on \u201cBillions,\u201d makes some less-than-aboveboard moves, and she found the filming hard. I\u2019d watched her rehearse the first scene of \u201cSaint Joan,\u201d and her Joan had been determined, girlish, joyful. Would she be more?\n\nI worried about it all the way home, from the Upper West Side back to Brooklyn, and then I read the play again. Now I\u2019m pretty sure Ms. Rashad is right about the anger and the character and probably some other things. Joan is good at converting doubters to her cause. Ms. Rashad is, too.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. I had seen her in every play from \u201cRuined,\u201d her New York debut, to last year\u2019s \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d a canny and assertive turn that brought her toe to toe with Laurie Metcalf and earned her a third Tony nomination. (Here\u2019s her mother on that part: \u201cIt was the bomb! My God, girl, where did you get that all from?\u201d) So I knew her as a persuasive performer whose incisive instincts were typically matched by scrupulous technique. She makes you feel and know and warm to her characters without ever showing how she does it.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause Ms. Rashad doesn\u2019t go in for emotional fireworks. As with Joan and her sword, they are an armament she doesn\u2019t use. Her style, which she honed at the experimental training program at the California Institute of the Arts (she grew up in Westchester and \u201cwanted to be in a place my parents would have to take a plane,\u201d she said) is more grounded and more granular. As Kenny Leon, a frequent director and a family friend said: \u201cCondola never reminds you that she\u2019s acting. She engages you because it looks like she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nJoan is her first Broadway lead since Juliet. In the fall, when her casting was confirmed, she cleared her schedule and read book after book about Joan of Arc, becoming so fluent in medieval history that she now serves as the play\u2019s unofficial dramaturge. On the day I visited rehearsal, I saw a hand-drawn map of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. She had sketched it from memory the day before.\n\nDespite her research and her training, Ms. Rashad is not an analytical actor. She believes that every character exerts a particular energy and that it\u2019s her job to \u201cmerge with that energy and trust that whatever that energy field tells you, you need to be told,\u201d she said. (She said it while wearing a hunk of black tourmaline that was supposed to connect her to her root chakra.)\n\nSo yes, the woo-woo runs deep and it extends to how she sees Joan. \u201cI think she\u2019s someone who had a very high energy quotient,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was someone open to her intentions.\u201d Maybe that all sounds pretty New Age-y, but it\u2019s rare to receive three Tony nominations by the time you turn 30, so the woo-woo seems to be working.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo merge with Joan, she has connected not to any righteous anger or Time\u2019s Up timeliness, but to the idea of being called, of aligning herself with a larger purpose. \u201cThere is a divine energy and we are all connected to it and we are all made of it,\u201d she said.\n\nObviously, Ms. Rashad and her character have different to-do lists. Joan was turning around the Hundred Years\u2019 War. Ms. Rashad is trying to prove herself as a Broadway leading lady. No one is going to burn her. Not literally anyway. But she believes that she has been called to this task just as Joan was called to hers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also someone doing what I think I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do it with intense joy.\u201d", "title": "Joan of Arc, Superstar?

The resulting poems were like high-performance cars assembled from junkyard parts, or runway fashions with the stitches intentionally showing. They were, essentially, collages.\n\nSo it felt fitting for the world to find out, late in his life, that Ashbery had for decades devoted himself to making visual collages as well, starting as a student at Harvard in the 1940s and culminating in gallery shows in his last decade. Some of these works have now been paired with poems and collected in a new book, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED: Poems & Collages (Rizzoli Electa, $35), edited by Mark Polizzotti.\n\nAshbery\u2019s images demonstrate the same sense of gleeful mischief that\u2019s everywhere in his poetry, mixing fine art with advertising and comic strips and picture postcards, all of it married with the artist\u2019s sure eye for color and mood and perspective. The result is an entire oeuvre of fantasy landscapes, such as the one in \u201cPromontory,\u201d pictured here, from 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m firmly eclectic in these and in most things,\u201d Ashbery told the poet John Yau once, in an interview included at the front of the book (itself aptly pasted together from various conversations over 10 years).

He taught there from 1951 to 1963.\n\nHis reputation as an advocate for the arts got a public airing in May 1961, when he wrote a two-part article in The Raleigh News and Observer saying that the university was failing to inspire its students of creative writing, dramatic art, music and languages.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe University hasn\u2019t been doing very well of late \u2014 I hear that wherever I go,\u201d he wrote. \u201cState College booms along.

I didn\u2019t have any ideas when he came to me.\u201d\n\nMr. Fleishman, now a professor at the Duke University School of Law, said in an email that Mr. Ehle may have been modest in his recollection. Nonetheless, Mr. Ehle soon after joined the Sanford administration as a special consultant despite his concern that the position would deprive him of the time he needed to finish a novel.\n\nAs an adviser he became a font of ideas that led to the creation of what is now the University of North Carolina School of the Arts; summer Governor\u2019s Schools for the state\u2019s brightest high school students; a state-run Learning Institute to provide research on improving education; and a state film board.

Sanford\u2019s office in May 1964, after about 18 months, and told U.S. News & World Report: \u201cWith a creative state government you can start tremendous educational and cultural programs almost beyond the imagination.\u201d\n\nHe soon began to write \u201cThe Free Men\u201d (1965), his civil rights book.\n\nBut he continued to do educational work. At the Anne C. Stouffer Foundation, which was dedicated to finding qualified black students to integrate white preparatory schools, he and Ms. Harris traveled together and audiotaped their interviews with candidates. In one recording, Mr. Ehle asked one student about his experience with integration.\n\n\u201cWell, several summers ago, I went to a camp that was integrated,\u201d the student said. \u201cBut other than that I haven\u2019t been in contact very much with, um, many white boys and girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really have any dislike for them, though, do ya?\u201d Mr. Ehle asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the student responded. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Negroes and whites can\u2019t get along.\u201d\n\nBesides Ms. Harris \u2014 who has won Tony, Emmy and Golden Globe Awards \u2014 Mr. Ehle\u2019s survivors include a daughter, Jennifer Ehle, a two-time Tony Award-winning actress, and two grandchildren.

A University of New Hampshire poll released in February found that 60 percent of the state\u2019s Republicans would support Mr. Trump again in a primary; 18 percent planned to vote for someone else. Another recent poll was more generous to Mr. Kasich, though it still showed Mr. Trump with a clear edge. And while some prominent Republicans in the state, like former Senator John E. Sununu, remain vocal Kasich defenders, few sitting officeholders have made a point of consistently challenging Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Kasich\u2019s case against Mr. Trump rests as much on tone as substance. The governor, a longtime supporter of free-trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has been sharply critical of the president\u2019s tilt toward protectionism on trade, saying it runs afoul of the Republican Party he knew. He has also lamented the president\u2019s bid to dismantle DACA, the program aimed at protecting young undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nOn this and other issues, though, Mr. Kasich has sought to contrast himself with Mr. Trump most pointedly as a spokesman for national decency.

For some, however, being invited to enter the artistic consciousness of \u2014 and, in a sense, to collaborate with \u2014 someone who is no longer alive, especially someone as imposing as Cash, proved too daunting a proposition, making several prospective contributors decide not to participate.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cEach artist has their own understanding of the creative process, and, for some, this just wasn\u2019t something they would do,\u201d said Mr. Cash. \u201cTo them, it would have been like asking Picasso to pick up a paint brush and finish a painting started by Monet. They\u2019d say, \u2018No way. I can\u2019t go there.\u2019\u201d\n\nMost of the musicians who were asked to contribute, though, relished the chance to do so, among them the perennial Grammy-winner Alison Krauss. Procuring the songwriting skills of her frequent collaborator, Robert Lee Castleman, Ms. Krauss said that she approached her track \u2014 \u201cThe Captain\u2019s Daughter,\u201d a poem rendered as an old Anglo-Celtic-style ballad \u2014 less like she was completing something that was unfinished and more like she was creating something new.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA similarly inventive approach guided Elvis Costello in his jazz-inflected reimagining of the poem, \u201cI\u2019ll Still Love You.\u201d \u201cI looked at the lyric and, before I could stifle the thought, the melody appeared in my head,\u201d Mr. Costello wrote in an email. \u201cI left Steve Berkowitz sitting at our kitchen table and went downstairs to the piano and had most of the tune completed in about 10 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s words pulled the artists there,\u201d said Mr. Cash of the inspiration for the music written for the project. Much of it was recorded at the Cash Cabin Studio his father built in Hendersonville, Tenn., some 20 miles northeast of Nashville, four decades ago.\n\n\u201cThe Brad Paisley song,\u201d Mr. Cash added, referring to \u201cGold All Over the Ground,\u201d one of several tracks based on romantic verses that Cash wrote for his wife, June Carter Cash, \u201cis, note for note, what came out of the guitar the moment he read the poem. I was there. I was sitting right there with him.\u201d\n\nEach of the artists who appear on the record identified strongly with the poem he or she set to music, but maybe no one so much as the Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell. Indeed, listening now, it\u2019s hard not to hear his despairing contribution, \u201cYou Never Knew My Mind,\u201d in light of his 2017 suicide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had those dark moments myself, just as my father had dark moments and just as Chris did,\u201d said Mr. Cash. \u201cHe and I both connected with the honesty of those lyrics.\u201d\n\nClosing the album on an aptly mystical note is the country singer Jamey Johnson\u2019s ghostly arrangement of \u201cSpirit Rider,\u201d a poem that evokes just the sort of immortality Cash longs for in \u201cForever.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you cry out I might hear you on the wind,\u201d Mr. Johnson begins. \u201cAnd if the mountains echo your love to me/Wave your heart and/I\u2019ll be riding back again.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohnny Cash\u2019s music has, and continues to have, a stubborn staying power,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, \u201cand that\u2019s because it preaches.

In the interview, they said that the love duet has challenges unlike any other in Wagner\u2019s major works. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhat is Wagner saying about love here?\n\nNELSONS The first \u201cTristan\u201d score I had was the \u201cVorspiel\u201d [prelude] in Russian, with a written Wagner quotation, like: \u201cI don\u2019t really believe in love as a feeling. But it is so strong, I want to write an opera about it.\u201d I wonder whether he actually thought that it\u2019s a crazy state of mind which is not healthy. But I find that this goes beyond the norm of what we expect of love. It\u2019s all exaggerated, over the top. It is as if it is not a real thing in life, not possible. I think he doesn\u2019t believe in this himself.\n\nKAUFMANN For that, I think he did it very well.\n\nNYLUND Maybe Wagner was also looking for something. What is love? It has to be something more than this love we speak about, the usual stuff. It\u2019s something more. But it\u2019s not something you can achieve here in your life.\n\nListen to the entire love duet\n\nHow do these ideas play out in the text?\n\nNYLUND I think they are playing some kind of word game.\n\nKAUFMANN This has alliteration and all these games Wagner loved to play, like nine-syllable words that I\u2019ve never heard put together, because sometimes he wanted to express things in a way that probably was never done before. It\u2019s like children that play a game and try to overtake each other with something more. It\u2019s insane. By the end of Act II he\u2019s completely cuckoo.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like romance in other Wagner operas.\n\nKAUFMANN Real love, or even straightforward love, doesn\u2019t exist in Wagner. In \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d you have love: one is innocent and pure, and the other is sexual. In \u201cWalk\u00fcre\u201d you have brother-and-sister love. Then you have Siegfried\u2019s love for the old lady, Br\u00fcnnhilde. All kinds of strange loves.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But usually you have the happy innocent moment of love, and then destiny strikes.\n\nNYLUND Which is here in \u201cTristan,\u201d kind of. It makes this moment of happiness even worse.\n\nHow do you pace yourselves?\n\nNYLUND You can never lose control.\n\nNELSONS For the orchestra it is challenging. Wagner writes a lot of \u201cpi\u00f9 forte,\u201d but then you have to drop down without losing any of the intensity. But it\u2019s also like when you run a marathon and there is a moment when you think you can\u2019t anymore \u2014 once you overcome that, then you lose time and go on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKAUFMANN It\u2019s not a marathon. It\u2019s like one high jump after another. And you don\u2019t have time in between to come properly back to the ground and accelerate for the next one. It\u2019s just jump, jump, jump. If on just one of those notes you hesitate \u2014 you wait a little bit because you\u2019re not sure where the harmony is or whatever \u2014 you can completely break your neck and lose your voice in a second.\n\nIs it the same with the orchestra?\n\nNELSONS Yes, but I also always think that when conducting or hearing Wagner\u2019s music it actually takes you to another psychic world as well. I feel these emotions that I cannot put into words, and the music has to show that, how you think this is going to explode. It\u2019s orgasmic.\n\nNYLUND It\u2019s actually very dangerous to drive a car and listen. You always drive much too fast.\n\nNELSONS A few conductors have died during \u201cTristan.\u201d The reason is Act II. It might seem relaxing, but actually the heartbeat and the intensity and level of excitement \u2014 it\u2019s so high that you can\u2019t stand it for a long time. So I don\u2019t want yet to die, but I might.\n\nKAUFMANN Do it on Saturday, so at least we\u2019ve done one concert.", "title": "Jonas Kaufmann: Wagner\u2019s \u2018Tristan\u2019 Is \u2018Like a Drug\u2019", "authors": ["Joshua Barone"]}

O.K.?\n\nI ask because one thing people love about the show is how it explores the ways that men can have intimacy and love in their lives outside romantic partnerships. Yes. I call this the \u201cSex and the City\u201d syndrome. We all think that we need that connection, that all-encompassing love so deep that a mountain or the ocean would be jealous, but connection does come in so many forms.\n\nThe show is filmed in Georgia, and a lot of the guys that you made over seem like jocks \u2014 guys who had friends but weren\u2019t necessarily used to opening up to other men.

I literally cannot do it. Like, if you picture me at 13, imagine big curly hair, imagine buck teeth, imagine me at 5-foot-4; I could not stop talking about, like, Miss Alabama, who had won the Miss America pageant. I could not pass if you held a gun to my head. I can\u2019t do it.\n\nWas Quincy a good environment to be out? No, not at all. It was a terrible environment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overdramatic to say that I was verbally abused, like, very constantly on an hour-to-hour basis, especially in school.

Garaufis, presents an opportunity for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to weigh in on a central legal question in the case that has divided federal courts in the past several months: Can controversial statements that Mr. Trump made on the campaign trail be used in litigation against his actions as president?\n\nAt the end of March, Judge Garaufis, who sits in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, handed down an order permitting a coalition of immigration lawyers and a group of Democratic state attorneys general to continue with two linked lawsuits challenging the repeal of a program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

{"date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "text": "Are we the only ones sensing a pattern here? Across the country, state judges are under increasing fire from lawmakers and outside groups angered by their rulings, their power, their tenure or simply their independence. That independence is, of course, central to the separation of powers, which defines American government, and to the legitimacy of the judicial branch in the eyes of the public. Going after judges for partisan reasons may not be a particularly new pastime, but it has become more popular as America\u2019s politics have become more polarized and as brute tribal warfare replaces a respect for basic democratic values.\n\nAlready in 2018, lawmakers in at least 16 states are considering at least 51 bills that would diminish or politicize the role of the judiciary, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice. Some bills would inject more politics into the judicial selection process, or into court rulings themselves. For example, Washington State lawmakers are considering whether to require every decision by the state Supreme Court to carry a \u201cfiscal note\u201d estimating the cost the decision would impose on taxpayers \u2014 which effectively puts the vindication of basic constitutional rights to a majority vote. Bills elsewhere would slash funding to the courts, shorten judicial term lengths or just eliminate seats, as has happened in North Carolina. Still others would protect legislatures from the effects of court rulings, as Kansas lawmakers are trying to do in the case of school funding. In Missouri, a proposed amendment would let voters decide whether a federal law is constitutional. If they say no, state courts will be barred from enforcing that law or hearing disputes involving it or any similar state law.\n\nMost if not all of these bills are terrible for the judiciary and harmful to democracy. But even if they don\u2019t become law, the message they send and the publicity they generate can have real consequences. This is especially true for elected judges, who may be more wary of issuing what they perceive to be controversial or unpopular rulings, for fear of blowback. That fear isn\u2019t unfounded. In 2010, three justices of the Iowa Supreme Court lost retention elections the year after they voted to legalize same-sex marriage in the state.\n\nOf course, electing judges, as is done in the majority of states, doesn\u2019t just affect their behavior. Equally important, it affects how the public perceives them. One poll found that almost nine in 10 voters said campaign contributions and spending by independent groups affect judicial decisions. Almost half of state judges agree. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that studies have found judges more likely to issue pro-business rulings when business interests donate more to judicial campaigns and less likely to rule in favor of criminal defendants when the number of TV ads related to judicial campaigns increases.\n\nBut no matter how judges get on the bench, the important thing is to keep them as insulated as possible from outside political pressures. Instead, many lawmakers in recent years have been doing the opposite, treating judges like political pawns who are, or should be, more beholden to a partisan platform or public pressure than to the law. For those lawmakers to then complain about judges acting like legislators is rich.", "title": "Opinion | Judges Shouldn\u2019t Be Partisan Punching Bags", "authors": []}

Some of those nominees would replace judges who had been appointed by other Republican presidents.\n\nBut there is no dispute that Mr. Trump has the chance to push it to the right. The dynamics of the court could change in many subtle ways \u2014 producing, for example, more sharp dissents that catch the attention of the Supreme Court, said Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society.\n\nPlus, it is hard to measure the effect of the loss of Judge Reinhardt, who was seen as a major influence on the liberal wing of the court and a talented and articulate legal protector of liberal views. \u201cThe death of Judge Reinhardt means more than the loss of a liberal vote,\u201d said Arthur Hellman, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a leading expert on the appeals court.\n\nThe mounting vacancies throw the future of the Ninth Circuit into the continuing Senate clash over the federal judiciary, one area where Mr. Trump has had success, with the enthusiastic assistance of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader.

It hardly surprised any of DiVincenzo\u2019s teammates, though, when he provided the offensive jolt.\n\n\u201cIf you keep finding him, he\u2019s going to keep knocking down shots,\u201d the freshman guard Collin Gillespie said. \u201cEarly on, I kind of knew.\u201d\n\nDiVincenzo scored 18 of Villanova\u2019s first 32 points. While his teammates hit just five of their first 17 shots, he rallied the Wildcats to a halftime lead, 37-28.\n\n\u201cHonestly, when I got into the game, all I was trying to do was play hard,\u201d DiVincenzo said. \u201cI just wanted to help my team offensively.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichigan was said to be the team of destiny a year ago, after its plane slid off a runway before the Big Ten tournament, inspiring a furious winning streak that ended in the N.C.A.A.\u2019s round of 16.\n\nBut a team-bonding trip this summer to a paintball facility in Pinckney, Mich., revealed to the coaching staff a cohesive, fun-loving group sprinkled with freshmen and seniors, each with a surprising killer instinct.\n\nMichigan was 9-5 this season when trailing at halftime, including Saturday\u2019s comeback victory against Loyola-Chicago, which propelled the Wolverines to the national championship game for the first time since 2013, when they lost to Louisville.\n\nBut even after their record-setting offensive show on Saturday, Villanova\u2019s players insisted their performance was only possible because of their defense. A team meeting in February refocused the Wildcats on the defensive end; their offense was reliable enough.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn nights when shots were not falling, though, Villanova needed to make sure it could find other ways to win \u2014 like it did Monday. Jalen Brunson showed flashes of frustration, Omari Spellman was neutralized and Paschall was conspicuously quiet.\n\nYet Villanova outrebounded Michigan, 38-27, and held the Wolverines to only three 3-pointers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you go back 20 years,\u201d Beilein said, \u201cthey would win a lot of Final Fours.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The juggernaut rolled on.\n\nVictor Mather and Joe Drape break down how Villanova beat Michigan in the championship game:\n\n2nd Half: It\u2019s the Donte DiVincenzo Show\n\nMichigan cuts Villanova\u2019s lead to 12 before Donte DiVincenzo nails a long 3-pointer. And then another. He has 27 points and Villanova leads 62-44 with seven and a half minutes to go. It\u2019s hard to see Michigan even getting to 62.\n\nDrape: I\u2019d start a team with DiVincenzo and Moritz Wagner. They are trading baskets. Sadly, neither one is likely an N.B.A. journeyman let alone a star. But they are putting on a show. When finally Matthews gets a steal and a layup to cut Villanova\u2019s lead to 12, DiVincenzo answers with back-to-back 3-pointers. Michigan needs something NOW.\n\n2nd Half: Michigan Needs a Run\n\nMikal Bridges, quiet in the first half, hits a 3 and then a layup. The lead has never quite made it to 20 points, but has never gone down to single digits either. It\u2019s 53-38 with 12 minutes to go.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n2nd Half: Things Are Getting Testy\n\nMoritz Wagner puts a hand into Omani Spellman\u2019s face and is called for an offensive foul. Words are exchanged, and there is a double technical.\n\nDrape: Moritz Wagner can\u2019t do this alone. He is going elbow to elbow, chest to chest with Villanova and just got his third foul. I don\u2019t think Beilein can take him out down 15 even though there are more than 15 minutes to play. No one has come to his or Michigan\u2019s rescue. Not looking good for the Wolverines.\n\n2nd Half: The Wildcats Roar\n\nVillanova\u2019s record-setting offense is fully on now, and its last five field goals were by five different players. The team is still only 5-for-17 from 3-point range, but other shots are falling, and Michigan is struggling to make baskets. The lead is 15.\n\n2nd Half: Villanova Picks Up Where It Left Off\n\nMoritz Wagner started the half with an easy bucket for Michigan, but Villanova answered with a basket by Mikal Bridges and then a 3-pointer and a 2-pointer by Eric Paschall. Villanova leads by 44-30 and the game is slipping away from Michigan.\n\nDrape: Eric Paschall was invisible in the first half, but then he pops a 3-pointer and takes it to the rim, and suddenly Villanova is up 14 points. He is a testament to how Villanova Coach Jay Wright finds used, or at least tarnished parts. Paschall, a redshirt junior transferred from Fordham. Against Kansas, Paschall scored 24 points on 10-of-11 field goals, including 4-of-5 from behind the 3-point line. Michigan is in trouble if he wakes up.\n\nHalftime: Villanova Establishes Control\n\nMichigan had a 7-point lead and was playing swarming defense, and Villanova couldn\u2019t make a 3-pointer. Fans could be forgiven for thinking an upset was in the cards. But a run of baskets by reserve Donte DiVincenzo helped Villanova take the lead, and as the half drew to a close, the favorites looked like favorites with a 37-28 lead. DiVincenzo had 18 points, including three of the team\u2019s four 3-pointers (a far cry from the 13 they hit in the first half against Kansas.)\n\nMoritz Wagner of Michigan looked great for five minutes, but mostly vanished thereafter and wound up with 11 points and five rebounds. Villanova\u2019s 4-for-13 3-point shooting seemed slightly disappointing until compared with Michigan\u2019s 2-13.\n\nDrape: Jalen Brunson, the national player of the year, was having a quiet night until he popped a 3-pointer with 15 seconds left to put Villanova up 37-28. His teammate Mikal Bridges, a projected lottery pick, has been even quieter: 4 points. Still the Wildcats go into a halftime with a 9-point lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichigan Coach John Beilein should be worried. If those two have finally found their groove, the Wolverines are going to get run out of the arena. The Wolverines have defended the 3-pointer (no surprise, they are the best in the nation) and held the Wildcats to just 30 percent shooting from beyond the arc. Still, Villanova has moved inside and shot 45 percent to Michigan\u2019s 39 percent. The Wildcats have outrebounded Michigan 20-14.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Moritz Wagner is a force, but he needs help. Pink Shoes (Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman) has stepped up, but the rest of the Wolverines have been dismal. One of them needs a DiVincenzo-like second half. My money is on Matthews, who is just 1 of 5 and has essentially disappeared. Look for Michigan to get him the ball early. The first six minutes of the second half will show us if Michigan can stop the bleeding and push Villanova into a back and forth game. Very good first half; looking for a better second half.\n\n1st Half: Brunson Buries a Big 3\n\nJalen Brunson buries his first 3-pointer, with Michigan\u2019s defenders conspicuously absent. Michigan misses, and it\u2019s 37-28 Villanova, with the Wildcats also getting the last shot with 12 seconds to play.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo?\n\nSlam dunk by the revelatory Donte DiVincenzo. His season high was 30 against Butler, so he has the ability to run up a big number. Then Spellman adds a dunk. Meanwhile, Michigan is doing a lot of missing, including their last seven from 3-point range. It\u2019s 34-28 Villanova, and with a minute and a half to go, Michigan calls timeout.\n\nDrape: There is recruiting and there is being in the right place at the right time. Ask Donte DiVincenzo. He was on recruiters\u2019 radars: he was ranked as the No. 124 player in the country and the 37th-best shooting guard as a high school senior. He was also the top-rated player in Delaware, not all that far from Villanova\u2019s campus in Philadelphia. His decision was between Syracuse and Villanova until his high school team visited Villanova to watch a practice. He\u2019s got 18 points in the national championship right now.\n\n1st Half: Villanova Takes the Lead\n\nVillanova takes the lead with its third 3-pointer of the game, all by Donte DiVincenzo. Michigan has been called for 8 fouls, to Villanova\u2019s 4. With a 30-26 lead and the momentum, Villanova starting to look like the favorite for the first time. DiVincenzo now has 14 points, while his more heralded teammates Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson have 4 apiece.\n\nDrape: Villanova is showing they are the real thing, and can give as good as they get. DiVincenzo bangs a 3-pointer, then drives and gets fouled. He misses the free throw, but Villanova is up 30-26 with 3:59 left. So far, we are getting what we were hoping for: a well played, high octane game between the two best teams in the country.\n\n1st Half: A Game of Threes\n\nThis is a matchup between the best 3-point shooting team in the nation in Villanova (and all of college basketball according to the record book) and the best defending 3-point team in Michigan. So far, the Wolverines are defending better than the Wildcats are shooting. They lead, 21-16.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1st Half: Michigan Leads Early Behind Strong Defense\n\nCharles Matthews has a block and a steal already as Michigan continues its outstanding team defense. Villanova turns to its bench to try to turn things around: Donte Divinceno finally hits the team\u2019s first 3-pointer, then completes a 3-point play. But Michigan\u2019s own bench player Jordan Poole answers to give Michigan an 18-14 lead with 12 minutes left in the half.\n\nDrape: It\u2019s the shoes. The pink ones. Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman first wore them on February 14 to honor breast cancer victims. He\u2019s worn them ever since and the Wolverines are on a 14 game winning streak. I took my son and nephew to the Big Ten tournament and they fell in love with \u201cPink Shoes,\u201d as they called Abdur Rahkman. It seems that is the nickname his teammates have given him. Every prognosticator in the media world predicted Villanova would blow Michigan out. Wolverines are not letting that happen.\n\n1st Half: Two Easy Baskets\n\nAfter all the talk of 3-pointers, the game started on the inside, with each team making a couple of easy buckets. Jalen Brunson and Moritz Wagner were the first to score, but Wagner of Michigan hit the first 3 of the game, giving Michigan a 9-4 lead. In contrast to Kansas in the semifinal, Michigan is swarming Villanova much more aggressively. With 14 minutes left there is a TV timeout and Michigan leads, 11-8. Still no 3\u2019s from Villanova.\n\nDrape: Unlike in the national semifinals, both teams have come out loose and effective. Michigan\u2019s Wagner has taken it to the hole confidently. The Wolverines have set a tone that they were not going to be intimidated. They want to control the tempo and they have. Wagner has been the spark plug. He hit a big 3-pointer. Then banked it inside on a twisting drive. He has the predominately-Michigan crowd into the game. They are not going to let Villanova shoot them out of the game like the Wildcats did to Kansas early.", "title": "Juggernaut Villanova Crushes Michigan to Win N.C.A.A.

A spokeswoman said the college \u201cis fully cooperating with their request for information,\u201d but could not provide further comment.\n\nIn 2016, Amherst\u2019s dean of admissions told U.S. News that the college and about 30 others shared lists of students admitted through early decision, and that she would also be open to sharing the names of students who chose not to attend and for what reasons.\n\nEarly decision acceptances are not legally binding, but they do reflect a \u201cmoral contract\u201d with students, securing peace of mind in securing a spot at their first-choice school in exchange for a commitment that they won\u2019t shop around for other admissions packages.\n\nColleges will release students from their early-decision commitments if they face financial or familial hardship, but to breach the contract can be consequential.\n\nCollege counselors say that depending on the institutions, the repercussions could range from schools canceling a student\u2019s applications to rescinding admissions offers. A university could also retaliate against the student\u2019s high school by limiting the number of students they admit.\n\n\u201cOnce a student signs something, they have you.

Many colleges and universities rely on early decisions to demonstrate a high \u201cyield,\u201d the percentage of admitted students who enroll, which bolsters a school\u2019s selectivity in national rankings.\n\nEarly decision programs have afforded some colleges nearly half of their freshman classes. Duke University reported last year that its early-decision applicants comprised just under 51 percent of its freshman class.\n\nMr. Meister is up front with parents and students when he advises them on the college application process, telling them that the college admissions world is small and that \u201cpeople talk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI would never assume as a high school counselor, that I\u2019d have to tell them there are official back channels that could hinder your chances of getting into other schools,\u201d Mr. Meister said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s illegal to do, but it\u2019s wrong to do. If there\u2019s some coordinated policy, that is extremely concerning and warrants some sort of action.\u201d\n\nMr. Hartle said he found the Justice Department\u2019s inquiry into early admissions programs surprising, given that only about 200 schools of the more than 4,000 in the country use early decision. \u201cGiven that this doesn\u2019t affect many schools, or many students, it\u2019s the ultimate first-world problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Association for College Admission Counseling said in a statement that it is monitoring the early decision inquiry closely, as it could affect some of its members. But the organization maintained that it had no information about what the government might be seeking, or why.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division began an inquiry into the organization\u2019s new code of ethics and professional practice in November. The association said it did not believe that was connected to the new early admission inquiry.\n\nThe ethics code included new policies and practices related to student disciplinary infractions, financial aid award letters and the recruitment of students who have already enrolled at other colleges. It also tightened restrictions on the use of housing deadlines to manipulate commitments.\n\nThe Justice Department is also investigating the role of affirmative action in admissions at Harvard University amid a lawsuit from Asian-American students who say they were discriminated against.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "Los Angeles has for years received millions of dollars under the federal Community Oriented Policing Services program, which is meant to promote community policing. The city police department has used the money for its Community Safety Partnership, which allows police officers to spend intensive time in neighborhoods, leading mentoring programs or coaching sports teams. The police say the program in the neighborhood of Watts has helped bring about a 50 percent reduction in violent crime and arrests.\n\nIn 2016, the city used the roughly $3 million it received to hire about 25 officers. City officials asked for the same amount of money in 2017, hoping to use it to hire more officers in a South Los Angeles neighborhood where violence had spiked.\n\nBut police departments around the country seeking a share of the $98 million pool of grant money last year were asked to demonstrate that they have a policy of alerting immigration agents before releasing inmates and giving immigration agents access to jails in order to conduct inmate interviews and review files. Departments were also asked to give federal authorities 48-hours notice before the release of any immigrants.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Deparment did not do so, and was awarded no money. The Justice Department said the vast majority of those departments that received grants had signaled a \u201cwillingness to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s lawsuit argued that local governments had \u201can untenable choice: Commit to participating in federal civil immigration investigation and enforcement efforts, or sacrifice funds for public safety and community policing.\u201d\n\nIn the ruling, Judge Real said that the funding rules violated the notion of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and improperly tried to force local police officers to take on immigration enforcement, which legally is the responsibility of the federal government.

There is a black comedy here, in Peter Quayle\u2019s character, because Quayle \u2014 this philandering, underqualified, good-looking young guy \u2014 is a manifestation of privilege. We get to turn that inside out. And in the satirical manner of the last episode, Peter Quayle gets everything he ever wanted at the worst possible time.\n\nI want to fill in Mira, the woman who trained Claire at the Indigo school for sleeper agents, because their ideology is a very important story for us in Season 2.\n\nWhat about Emily Alpha? She figured out all the intrigue before anyone else did, and then spent the season in a coma. But now she\u2019s starting to wake up.\n\nThere is always a temptation when you have that wife in a coma to idealize her, which is a little misogynistic, too. The only way we could convince Olivia Williams to do this show was to pitch her the two-season plan of who both Emilys are, and that the woman in the coma is in fact much more complex than any other character. Both Emilys, those are job descriptions that are typically reserved for the George Smileys of the world, the James Bonds of the world. [During filming] Olivia was walking through one scene with another male character, whose position is actually underneath her in the hierarchy of the show, but even then, the background actors look at the male she\u2019s walking with and sort of nod, \u201cYes, sir\u201d to him, not realizing that she\u2019s the one who\u2019s actually in charge in that scene. The clich\u00e9s that abound, they speak to a certain gender norm that we didn\u2019t want the show to reflect.\n\nBetween Quayle and Claire and Howard and Emily, this is also a show about marriage. Does the writers\u2019 room feel like a therapy session sometimes?\n\nAll we do is therapy on this show! We spend most of our time talking about ideas of identity and relationships. Emily Alpha has her own flaws, and own methods that she\u2019s gone through that are less wholesome, let\u2019s say? But Howard Alpha is aware of that, and that\u2019s okay. This is a contract that they have as husband and wife. So we wanted to be able to invert that and be able to create a marriage that felt very human, and very true to the marriages I know. Two of our writers are actually married. Which two writers, I will leave for their own privacy, but they met in the room as well, so you can imagine it brings us all into very close proximity with each other, when it comes to being honest and vulnerable.\n\nYou play a character as well, as a cameo.\n\nThe smarmy teenager who walks Stephen Rea\u2019s dog!

He is also in the Hall of Fame, and is under contract through the 2021-22 season.\n\nDescriptions of the players newly identified in the new indictment match those of three top players: Smith, who played one season for North Carolina State before being drafted ninth overall by the Dallas Mavericks last year; Billy Preston, who committed to Kansas but never played because the school and the N.C.A.A. were investigating him; and Silvio De Sousa, who just completed his freshman season at Kansas. The two sources familiar with the investigation confirmed that the second player was Preston.\n\nAccording to the indictment, an N.C. State coach informed Gassnola that the first player was wavering from his verbal commitment to the Wolfpack during the fall of his senior year of high school. In response, prosecutors said, Gassnola gave $40,000 to the coach, who implied the money would go to the player\u2019s father, while Gatto used invoices that were ostensibly for other expenses to reimburse Gassnola.\n\nSmith appears in documents that were published in February by Yahoo Sports, and which indicate that Dawkins had courted him when he worked for a sports agency whose offices have been raided by the F.B.I.\n\nThe mother of the second player, Preston, received at least $90,000 from Adidas via an A.A.U. team she ran, prosecutors said, with Gatto generating phony invoices for things such as a \u201cBasketball Team Tournaments Fee\u201d to justify the expenditures. The cash transfers included a $30,000 handover in a New York City hotel room, prosecutors said. All in all, Adidas paid more than $200,000 to the A.A.U. team, though some of this was intended for the mother, they said.\n\nA third player, whose description matches De Sousa, had committed to a team sponsored by a rival apparel company, prosecutors said, but preferred to attend Kansas. To get out of that commitment, De Sousa\u2019s guardian said, he would need $40,000 to repay money he had received in exchange for making that initial commitment, and the adviser and Gatto agreed to reimburse him, prosecutors said.\n\nDe Sousa had been considered likely to attend Maryland, which is sponsored by Under Armour, before committing to Kansas. Maryland did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe superseding indictment includes allegations from the original indictment from last November concerning Louisville and Miami. Gatto, among others, sought to funnel $100,000 to the family of Brian Bowen, a Louisville signee (though the Bowens only received about $25,000) and $150,000 to a Miami recruit.

There are conflicting accounts as to what was said and done next, but there was little doubt that the brawny Murdoch had gratified the guard\u2019s wish and left him with a black eye.\n\nGiven the guard\u2019s provocation, most teammates expected Murdoch to face limited disciplinary action. Instead he was ordered to leave the tour and go home. His teammates accused the tour manager, Ernie Todd, who was struggling with the cancer that would kill him, of caving in to pressure from British officials and the news media.\n\nTo this day Murdoch remains the only All Black to have been sent home from an international tour.\n\nBut Murdoch, in fact, did not go home. Issued with a ticket back to New Zealand, he got off the plane in Singapore and diverted to Australia \u2014 to the city of Darwin, on the northern coast, the gateway to the vast, sparsely populated Northern Territory.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there, for all intents and purposes, he disappeared. He \u201cwent bush,\u201d as the Australians say. He became a rugby version of Bigfoot and the subject of a play, his legend growing in inverse proportion to the confirmed sightings of him.\n\nIndeed, the world outside the drilling sites and sheep stations of the Outback heard about him only a handful of times and not at all after 2001. Until, that is, on March 31, when the All Blacks, having received word from members of his family, announced on its Twitter feed that Murdoch had died the day before at 74.\n\nDoug Baughan, the chairman of Zingari Richmond, the club for which Murdoch once played in his home city, Dunedin, said of the death that \u201cthe exact circumstances are not yet clear\u201d \u2014 a statement that could have applied to almost the last 46 years of Murdoch\u2019s life.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKeith Murdoch was born in Dunedin on Sept. 9, 1943. He was educated at King Edward Technical College and played his first adult rugby match for Zingari Richmond before breaking onto the Otago team in 1964. Vying to join the vaunted All Blacks, he played in several trials, but it wasn\u2019t until 1970 \u2014 when he toured with Otago in South Africa \u2014 that he was invited to join the national team.\n\nThe Wales match was his third and last international contest for the All Blacks.\n\nAfter \u201cgoing bush,\u201d Murdoch dropped from sight until the late 1970s, when Terry McLean, the dean of New Zealand\u2019s rugby writers, tracked him down. McLean came upon him at an oil-drilling site near Perth, capital of the state of Western Australia, only to be advised, firmly and crisply, what he should do to preserve life and limb.\n\n\u201cI got back on the bus,\u201d McLean wrote.\n\nMurdoch was reported to have returned briefly to New Zealand a few years later, and to have rescued a child from drowning in a swimming pool. But he was soon back in Australia.\n\nIn 1990, Margot McRae, a journalist who was then working as a television researcher, found Murdoch working on a farm in a remote part of Queensland, in northeastern Australia. She found him more receptive than McLean had, describing him as \u201cvery happy in himself.\u201d But she likened extracting information from him during a 45-minute conversation, conducted entirely off-camera, as \u201cgetting blood from a stone.\u201d\n\nShe quoted him as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell my story to anyone.\u201d\n\nMcRae went on to write a play about him, \u201cFinding Murdoch,\u201d which had its premiere in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2007.\n\nMurdoch resurfaced publicly for the final time in 2001, following the death of a 20-year-old man who had last been seen trying to break into Murdoch\u2019s home in Tennant Creek, in the Northern Territory. After being questioned twice by the police and called to testify at an inquest, he broke his media silence to insist that he had been called purely as a witness. No charges were filed for lack of evidence, the authorities said, and the investigation was closed in 2002.\n\nThe rugby historian Lindsay Knight once wrote of Murdoch, \u201cNo All Black has been more controversial, more enigmatic and more tragic.\u201d", "title": "Keith Murdoch, Rugby Bruiser Who Vanished in the Outback, Is Dead at 74", "authors": ["Huw Richards"]}

Philip Glass, never quite beloved in the academic realm, remains Pulitzer-less. And I\u2019ll just leave this right here: Kanye.\n\nYou could play these games forever. It is belated and necessary that the award widen to encompass a fuller picture of what music is. But if that widening further marginalizes noncommercial work \u2014 which doesn\u2019t view itself as exclusive but simply as endangered in an economic system that conspires against it \u2014 something important will be lost.

Mr. Gilbertson, 30 as well, wrote a string quartet that veers from glassy to robust, and Mr. Hearne, 35, wrote \u201cSound From the Bench,\u201d a cantata for chamber choir, electric guitars and drums. Like Mr. Lamar\u2019s album, the finalists are politically charged: Mr. Hearne, always socially conscious, here mashes up texts from Supreme Court decisions to suggest the ambiguities of identity and humanity. (A corporation has speech, you say?) And Mr. Gilbertson has said that he adjusted his initial sketches for his quartet after the 2016 election, making them \u201cmore introspective and comforting.\u201d Almost as significant as Mr. Lamar\u2019s win, for me, is the trio taken together: a new generation, turning the world around it into music.\n\nPARELES I\u2019ll have to put them in a playlist. I\u2019m not suggesting that the Pulitzers mirror the Top 10 or the Grammys. (Please, no.) And next year, sure, give the prize to an album that sold 11 copies after a lone college gig somewhere. But I think we\u2019re seeing a shifting perspective on the way contemporary classical and jazz composition often draw on the ideas of hip-hop or world music or pop, as if to elevate them by carrying them into the concert hall.\n\nAccording to the Pulitzer reporting, \u201cDAMN.\u201d got added to consideration when the jury was looking into a composition with hip-hop influences, and decided to go to the source \u2014 where the ideas, in this case, are even stronger, both rawer and smarter. The prize citation praises \u201cDAMN.\u201d for its \u201cvernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism,\u201d which to me has a whiff of condescension \u2014 there\u2019s all sorts of brainpower and artifice in there, too \u2014 but let\u2019s enjoy the win.

In its core car-hailing business, drivers own their cars and connect them to Uber\u2019s network, but Uber will own the bikes itself, and will need to learn how to manage its own fleet of two-wheeled vehicles.\n\nChina Cracks Down on Bytedance\n\nMy colleague Raymond Zhong had a great story this week about Bytedance, a Chinese internet start-up that has \u201cmastered the art of keeping people glued to their smartphones.\u201d Bytedance, which operates a collection of apps that connect users with news, viral videos and other forms of entertainment, drew the anger of Chinese internet censors.\n\nThe agency ordered Bytedance to shut down Neihan Duanzi, an app for silly videos and joke memes that \u201ccaused strong dislike among internet users,\u201d according to China\u2019s State Administration of Radio and Television. At least two other Bytedance apps have also disappeared from app stores.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating look at the opposition faced by Chinese tech start-ups, which makes Facebook\u2019s grilling before Congress look positively mild. And it\u2019s a glimpse of the kind of dilemmas that could await Facebook if it ever does fulfill Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s long-held goal of getting into China.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018Despacito\u2019 Goes M.I.A.\n\nIn devastating news for fans of catchy summer jams, the music video for \u201cDespacito,\u201d the Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee song, briefly disappeared from YouTube on Tuesday after hackers broke into the account of Vevo, the company that hosted the video.

{"date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "text": "First, it\u2019s an unusually clear example of the double-edged nature of artificial intelligence. Google has spent billions of dollars teaching computers to play Go, drive cars and translate languages on the fly. The company has been extremely proud of its advances in machine learning, even releasing some of its tools to the public via open-source frameworks like TensorFlow, which provides a fascinating contrast to what\u2019s happening inside the company now. When its image-classification algorithms are used to spot tumors on radiology scans, Google puts out a press release, and engineers cheer. But when these same types of algorithms are used by the Pentagon to improve the accuracy of drone strikes, it\u2019s a moral outrage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

He used the examples of the atomic bomb, which forever changed the way that physics was taught in universities, and dynamite, which made chemists aware of the consequences of their expertise. It\u2019s not hard to see A.I. as a similar kind of turning point for computer scientists \u2014 and if it is, the Google-Pentagon issue might be the first of many similar fights.\n\nSecond, the Google-Pentagon incident is a revealing story about the leverage that Silicon Valley engineers have over their companies. Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight, and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent, these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than, say, regulators or outside activists. If an antiwar group protests outside Google\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s an annoyance. But if 3,000 engineers walk out, it\u2019s a crisis. And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning, executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn\u2019t regulation, it\u2019s rebellion from within.\n\nAmazon and the Postal Service\n\nI\u2019ve also been following the feud between Amazon and President Trump this week, which has led to a bull market for explainers about the business models of the United States Postal Service. My colleague Nick Wingfield wrote that, contra President Trump, the available evidence suggests that \u201cAmazon has been a boon to the Postal Service.\u201d But Vox\u2019s Jen Kirby added that, because the exact details of the contract between Amazon and the Postal Service aren\u2019t known, it\u2019s possible that President Trump is partly right: \u201cMaybe the U.S.P.S. isn\u2019t actually making the best deals.\u201d Meanwhile, Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, says President Trump is \u201cactually right\u201d that Amazon is ripping off the federal government through its U.S.P.S. contracts.\n\nI\u2019m a nonexpert on the subject of parcel shipping, so my opinion on Amazon\u2019s the -U.S.P.S. probably isn\u2019t worth one first-class stamp. But it\u2019s possible, and maybe plausible, that all of these analyses are partly correct \u2014 that the Postal Service benefits from Amazon\u2019s dominance, and that Amazon is getting a sweetheart deal that should be re-examined. Anyway, Amazon\u2019s stock dipped sharply after President Trump started tweeting angry things about it, but it has now recovered to its pre-tweetstorm levels, meaning that investors may be as confused as I am.\n\nThe YouTube Shooting\n\nLast, and most obvious, the horrific shooting at YouTube on Tuesday, which injured three people and left the company badly shaken. As more details have emerged on Nasim Najafi Aghdam, whom the police have identified as the attacker, it has become increasingly clear that this was a new kind of violence \u2014 an act of revenge by an internet creator against the platform that she felt controlled her economic destiny. As my colleagues Nellie Bowles and Jack Nicas wrote, \u201cMs. Aghdam\u2019s complaints echoed what a wide range of YouTube posters \u2014 from self-described animal rights activists like her to right-wing political provocateurs \u2014 have increasingly been protesting over the last year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren\u2019t just websites anymore. They\u2019re powerful economies unto themselves, and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people, a few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses.\n\nKevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Those members bought five billion items in 2017, making it the company\u2019s biggest year on record.\n\nWhile the median salary at Facebook, a company full of well-fed engineers, is a whopping $240,430, Amazon\u2019s median worker salary is only $28,446, reflecting its reliance on an army of low-paid workers at its fulfillment centers. Amazon has been criticized for grueling labor conditions and creepy employee-tracking practices, but the workers keep showing up. As a result, Amazon has become America\u2019s second-largest private employer, behind only Walmart.\n\nAs Jason Del Rey at Recode noted, many of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center employees likely aren\u2019t Prime subscribers, since the service has \u201cskewed way more popular among higher-income households\u201d than among working-class families. Amazon is trying to broaden its appeal beyond the mass affluent by introducing monthly payment plans and discounts for people on government assistance, but there is still room for competition on the lower end of the market.

The coach, he wrote, warned his friend that realistically, she would need to spend six months practicing. The story taught him that \u201cto achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne thing notably absent from Mr. Bezos\u2019 letter was any mention of HQ2, the company\u2019s much-ballyhooed search for a second headquarters.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "Twitter\u2019s Good Quarter\n\nTwitter reported its earnings and showed \u2014 for the second straight quarter, and the second time in its history \u2014 that it is capable of turning a profit.\n\nThat profit was minuscule by Facebook standards: just $61 million in the quarter, compared with the $3 billion Facebook pulled in. But the fact that Twitter is in the black at all is enough to stave off the doomsday narrative that once swirled around it.\n\nInterestingly, one of the factors driving Twitter\u2019s growth this time around is strong performance in its data licensing business, which has grown 20 percent year over year.\n\nData licensing \u2014 or, more accurately, data donating \u2014 is the part of Facebook\u2019s business that got it into trouble because of Cambridge Analytica. And although Twitter\u2019s data licensing program is substantively different from Facebook\u2019s \u2014 it collects a narrower set of personal information from users, and licenses only users\u2019 tweets, which are already public \u2014 it\u2019s interesting that Twitter is leaning into the business of making user data available to third parties at the same time that Facebook is leaning out of it. It also creates a dilemma for lawmakers and regulators. If they try to prevent future Cambridge Analytica data leaks by restricting social platforms\u2019 abilities to license data to third-party developers, they could end up hurting Facebook\u2019s rivals more than Facebook.\n\nSnapchat\u2019s Spectacles Do-Over\n\nSnap, the parent company of Snapchat, doesn\u2019t report earnings until next week. But ahead of its report, the company announced a surprising move: a new version of its camera-equipped sunglasses, Spectacles. The first version of Spectacles was famously a commercial flop, leading the company to take a $40 million write-down on unsold pairs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

In its previous redesign, Snapchat separated user-generated Snap stories from professional publisher stories on its Discover tab. In the new test version, those stories live together on the Discover tab.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZoom out a bit, and you can see the bigger shift at work here. After an attempt to distinguish itself from platforms like Instagram and Facebook \u2014 both of which feature algorithmically sorted feeds that intermingle content from your friends and content from celebrities and publishers \u2014 Snap may be finding that users liked Snapchat better when it was more like every other social feed.\n\nYouTube\u2019s Profitable Trust Crisis\n\nYouTube, which has long insisted that it\u2019s not a social network, is yet another example of a social platform\u2019s prospering financially despite deepening mistrust among users.\n\nIts parent company, Alphabet, doesn\u2019t break out YouTube-specific numbers. But in its earnings report this week, the company said overall advertising revenue, which includes YouTube ads, grew 24 percent year over year.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, also boasted that the company\u2019s algorithms had pulled down millions of YouTube videos that violated the platform\u2019s rules before they were seen by humans. Still, the company clearly has much more work to do. As BuzzFeed News reported this week, YouTube is still host to tons of horrible, offensive and dangerous videos, including a number of bestiality videos apparently aimed at children.\n\nYouTube has tried to address the problem in part by introducing new parental controls, but history tells us that this may be an unwinnable battle. As its algorithms get more sophisticated at detecting objectionable content, the makers of those videos will learn ways to evade the system, and new forms of objectionable videos will appear (at least until journalists find them and point them out).\n\nMore broadly, despite not thinking of itself as a social network, YouTube is perhaps the network that is most similar to Facebook right now, in terms of the challenges it faces and the disconnect between what many of its users want (more active moderation, less objectionable content) and what investors want (more of the same, please!).\n\nI\u2019ve been reading an early copy of Jaron Lanier\u2019s excellent new book, \u201cTen Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now.\u201d Mr. Lanier, a well-known technologist who did pioneering work in virtual reality, has become a kind of Cassandra for the tech industry. He says that the current crop of social media giants have become profit-driven behavioral modification machines that undermine truth, destroy empathy and turn their users into jerks, and that until healthier systems emerge, we should all stay off them.\n\nI\u2019m predisposed to disagree with that kind of generalized argument. Despite everything we\u2019ve learned this year, I still believe that social networks, when designed and managed properly, can be a positive force. Moreover, I\u2019m skeptical that getting users to boycott these services is possible, given how addictive they are.\n\nBut it\u2019s not hard to see where Mr. Lanier is coming from, especially during a week like this, when the opposing forces pulling on social networks are clear. Social media companies are being urged to behave more responsibly by users, lawmakers and occasionally their own employees. But investors have no stake in maximizing the long-term health of society. They\u2019re just happy to see growth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine.

{"date": "2018-04-18 00:00:00", "text": "In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates.\n\nBefore looking ahead, it\u2019s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries.\n\nOn March 23, tariffs were applied to imports of steel and aluminum from countries that were not granted an exemption. Those currently enjoying the reprieve are Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Brazil and members of the European Union.\n\nThe next big deadline is May 1, which is when the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs expire. Between now and then, members of the Trump administration have to decide whether they want to take an action that could upset staunch allies of the United States. The United States may extend the exemptions if discussions occur or make them permanent if, say, countries agree to side with the United States in its trade offensive against China.\n\nBut holding off on the steel and aluminum tariffs for a long time might embolden China, which the United States has targeted with separate actions that focus on China alone. These include two sets of tariffs, one on $50 billion of goods and a threated second set on products worth $100 billion, as well as an action at the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe administration can\u2019t announce a final list of goods for the $50 billion of tariffs until May 22. That is when the period for public responses to the tariffs ends. Trade law gives President Trump the power to then impose the tariffs quickly, but it also provides him significant flexibility on the timing.\n\nThe trade legislation states that the United States would have to act within 12 months of the date at which the United States trade representative initiated its investigation of Chinese trade practices. This implies the Trump administration has until August 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the legislation suggests it has even more latitude. Once the administration has determined what actions it will take, it can in theory delay putting them into effect by 180 days. Hypothetically, President Trump could stretch things into early next year.\n\nMuch remains up in the air, though.\n\nMr. Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. He could argue for extended exemptions for Canada and Mexico, which are also involved in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. South Korea may also end up with significant tariff exemptions as a result of a trade agreement that country is apparently close to forging with the United States. And that action against China at the World Trade Organization could take years.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nMorgan Stanley has done it. Sort of.\n\nOne of Wall Street\u2019s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter\u2019s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses.\n\nGoldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley\u2019s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall.\n\nA big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman\u2019s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nRecord profit for Morgan Stanley\n\nThe Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law.\n\n\u2022 Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected.\n\n\u2022 Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion.\n\n\u2022 Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion.\n\n\u2022 Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago\n\n\u2022 Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion.\n\n\u2022 Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion.\n\n\u2022 Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million.\n\n\u2022 Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent.\n\n\u2022 Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion.\n\nThe U.S. debt profile could be worst than Italy\u2019s by 2023.\n\nBloomberg reports that the latest data from the International Monetary Fund projects U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio to \u201cwiden to 116.9 percent by 2023 while Italy\u2019s is seen narrowing to 116.6 percent.\u201d\n\nThe I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo much for the U.S. rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\nThat seems out \u2014 for now, anyway, given President Trump\u2019s tweet from Mar-a-Lago yesterday: \u201cToo many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Here are a few takeaways about the end of a public flirtation:\n\n\u2022 Trade partners and allies are again left wondering about the White House\u2019s trade policy. That\u2019s especially pertinent as the U.S. continues to feud with China; yesterday the F.C.C. blocked wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy Chinese telecom equipment.\n\n\u2022 The tweet put Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who\u2019s at Mar-a-Lago with Mr. Trump, in an awkward position. Japan has been leery of a bilateral trade pact with the U.S., since it risks having to make more concessions than in the TPP with little hope of much in return.

Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from \u201ccookies\u201d that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate.\n\nAnother thought on Google\u2019s weaknesses, from our colleague Mike Isaac:\n\nPhoto\n\nElsewhere in privacy: Facebook has previewed how its privacy policies are changing to comply with European regulations.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "The travel ban is not the only one of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies under challenge. Several federal judges, including one on Tuesday, have blocked its efforts to end a separate program that shields some undocumented young adults from deportation. Those cases on the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, are also likely to reach the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s first travel ban, issued in January 2017, was promptly blocked by courts around the nation. A second version, issued two months later, fared little better, though the Supreme Court allowed part of it to go into effect in June when it agreed to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeals from two appeals court losses. But the Supreme Court dismissed those appeals in October after the second ban expired.\n\nThe current ban initially restricted travel from eight countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, Venezuela and North Korea \u2014 six of which were predominantly Muslim. Chad was recently removed from the list.\n\nThe restrictions vary in their details, but, for the most part, citizens of the countries are prohibited from immigrating to the United States, and many are barred from working, studying or vacationing here.\n\nIn December, in a sign that the Supreme Court may uphold the latest order, the court allowed it to go into effect as the case moved forward. The decision effectively overturned a compromise in place since June, when the court said travelers with connections to the United States could continue to travel here notwithstanding restrictions in an earlier version of the ban.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented from the December ruling.\n\nHawaii, several individuals and a Muslim group challenged the latest ban\u2019s limits on travel from the predominantly Muslim nations; they did not object to the portions concerning North Korea and Venezuela. They prevailed before a Federal District Court in Hawaii and before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that Mr. Trump had exceeded the authority that Congress had given him over immigration and had violated a part of the immigration laws barring discrimination in the issuance of visas.", "title": "Key Justices Seem Skeptical of Challenge to Trump\u2019s Travel Ban", "authors": []}

Negotiators from both Koreas have agreed on a rough framework for the joint declaration, he said.\n\nThey are still discussing other aspects of the joint statement, such as whether the two Koreas would commit to holding summit meetings on a regular basis, Mr. Im said.

Director Mike Pompeo to suggest some. \u201cFrom the administration\u2019s perspective,\u201d he replied, \u201cthe most important thing we can do is \u2026 separate capacity, and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.\u201d\n\nIt was an unmistakable call for regime change, and Pompeo promised that the intelligence community would provide \u201ca wide range of options for the president about how we might go about that.\u201d Apparently they came up short. Hence the interest in negotiation.\n\nYet the fact that all the options are bad does not, as some argue, make negotiations the \u201cleast bad\u201d among them. Sanctions relief and economic concessions help keep the Kim regime in power and in business, funding the nuclear programs those concessions are supposed to stop.\n\nNegotiations also dignify and legitimize a regime that, alongside Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad, is the worst violator of human rights in the world today. Spare a thought, while watching the two Korean presidents behave like old friends, for the 80,000 to 130,000 prisoners enslaved in Pyongyang\u2019s gulags.\n\nWorst of all, the negotiations will tempt Trump to indulge his worst isolationist impulses. Last month, he again hinted that he would withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea if he doesn\u2019t get better trading terms. That would have been music to Kim\u2019s ear, since a fundamental goal of North Korean policy is to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.\n\nA peace deal between the United States and North Korea to establish formal relations and end the Korean War would be hailed, even by many liberals, as a signal diplomatic triumph. Fox News would clamor for Trump to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. But it would advance a central aim of North Korean and Chinese foreign policy by undercutting the rationale for maintaining sizable U.S. forces in South Korea.\n\nThat might be a worthwhile price to pay in exchange for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the North. But as The Washington Post\u2019s Richard Cohen aptly noted the other day, \u201cNorth Korea without a nuclear arsenal is like Saudi Arabia without oil.\u201d It isn\u2019t going to happen unless Kim has lost his taste for power or gained a sense of remorse.

Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.\n\nFacebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.\n\nThe hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said this week that the company would make tools for the European privacy rules available for all users, but Facebook has not specified if stronger privacy would be the default for global users. Other internet and online advertising firms have criticized the European rules known as General Data Protection Regulation as onerous.\n\nNevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\n\n\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201d\n\nBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.\n\nNarrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.\n\nA big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.\n\nIn 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.\n\nInternet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.\n\nAnother obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.\n\nHe mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\n\n\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.\n\nDiversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.\n\nMs. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is.

They then stepped back into South Korean territory, holding hands, and walked down a red carpet to inspect a South Korean military honor guard and enter the Peace House.\n\nPhoto\n\n[The Korean leaders\u2019 meeting was a carefully choreographed dance, with a surprise step. Read more here.]\n\n\u201cI came here to put an end to the history of confrontation,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as saying during the meeting, according to Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, Yoon Young-chan. Mr. Moon suggested they hold more meetings, and Mr. Kim said he would visit South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House \u201cif the president invites me.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Moon\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim on Friday \u2014 their first face-to-face talk \u2014 is rich with symbolism, Mr. Kim is not expected to capitulate on Mr. Trump\u2019s key demand: total and immediate nuclear disarmament.\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s other challenge, with Mr. Trump, turns on how best to deal with North Korea and its leader \u2014 who is expected to meet with Mr. Trump in the next few months.\n\nThe South Korean president favors an \u201caction for action\u201d strategy in which the North takes steps to dismantle its nuclear arsenal and is rewarded for each move with economic benefits and security guarantees. South Korean officials said that the entire process could take about two years.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s national security team, by contrast, has insisted that North Korea must scrap its weapons programs before any relief from the sanctions that isolate the nation can be granted. And they say that \u201csubstantial dismantlement\u201d should be completed much more quickly, perhaps in six months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moon sees himself less as a negotiator with Mr. Kim and more as a mediator shuttling between two men who believe that keeping others guessing gives them an edge: a volatile American president with no experience in nuclear negotiations, and a hotheaded young North Korean leader with no experience on a global stage.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat we can do is to try to help the North and the United States reach an agreement, helping them narrow their differences and seeking and presenting practical ideas both sides can accept,\u201d Mr. Moon said recently, adding that he may have only one shot to get it right. \u201cThis is an opportunity that will not come again.\u201d\n\nThe challenge is stark. No nation that has openly tested a nuclear device has ever surrendered its arsenal, and North Korea has conducted six underground explosions, each more powerful than the last, and has test-fired missiles that can reach the mainland United States.\n\nBut Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have both already defied conventional wisdom about what is possible. If they meet in June \u2014 most likely in Singapore, according to American and South Korean officials \u2014 it would be the first direct encounter between the leaders of the two nations, as well as a chance to test the argument that making progress with North Korea in the nuclear standoff requires starting at the top.\n\nThe meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon is the third summit meeting between leaders of the two countries, but the first in which denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula tops the agenda.\n\n\u201cI hope we can have open-minded talks on issues of concern and produce good results, not the kind of results we saw in the past that were not implemented and made us start from scratch again,\u201d Mr. Kim said as the talks began on Friday. For his part, Mr. Moon said he hoped that the two leaders could engage in \u201cbroad-minded\u201d discussions and produce \u201ca big gift\u201d for those yearning for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nMr. Moon hopes to emerge from Friday\u2019s summit meeting with a formal but vague denuclearization commitment from Mr. Kim and perhaps a path to negotiating a peace treaty or a plan to reduce military tensions. Some have suggested a pullback of troops from the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is possible.\n\nBut Mr. Moon has acknowledged that there is a limit to what the two Koreas can agree on without American involvement. \u201cPeace on the Korean Peninsula cannot be achieved by agreements between South and North Korea alone,\u201d he said last month. \u201cIt has to have American endorsement.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne measure of success will be whether Mr. Moon can persuade Mr. Kim to set a timetable for denuclearization in his talks with Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cConfirming a willingness to denuclearize is not enough. What matters is an agreement on by when the North will denuclearize,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute, a South Korean think tank.\n\nSome who have tried and failed to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program worry that Mr. Trump, having threatened the North with nuclear annihilation, has now swung too far to the other side and may be too eager to make a deal. Having derided Mr. Kim previously as \u201cLittle Rocket Man,\u201d Mr. Trump described the North Korean leader as \u201cvery honorable\u201d this week.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cI find it impossible to believe that Kim is prepared to give up what his father and his grandfather bequeathed to him,\u201d said Gary Samore, a veteran of negotiations with North Korea as the top arms control aide in the Clinton and Obama administrations, speaking at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\n\nBut he added that Mr. Kim \u201cmay now calculate he has enough of a nuclear arsenal\u201d \u2014 and so can afford to put more on the table than in the past.\n\nOne possibility that causes consternation in the region is that Mr. Trump will settle for dismantling North Korea\u2019s small fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles, eliminating its ability to strike the United States \u2014 but leaving South Korea and Japan vulnerable. \u201cIt would be the \u2018America First\u2019 way,\u201d Mr. Samore said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\nIf skepticism is rampant in Washington, the Moon administration is somewhat more optimistic. To South Korean policymakers, Mr. Kim\u2019s recent decisions suggest that he is willing to trade his nuclear arsenal for economic growth, which the young leader may see as necessary to preserving his rule for decades. They also argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats of military action have proved more effective at changing Mr. Kim\u2019s calculations than anticipated.\n\nPhoto\n\nSouth Korean officials say they have spent far more time and energy coordinating with the Trump administration before the Friday summit meeting than with the North Koreans, an effort complicated by the White House shake-up that included the departure of Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster as national security adviser and the firing of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state.\n\nThe focus on Washington also reflects concern about General McMaster\u2019s successor, John R. Bolton, who joined the administration after arguing for military strikes to destroy North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, ridiculing South Korean leaders as \u201cputty in North Korea\u2019s hands,\u201d and calling North Koreans \u201cthe biggest con men in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, described Mr. Bolton as an \u201chonest broker\u201d after their first meeting this month, and he traveled again to Washington this week for further discussions with Mr. Bolton.\n\nOne mystery is what, if any, progress was made in a secret meeting in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital, this month between Mr. Kim and Mike Pompeo, the former C.I.A. director who was confirmed Thursday as secretary of state. Mr. Trump said Thursday that Mr. Pompeo was not scheduled to see Mr. Kim but had \u201ca great meeting\u201d that lasted more than an hour.\n\nThough Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump have outlined different approaches to negotiating with North Korea, they agree on the need to avoid the pitfalls that doomed previous rounds of talks.\n\nOne area of consensus is an attempt to more clearly establish the talks\u2019 desired outcome from the outset, giving all parties greater incentive to move forward. Previous negotiations were open-ended, without specific goals that everyone agreed on.\n\nSouth Korea and the United States also want to push the North to accept a timetable that would move quickly from the suspension of weapons tests \u2014 which it announced last week \u2014 to the dismantlement of its nuclear program. Some in the Trump administration have argued for completion in six months, but that may be an opening negotiating position given the challenges involved.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bolton has occasionally cited the example of Libya, which shipped most of its nuclear equipment to an American weapons lab in Tennessee over the course of several weeks in late 2003. But much of that equipment was still in crates; there was little to dismantle.\n\nIran took a bit more than six months to take apart much of its program and ship 97 percent of its nuclear material from the country. But, like Libya, it had not yet built nuclear weapons.\n\nNorth Korea is believed to have 20 to 60 such weapons \u2014 American intelligence agencies cannot agree on the number \u2014 in addition to a vast infrastructure of fuel production and weapons manufacturing facilities, much of it hidden in the mountains or underground. Mr. Samore argued that the North should be asked to hand over an inventory that the United States and its allies could compare with intelligence reports and seek to verify. That process would offer a first sign of whether Mr. Kim is coming clean, but could take years to complete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI do not know of any way of unilaterally verifying an agreement whereby North Korea gives up its nuclear arsenal,\u201d said William J. Perry, a former defense secretary. \u201cWe do not know how many nuclear weapons North Korea has operational or under construction. We do not know where all of their nuclear facilities are located.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s aides have argued that it is unrealistic to expect North Korea to simply surrender its arsenal without an \u201caction for action\u201d process that offers immediate benefits and builds trust. Early steps by the North could include the dismantlement of missile production facilities and allowing the return of international inspectors to nuclear sites, while the United States could begin normalizing diplomatic relations and easing some sanctions, like those that primarily affect North Korea\u2019s population rather than officials, analysts say.\n\nMr. Kim has also endorsed \u201cphased, synchronized steps\u201d toward denuclearization.\n\nBut White House officials have repeatedly rejected the incremental approach, saying past administrations have tried it without success.\n\nThere have been hints of friction between the Trump administration and Mr. Moon\u2019s team over the issue, with local news outlets in South Korea reporting that Mr. Bolton had pressed Seoul \u201cnot to move too far ahead\u201d in its talks with Mr. Kim.

Talks to end the 1950-53 Korean War would require negotiations involving the main combatants: North and South Korea, China and the United States.\n\nIn Japan, there was caution about the lack of specifics in the inter-Korean accord. The document fell far short of the Trump administration\u2019s demands for the dismantlement of the North\u2019s arsenal and of the need for inspections to verify that the weapons no longer existed, officials and commentators said.\n\nThe Japanese foreign minister, Taro Kono, called for North Korea to take \u201cconcrete actions for the dismantlement of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical weapons, and ballistic missiles of all ranges in a complete and irreversible manner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnalysts in the Japanese news media also expressed doubts that Friday\u2019s meeting was more than symbolic.\n\n\u201cHarmony was fully shown, but it\u2019s a big mistake to interpret that there was big progress substantially,\u201d an editorial in the right-leaning newspaper Sankei said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s very doubtful that the \u2018denuclearization\u2019 mentioned in the joint statement matches what has been discussed between Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Abe, who has strained relations with South Korea, implied that the new accord may not be too different from a similar commitment in 2007 between a previous South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, and Kim Jong-il, the father of the current North Korean leader. That accord fell apart soon after it was signed.\n\n\u201cWe would like to think about how we respond to the current statement, analyzing and comparing it with the past statement,\u201d Mr. Abe said.\n\nOf all the North\u2019s neighbors, Japan is perhaps the most uneasy about the process that began at the inter-Korean summit meeting. It fears Washington could agree to trade away the North\u2019s long-range intercontinental missiles that can hit the United States, but allow Pyongyang to keep its medium-range missiles, leaving Japan vulnerable.\n\nMr. Abe went out of his way to remind reporters that he had spent 11 hours with Mr. Trump this month, insisting his proximity to the American president meant he had not been left out of the negotiations over North Korea.\n\nOn Saturday morning, President Trump wrote in a Twitter post that he \u201cjust had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea,\u201d and added that he had also spoken with Mr. Abe \u201cto inform him of the ongoing negotiations.\u201d\n\nIn China, the state-run news media, which generally reflects the attitudes of the government, stressed the need for the United States to quickly enter the picture and seal the deal made between South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, and Mr. Kim.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Kim-Moon summit will write the goal of denuclearization and strive to end the state of war in the Declaration of Panmunjom,\u201d one Chinese newspaper, the Global Times, said in an editorial. \u201cBut they are all writing about the vision rather than the exact plan.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCheng Xiaohe, a professor of international relations at Renmin University, said it was too much to expect the two Korean leaders to come up with a definitive prescription for ending the North\u2019s nuclear program in just one day.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un has to leave some gifts for Trump,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cThis summit got a lot of results for an inter-Korean meeting.\u201d\n\nBut there was no question that China remained sidelined in the rapprochement between North and South, and it was nowhere to be seen in the prelude to the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, said Shen Zhihua, a prominent Chinese historian who has written extensively on North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s goal was to keep its nuclear weapons and to be recognized as a nuclear power, Mr. Shen said in an interview broadcast by Voice of America.\n\nIn the end, the North could persuade other countries to let it keep its nuclear arsenal, or at least part of it. And in the process, Mr. Shen said, China could be left permanently on the outside \u2014 with North Korea leaning toward the United States.\n\n\u201cMany Chinese people are very optimistic now,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cIt does not seem that simple. If North Korea holds a nuclear weapon, it will not hit South Korea. Will it hit Japan? It does not dare. It also will not dare to fight the United States. If you look at history, North Korea is not sure about China and has a mind of revenge toward China.\u201d\n\nIn addition, families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean spies four decades ago had hoped that Mr. Moon would raise the issue in his meeting with Mr. Kim. That seemed a distant hope. Human rights activists who asked Mr. Moon to get commitments from Mr. Kim on reforming the North\u2019s vicious prison system were also disappointed.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in front of his home in Saitama, a suburb of Tokyo, Shigeo Iizuka, a brother of Yaeko Taguchi, one of the kidnapped, said that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the abductions were not mentioned in the joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe summit meeting, Mr. Iizuka said, \u201cwas a big event that will be remembered as a page of history.

And talking about denuclearizing is hardly new. The North promised the same in a 1992 agreement, and many in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, wondered then if the nightmare of living under the constant threat of artillery barrage was about to end. In fact, the agreement reached on Friday picks up language from the 1992 accord, and has similar provisions about reuniting families separated during the Korean War and nonaggression agreements. Little of it happened.\n\nThere were two agreements with the George W. Bush administration, each described at the time as breakthroughs. Since then the North has amassed 20 to 60 nuclear weapons, up from zero when those commitments were made.\n\nNo one knows those numbers better than Mr. Pompeo, who spent a lot of time with the C.I.A.\u2019s Korea Mission unit, assessing the scope and imminence of its nuclear capabilities. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history here, where promises have been made, hopes have been raised and then dashed,\u201d the new secretary of state told reporters.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s solution to not getting \u201cplayed,\u201d the phrase he so often uses about his predecessors and North Korea, is to keep what he calls a \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d on the North until denuclearization happens. The South Koreans say they agree. But the documents issued Friday hint at benefits that begin to flow to the North as they move toward a peace agreement, and a reduction of tensions.\n\nChina, which is largely interested in maintaining the status quo, could also loosen the restrictions on oil and goods, as long as negotiations play out.\n\nAll this suggests that Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge when he meets Mr. Kim, probably in early June, is growing. He must establish the process for the actual dismantlement of weapons, the removal of stockpiled uranium and plutonium bomb fuel from the country and a verification program that will be one of the most complex in history, given the vastness of North Korea\u2019s mountains.", "title": "Koreans Set the Table for a Deal That Trump Will Try to Close", "authors": []}

Those would be major challenges to deal with in negotiations and not at all what the Trump administration has in mind.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Kim is evidently serious about trying to raise the living standards of his impoverished country and is prepared to use his nuclear weapons as barter to lift onerous economic sanctions and obtain American assurances that would allow his regime to continue.\n\nNot long before he was brought in as the new national security adviser, John Bolton, told an interviewer that a Trump-Kim summit meeting would inevitably fail, which, he said, would clear the way to the next phase \u2014 presumably a pre-emptive strike.\n\nThat in itself is reason to hope that new opening in the long-running confrontation of North and South Korea so dramatically staged at Panmunjom does confound expectations and lead to real and fruitful negotiations, not just between the two Koreas but also between the United States and North Korea. The success of that meeting puts pressure on Mr. Trump to continue the momentum toward peace by patiently pursuing serious negotiations with North Korea, not making unilateral demands and issuing threats.

Before then, Mr. Kushner was known mainly as a developer of garden apartments in New Jersey, where he lived, and a major Democratic Party contributor.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue building was meant to signal a significant change in direction for the Kushners, who moved into Manhattan, installed the family headquarters on the building\u2019s 15th floor and went on a real estate shopping spree that has left them with properties in Brooklyn, Jersey City and Maryland.\n\nBut 666 Fifth was bought mostly with borrowed money.

In those days, go-go dancers stood on a ledge above the dance floor and demonstrated the latest dances. I was really good at it. Go-go dancing was where my spirit of dance came alive. I became more interested in choreographing because there was no other place I could dance where I felt that free.\n\nDid you always think of yourself as a choreographer?\n\nI made up my first dance when I was about 3. I first heard the word \u201cchoreography\u201d as a child in a movie theater with my parents.

But they frequently choose the GRE because it can be used to apply to graduate and business schools as well as some law schools.\n\nSo far, Arizona has enrolled 25 students \u2014 12 in the first year and 13 in the second year \u2014 who applied on the basis of their GRE scores. It is too early to tell how they will fare because the first group of students will not take their state licensing exams until next year \u2014 after they receive their degrees.\n\nMr. Miller said the students \u201care randomly distributed around the classes, which have around 80 people each, and their performance is well within what we normally see.\u201d\n\nIn the first group, he said, many seemed to avoid saying they had taken only the GRE. \u201cBut by the second class, no one was the least bit worried to say so.\u201d\n\nMr. Holm, who has been a teacher, nonprofit executive and a budget official, said he was never asked about what test he took.\n\n\u201cIt was hard enough being the first,\u201d recalled Mr. Holm, about his early law student days, \u201cbut I was mindful that there was a stigma that someone might not be qualified enough.\u201d", "title": "Law Schools Debate a Contentious Testing Alternative", "authors": ["Elizabeth Olson"]}

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, the deputy director of impact litigation for the Bronx Defenders, said that allowing the police to handle sealed records unchecked undermines efforts in New York City to promote fairness and limit unnecessary harm in the criminal justice system. A court ruling, she said, is needed to remind the Police Department of its obligation under state law.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a push in New York to get people disentangled from the criminal justice system for crimes of poverty like jumping a turnstile,\u201d she said, \u201cand the N.Y.P.D. is overriding it based on sealed arrests that, under longstanding privacy rules, are supposed to not be used in any way, particularly in ways that continue to harm people when they\u2019ve already had their cases dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe sealing statutes curtail access to official records of sealed cases \u2014 except for published court decisions or opinions, or records and briefs on appeal \u2014 for people other than the accused and for public and private agencies. The laws also require fingerprints and photos in the files to be destroyed or returned to the accused.\n\nBut the statutes do not conceal the records completely and forever: Lawmakers carved out several exceptions for access, including for law enforcement agencies to get permission from a court.\n\nNick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city Law Department, said the agency would \u201creview the lawsuit and respond in the litigation.\u201d The city has 60 days to do so.\n\nThe Police Department declined to comment. But the case cites a memorandum from a federal lawsuit over dismissed summonses that the city settled for $75 million last year. In it, city lawyers said the Police Department uses sealed arrest data for a variety of reasons, including to solve crimes and apprehend suspects.\n\nJeffrey A. Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School who testified against the city in litigation over its stop-and-frisk tactics, said that claim appears to never have been challenged. \u201cAbsent some showing of some statutory authorization to contravene the statute, then the plaintiffs seem to have a pretty strong claim,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe outcome of the lawsuit could affect millions of case files. Just between 2014 and 2016, as the police scaled back stop-and-frisk, over 400,000 cases were supposed to be sealed, according to the complaint. Almost 83 percent, or 330,000 cases, involved black and Latino defendants, who are more likely to live in communities where police activity is highest and for whom being arrested can have a detrimental impact on their employment, housing, immigration status and eligibility for public benefits.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Most states have laws requiring some criminal cases to be expunged or sealed, but compliance varies, observers say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sharing data across their networks, and this introduces just a more vast and fast dissemination of personal information than existed 10 years ago or before that,\u201d Ms. Borchetta said. \u201cThese technologies represent great advancements in law enforcement but they also create new privacy concerns.\u201d\n\nEugene O\u2019Donnell, a former city police officer who now teaches at John Jay College, said the information contained in arrest reports is indispensable to investigators because it can help them track patterns, determine affiliations and examine particular crime spikes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a treasure trove of information for investigators, whether you\u2019re talking about street crime, terrorism or more sophisticated investigations,\u201d said Professor O\u2019Donnell, who was also a prosecutor in Brooklyn and Queens. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you want to put out of your reach.\u201d\n\nEven though a sealed case did not result in a conviction, he said, that does not always mean a person did not commit a crime or other egregious act.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hire someone for a position of trust, do you want to be blind to that or see what was on file?\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very clear cases where someone got away with a very serious crime for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNarrow exceptions in the sealing statutes allow access to someone\u2019s sealed case records for prosecutors, parole and corrections agencies, gun licensing authorities, and employers that hire peace officers and police officers. For instance, prosecutors may see the sealed records of someone to whom they are considering offering a deal to dismiss a subsequent case if the person stays out of trouble for a certain period of time. In another example, police departments are permitted to access the sealed arrest records of people who apply to become officers.\n\nBut the process for the police to obtain a court order for individuals\u2019 records can be burdensome, Professor O\u2019Donnell said, and the lawsuit could spur the Legislature to amend the statutes, which lawmakers expanded last year to include nonviolent criminal convictions more than 10 years old. Or, he said, it might prompt a streamlining of the process to obtain court approval for sealed records, much as the process for getting warrants has been simplified.\n\nThe Police Department\u2019s use of sealed records has attracted a legal challenge before, and it agreed to scrub that kind of information from a database of street stops as part of a settlement with the New York Civil Liberties Union in 2013.\n\nThe Police Department handbook for detectives details how to request a court order to unseal photos and court records, but it also outlines a process for investigators to obtain an authorization code to access sealed arrest records without court approval. And, according to the lawsuit, the sealed arrests also appear on the rap sheets that patrol officers consult during street stops to decide whether to make an arrest or issue a violation for minor infractions.\n\nPolice officials often anonymously reveal information about sealed arrests to the media in big cases like fatal police shootings. But defense lawyers say the practice is also common in everyday cases that do not capture the spotlight.\n\nIn interviews, public defenders said they often found sealed records in police documents turned over by prosecutors, or evidence suggesting they have been used, such as a phone number from a sealed file or video of detectives interrogating their clients about sealed cases.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, identified as R.C., was living and working in Wappinger Falls, N.Y., when he was arrested in connection with an April 2015 robbery in the Bronx. R.C.\u2019s picture had been used in three photo arrays shown to the victim, who finally chose it two weeks after the incident. But the image the police used was from a 2011 arrest that was sealed, and therefore required to be destroyed or returned to R.C., according to the complaint.\n\nFriends told investigators that R.C. had stayed in Danbury, Conn., on the night of the robbery, and prosecutors ultimately dropped the case in November 2016. But, the complaint said, commuting for his 10 court appearances cost R.C. his job and the experience left him scarred.", "title": "Lawsuit Challenges Police Use of Sealed Arrest Records", "authors": ["Ashley Southall"]}

Populist or pragmatist? Establishment or insurgent? But in the race between Mr. Cordray and Mr. Kucinich \u2014 one of the year\u2019s most closely watched Democratic primaries \u2014 a more basic tension has consumed the collective left: Who has the truest claim to progressivism in 2018, when both candidates can credibly grab at the label? Is it better to be liberal on guns (Mr. Kucinich) or the bane of the banks (Mr. Cordray)? To be a fire-breather or a bit of a square?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no stigma in being competent,\u201d said Kevin Davis, 63, of Akron, a Cordray supporter and fund-raiser who has gravitated toward the candidate\u2019s work-within-the-system defense of responsive government. \u201cDennis just promises everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be pulled into the vortex of Dennis Kucinich,\u201d said Nina Turner, a former state senator and the president of Our Revolution, a group that was formed out of Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign and that has endorsed Mr. Kucinich. \u201cHe\u2019s infectious.\u201d\n\nAs Democrats look to reclaim a purple state shading red, recent history suggests a slog. Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight points. It has a Republican-controlled legislature and has had a Republican governor for all but four years since 1991. But the prospect of a Democrat-friendly election year and a whiff of scandal in Columbus \u2014 where the House speaker resigned this month as federal investigators questioned his conduct \u2014 has convinced strategists that even a proudly liberal candidate could win in November.\n\nThe Democratic primary has also doubled as an early proxy test for supporters of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, two possible presidential candidates in 2020, and a peek at precisely what kind of figure can speak to today\u2019s party base in a Midwestern bellwether.\n\nMr. Cordray, 58, a former state attorney general before his time in Washington, has campaigned with Ms. Warren, who devised the bank-regulating agency he oversaw under President Barack Obama. He is leaning heavily on support from labor groups like the Ohio Federation of Teachers and the Ohio A.F.L.-C.I.O., specking public appearances with protect-the-little-guy anecdotes from his watchdog role in the hope that voters will not mistake boring for moderate.\n\nThere is talk of task forces and pension protections, of government \u201cbeing a force for good\u201d again. He can appear most animated condemning an \u201congoing war on local communities\u201d from budget-slashing state officials.

Mr. Kucinich has emerged as the most persistent threat to Mr. Cordray, the presumed favorite, spooking party officials who fear Mr. Kucinich would stand little chance in the fall. Primary polling has been inconsistent: One recent survey showed the race effectively tied; another gave Mr. Cordray a double-digit edge, though more than half of respondents were undecided.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has also built a nascent following awakened to his politics since Mr. Sanders\u2019s run.\n\nMr. Sanders himself has not endorsed Mr. Kucinich. \u201cDennis is his own man,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with journalists from The New York Times, calling him an old friend. \u201cDennis is a very \u2014 what\u2019s the word? \u2014 unusual politician.\u201d\n\nBut Our Revolution, the Sanders-aligned group, has held up Mr. Kucinich as a kind of progressive seer, who pushed ideas like tuition-free college long before they came into wider fashion, rallying behind the storm-the-castle populism familiar to admirers of both men.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Kucinich rejected any suggestion that this is a race between two generally analogous progressives on policy. He described himself, unsubtly, as a leader \u201cfor a couple of decades\u201d on issues like single-payer health care. And since the Parkland, Fla., massacre in February, he has made gun safety central to his campaign, repeatedly reminding voters of Mr. Cordray\u2019s past \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association and his refusal to embrace an assault weapons ban.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf there was indeed truth-in-labeling in elections, Richard Cordray would be running as a Republican,\u201d Mr. Kucinich said.\n\nAt a recent candidate forum, he affixed an \u201cF\u201d pin to his lapel to signal his own N.R.A. grade. Mr. Kucinich\u2019s wife, Elizabeth, three decades younger than her husband and six inches taller, mouthed instructions from the front row while filming him.

Kasich, a term-limited Republican. The leading Republican candidates are Mike DeWine, the state attorney general, and Mary Taylor, the lieutenant governor.)\n\nYet Mr. Kucinich, more than most Democrats, has run afoul of perceived liberal doctrine himself through the years.\n\nHe once opposed abortion rights. He has echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot. And he has reported receiving $20,000 for a speech from a group sympathetic to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whom Mr. Kucinich has traveled to see. (Mr. Kucinich, who has since promised to return the money, said in the interview that he always met with leaders \u201cin the cause of peace\u201d and did not answer directly when asked if Mr. Assad was a bad actor.)\n\nIn conversations with voters, many framed their preferences as a matter of temperament as much as vision. \u201cHe\u2019s not a hell-raiser,\u201d Matt Rado, 34, said of Mr. Cordray, for whom he plans to vote anyway. \u201cIt would be nice to see some more passion.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven playful flourishes from Mr. Cordray seem intended to evoke a certain hyper-diligence. His campaign literature cites his five \u201cJeopardy\u201d championships in the 1980s. In a past race, he rewarded dedicated volunteers with DVD copies of his triumph.\n\nHe is said to enjoy a good parade \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve always been a parade-ophile,\u201d he allowed \u2014 and recently demonstrated his levity to a reporter by pledging to squeeze himself down a children\u2019s slide at a Canton playground after a speech to ironworkers. He kept his word against the advice of a press aide.\n\n\u201cThe buttoned-down world of the federal financial regulators is very different,\u201d Mr. Cordray said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s more emotion in this.

{"date": "2018-04-14 00:00:00", "text": "The arrival of an abortion bill in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Argentina\u2019s Congress, is widely seen as a direct outgrowth of a broader women\u2019s rights movement in the country that started in 2015 with a campaign against femicides called \u201cNi Una Menos,\u201d \u201cNot One Less.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of women have taken to the streets in recent years to raise awareness about domestic violence and press for stronger laws to protect women.\n\n\u201cThe Ni Una Menos movement led to a surge of adherence to the feminist movement and a generalized demand for more equal rights,\u201d said Dora Barrancos, 77, a sociologist at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council, a government agency. \u201cThis change is very overwhelming.\u201d\n\nFor Andrea Schenk, 28, who joined the abortion rights demonstrators outside Congress, the link between Ni Una Menos and the abortion debate unfolding among lawmakers is undeniable.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFighting against femicides led us to fight against all forms of violence against women \u2014 and not letting us decide over our bodies is a form of violence,\u201d she said.\n\nThe prospect of legalization became more politically plausible earlier this year, when President Mauricio Macri, who opposes legalizing abortion, freed allied lawmakers to \u201cvote their conscience\u201d on the issue.\n\nIf the bill does pass \u2014 by no means certain \u2014 it would be, in part, because of a coalition of unlikely allies in Argentina\u2019s notoriously divided Congress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rise in activism among the country\u2019s women encouraged a few female lawmakers who support legalizing abortion to join forces. They include Victoria Donda, a leftist; Brenda Austin, from Mr. Macri\u2019s center-right Cambiemos coalition; Romina del Pl\u00e1, from the Workers\u2019 Party; and M\u00f3nica Macha, an ally of the center-left former president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have lots of political differences, we also have a profound agreement on this issue,\u201d Ms. Macha said.\n\nHundreds of experts and witnesses are scheduled to appear before a special commission that will meet twice a week over the next two months to consider the bill.\n\nSeveral countries in Latin America allow abortions under limited circumstances, like pregnancy that results from rape or when the mother\u2019s life is threatened. Argentina would become the fourth nation in the region to allow abortion without such restrictions, if the procedure were to be legalized, joining Cuba, Uruguay, Guyana and some parts of Mexico.\n\nProponents of legalization in Argentina say their main motivation is to save lives. Complications from clandestine abortions account for 18 percent of maternal deaths in the country, making it the leading cause, said Mariana Romero, a researcher at the Center for the Study of the State and Society, a nonprofit organization. In 2016 and 2015, at least 98 women died as a result of botched abortions.\n\n\u201cThere are between 45,000 to 60,000 hospitalizations derived from clandestine abortions every year,\u201d said Ms. Austin, the lawmaker from the president\u2019s coalition. \u201cThose who are against legal abortion are in favor of clandestine abortions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough women who have been raped or have potentially lethal pregnancy complications are allowed to have abortions in Argentina, few doctors perform the procedure because they are afraid of running afoul of the law.\n\n\u201cIn practice those exceptions are not actually honored, and what we see is a near total ban on abortions,\u201d said Salil Shetty, the secretary general of Amnesty International, who visited the country this past week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSupport for legalizing abortion appears to have grown in Argentina in recent years as the Roman Catholic Church has lost clout.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She wanted a sliver of the authenticating chaos all to herself; she got it, and more.\n\nIn \u201cThe Recovering,\u201d Jamison\u2019s story is braided with the larger story of addiction in America. We read about Nixon\u2019s war on drugs and about narcotics prisons. Theorists, clinicians and neuropharmacologists are cited. The career arcs of artist-drinkers like Berryman, Jean Rhys and Billie Holiday are traced.\n\nThis material has been hashed over many times in previous books, and in the first half of \u201cThe Recovering\u201d Jamison brings little that\u2019s new to this discussion. You frequently feel you\u2019re reading filler; mental sawdust.\n\nThe first half is off-putting in other ways. Jamison is close to humorless as a writer, and she rubs and rubs our noses in her bad-girl bona fides. Every lily is painted, black. She performs a down-and-out version of what the essayist and critic Logan Pearsall Smith called a \u201cswimgloat,\u201d a triumphal glide through society.\n\nThe two aspects of this memoir don\u2019t mix particularly well.

Sixty million people spent $10 billion there in 2017, bewildering figures that only begin to make sense once you\u2019ve clicked through 17 pages of direct-from-Guangdong cocktail shakers. AliExpress has just about every product you could imagine, and plenty you probably couldn\u2019t, presented in no particular order.

Nearby, I could hear my husband, Teddy, scrabbling about in his own coffin, testing to see if his lid was sealed securely (from the sound of it: yes). The air smelled like a warm shoe. Teddy shouted my name, and I shouted back. Entombment did nothing to dull our communication skills. Which, I suppose, would be comforting if I believed in the afterlife.\n\nThe coffins were part of an escape game called \u201cBoxed Up,\u201d hosted by a venue in Brooklyn that offers a variety of such amusements. Escape games work like this: You enter a room (or coffin) and are given a limited amount of time to find your way out by solving puzzles and clues planted within. It\u2019s basically the \u201990s computer game Myst, but in real life. Escape games come in all sorts of themes, most with a cinematic flair: crypt, haunted hotel, underground bunker, spaceship, sanitarium, zombie apocalypse, archaeological dig. In Detroit, there\u2019s one designed to resemble a 1980s rec room; if you don\u2019t get out, the promotional materials warn, you\u2019ll be stuck playing Atari forever. Another, in Kansas City, is set inside the Truman presidential campaign.\n\nLike dreams and traffic disputes, escape rooms are scandalously dull to summarize. But try it once, and everything else will suddenly pale in comparison. You\u2019ll see. A perfectly nice friend will text to see if you want to grab a drink, and you\u2019ll be thinking: You want to sip a beverage and chat when we could be jimmying open an armoire that contains a bloody doll with an anagram carved into her left foot that we have to chant three times holding hands before an amulet falls from the ceiling? Please!\n\nGenerally, the games begin with an employee gathering you and your friends at a door to give you a spiel. (\u201cPlease do not use physical force to escape.\u201d) Then a clock starts, and you start looking for puzzles: hidden compartments, trick mirrors, two-way radios, carpets woven with concealed messages. (The hard part isn\u2019t solving the puzzles; it\u2019s figuring out what is a puzzle. One time I wasted eight minutes examining a bowl of plastic vegetables that turned out to be d\u00e9cor.) Each puzzle leads to the next, which eventually leads to a key to unlock the door.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThink of all the ways you already insert pleasurable, circumscribed bursts of risk into your life. Maybe you watch horror movies, consume hot sauce, jaywalk. Maybe you pursue casual sex or steal Splenda packets from Starbucks or treat the speed limit as a cute suggestion. An escape game is like stacking these things atop one another and rounding out the itinerary with a medium-scary roller coaster. The panic is real even if the pressure is an illusion. You won\u2019t die or get stuck in the 1980s if you fail to escape; an employee will simply unlatch the door and let you out with a \u201cBetter luck next time.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For our bout of endangerment in the coffins, my husband and I paid little more than the price of a fussy restaurant dinner. We weren\u2019t totally unsupervised; an employee of the venue listened through hidden microphones to offer hints and intervene if something disastrous happened. But still.

He was visiting from San Francisco, and as we sat in the white-brick backyard of a bar, he urged me to disclose my location to him on Find My Friends, a function that Apple began quietly placing on all iPhones in 2015. In a world where we use social media to broadcast highly curated versions of ourselves, the app offers a frightening antithesis: to tell the people in our lives, via a small orange dot moving across a map, exactly where we are at all times. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d Jeff asked me, giggling and snapping his gum like some teenage villain.\n\nAt first I objected to Jeff\u2019s challenge with profanity. But then I asked myself why. What was I hiding? He lived across the country, so at the very least the app couldn\u2019t make our friendship worse. It wouldn\u2019t keep me from the sort of white lies that keep society lubricated: I\u2019m going to turn in early, but have fun at the party, we say, even if what we really mean is, I need company but not yours, or There\u2019s a walk I\u2019d like to take alone, a book I\u2019d rather read. Jeff is something like a sibling to me, the sort of friend who offers a ride to a faraway doctor\u2019s appointment, then spends the ride gleefully mocking my haircut. Relenting to his taunt, I pulled out my phone and pressed a button that posed a terrifying question: Share location indefinitely?\n\nIn the next few weeks, I was more in touch with Jeff than I had been in the half-decade since I left California. During his visit, we\u2019d spoken about all the hiking I wasn\u2019t doing and all the hiking that he was, so I took the opportunity, when I saw him stuck in gridlock traffic on the freeway at the foot of Potrero Hill, to text: \u201cHow\u2019re those great outdoors treating you, bud?\u201d During a week when I had dodged a call, claiming the careerist busyness of a New Yorker, he caught me strolling through Central Park at 3 on a Tuesday, and he volleyed back. Sometime in July, Jeff and his wife, Evyan, went up to the Russian River, where as a kid I learned to swim crosscurrent. It\u2019s a place I dream of often, and when I saw him there, I wrote to say that I missed them, missed the river. \u201cSend a picture,\u201d I wrote, and he did.

The same holds true for most so-called \u201cprestige\u201d television, from the violent, misogynist dystopia of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d to the violent, misogynist dystopia of \u201cWestworld.\u201d They feel inevitable and manipulative, and watching them does nothing but intensify my already simmering anxieties \u2014 which I suspect is the point. So nowadays, when the kitchen is clean and the cats are fed and my brain is on its downward spiral toward sleep, all I want to do is sink into the couch and turn on \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d a show about a specific kind of darkness I have complete control in avoiding. It provides all the thrill of a dystopian hellscape with none of the fear.\n\n\u201cHouse Hunters\u201d is on HGTV, a channel whose mission is to make all Americans not only want to own a home but also to be perpetually dissatisfied with it once they do. Over the past decade, the network\u2019s slate of personality-driven home-improvement shows \u2014 \u201cProperty Brothers,\u201d \u201cFlip or Flop\u201d and \u201cFixer Upper\u201d \u2014 has made it the ninth-most-popular channel on basic cable. The faces of these shows are on morning shows and lifestyle brands and the covers of tabloid magazines. But \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d which has been broadcast since 1999, remains its purest, most magnetic property.\n\nInstead of a host yearning for celebrity, there is only a soothing, nameless narrator who functions as a Greek chorus to support the rotating cast of laymen who populate the screen. Each episode follows a tidy formula: Potential home buyers, usually a couple, tour and critique three homes (and, inevitably, each other) while a real estate agent looks on. By the end of each episode, they decide on one of the three and put in an offer; a home, any home, is always purchased \u2014 that\u2019s the point. Suddenly, through the magic of video editing, the homeowners\u2019 things materialize, and the show fades to black before the home has the chance to disappoint its new occupants. Every episode I\u2019ve seen (there are nearly 2,000) is a thrilling cultural artifact, a tiny parable about the way we romanticize the stresses of modern American life and pile on more in hopes of assuaging those festering below.\n\nRecently I watched a young couple look for their first home in Cincinnati. Matt, a dapper toothpaste salesman, and his wife, Kim, a soft-spoken physical therapist, seemed helplessly in love with each other, but the hunt quickly turned passive-aggressive. He wanted a move-in-ready Craftsman or a Cape Cod; she wanted a historic Victorian that begged for renovations. He set the max at $400,000, but she felt they could spend more. With every opened door \u2014 and the host of surprises behind each \u2014 they were reminded that no house could possibly compare with whatever each of them had imagined. Eventually they settled on something neither really wanted in the first place: a Craftsman for $389,900 that needed a new kitchen and substantial cosmetic improvements to nearly every room. In the final sequence, we see Matt applying a layer of paint to an old door frame. \u201cSure happy we bought a house that requires all this work,\u201d he says, a hint of sadness in his voice.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018House Hunters\u2019", "authors": []}

At the end, however, she seriously mischaracterizes my views on Erasmus. She writes that I \u201comitted Erasmus\u2019s strongest lines\u201d in his dialogue with Luther on free will and thus failed to make clear that Erasmus doubted \u201cLuther\u2019s absolute rule of faith\u201d and was \u201cjustifiably skeptical of a self-verifying criterion for truth that can generate the kind of knowledge Luther claimed for himself.\u201d In fact, I spend several pages describing and quoting from Erasmus\u2019s text. I note that he considered free will \u201cone of many abstract matters in the Bible\u201d whose meaning \u201cremained elusive and about which he would consider himself a skeptic if the church allowed it.\u201d While Goldstein states that my book presents Erasmus as a \u201cself-protective pragmatist,\u201d I actually emphasize his principled opposition to Luther\u2019s dogmatism, his exasperation with Luther\u2019s \u201cpassing off his own interpretation of the Bible as God\u2019s Word\u201d and his embrace of pluralism and concord. Goldstein also writes that I consider Erasmus\u2019s influence on today\u2019s world \u201cfaint.\u201d Yet I devote an entire chapter to showing how his humanist ideals (and his support for a united, borderless Europe), which were suppressed or forgotten for centuries after his death, were revived after World War II, becoming a foundation for the European Union.

And while there is no \u201csettled science\u201d of depression, psychiatry has come a long way from the so-called chemical imbalance theory of depression, which was more an invention of pharmaceutical companies than an actual theory propounded by psychiatrists.

{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "My grandfather\u2019s parents came west from Arkansas, looking for healthier climes after a malarial disaster, and the family never had much money and always voted Democratic. Today their middle-class equivalents would likely be making the same migration in reverse (or at the very least lighting out for rural, Trumpier parts of the West Coast, as a Californian uncle of mine did), having been priced out of what was once their promised land. And the fact that many of these migrants might be natural Trump constituents is a good example of the futility of reducing Trump\u2019s appeal to an either-or of racism or economic grievance. Is an ex-Californian who\u2019s doing O.K. economically but lives in a hotter, flatter, less glamorous and ocean-breeze-kissed part of the country than his parents, and who gripes that what was once his middle-class hometown is now all immigrants speaking Spanish and the liberal superrich, worried about ethnic or socioeconomic displacement? The answer really can be both.\n\nSo the same trends that have made California so uniformly liberal have also encouraged Trumpism elsewhere \u2014 and not only elsewhere, since as Jason Willick and James Hitchcock pointed out in 2016 in The American Interest, Trumpism-the-ideology is very much a made-in-California affair. Not many members of the right-wing intelligentsia backed Trump, but the writers and thinkers who did \u2014 from mainstream conservatives to the alt-right fringe \u2014 were heavily Californian: the Claremont Institute\u2019s West Coast Straussians, Michael \u201cFlight 93 Election\u201d Anton, Mickey Kaus, Victor Davis Hanson, Ron Unz, Steve Sailer, Scott Adams, Curtis \u201cMencius Moldbug\u201d Yarvin \u2026 and of course the one and only Peter Thiel.\n\nThis clutch of internal dissidents doesn\u2019t pose a threat to liberal hegemony in California. But the state\u2019s larger exile population does present a problem for the \u201cmake America California\u201d project, because while you can displace Republican-leaning voters from one state, you can\u2019t do the same for the country as a whole. There will be no white-middle-class out-migration to, say, Hungary to ease the path to a Democratic supermajority. A fully ascendant liberalism would have co-opt or crush groups that in California politics simply diminished or disappeared.\n\nAnd ambitious liberals will have to do so while evangelizing on behalf of a social-political model that right now looks nothing like the ideal egalitarian society liberalism claims that it can build. Under one-party liberal rule, California is presently as unequal as a Central American republic, with one of the highest poverty rates in the country once you control for its exorbitant cost of living. Its educational performance is lousy and its racial gaps are stark \u2014 which is why it\u2019s not only lower-middle class whites moving back to red America, and why black complaints about white liberal gentrifiers in SoCal or the Bay Area can resemble the complaints of Trump-leaning ex-Californians. As in other enclaves where Democrats are dominant, its ruling party has proved itself pretty good at rentier-friendly environmentalism and kicking social conservatives while they\u2019re down, O.K. enough at redistribution, and completely terrible at figuring how to build an information-age middle class.\n\nTo visit the West Coast, now and always, is to be overwhelmed by its beauty \u2014 the blue water and blue skies, the temperate air and the beaches and the looming mountains not so far away. But to imagine America remade in California\u2019s image is to imagine the state\u2019s social and political order, its upper class-service class-underclass hierarchy, expanded to landscapes that lack the balm of all that beauty, and lack an easy exit for the discontented as well.\n\nSuch an expansion might be in our future; as went California after Pete Wilson and Ah-nuld, so might America after Trump. But I suspect a new order along these lines would be uglier and more unstable, its ruling party far more easily undone or overthrown, than in the sun-kissed aristocracy that liberals have built for themselves in what was once, but no longer, the proving ground for the American dream.", "title": "Opinion | Liberalism\u2019s Golden Dream", "authors": []}

Blinken, a deputy secretary of state under Mr. Obama. \u201cI would be very concerned that the combination of Libya and then Trump tearing up the Iran agreement sends exactly the wrong message to Kim Jong-un and undermines whatever hope exists for negotiations.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton raised the Libya example in weekend interviews on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS and \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d his first television appearances since becoming national security adviser early this month.\n\n\u201cWe have very much in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004,\u201d he said on Fox. \u201cThere are obviously differences. The Libyan program was much smaller, but that was basically the agreement that we made.\u201d\n\nThe most important comparison, he said, would be testing North Korea to see if it had genuinely made an unqualified determination to abandon its nuclear weapons. \u201cIt would be a manifestation of the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Bolton said on CBS. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be the same as Libya, but it\u2019s got to be something concrete and tangible. It may be that Kim Jong-un has some ideas and we should hear him out.\u201d\n\nIn the history of the atomic age, only four countries have voluntarily given up nuclear weapons. South Africa ended its secret nuclear program in 1989, destroying a half-dozen bombs. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan all gave up the nuclear weapons that were stationed on their territory after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and they became independent nations.\n\nBut Ukraine has found reason for second-guessing. The Budapest Memorandum that sealed its denuclearization in 1994 included promises by the United States, Britain and Russia to respect the country\u2019s sovereignty and borders. But in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and supported Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Given that, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament said at the time that \u201cnow there\u2019s a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake\u201d in giving up its weapons.\n\nOthers like Brazil and Taiwan sought nuclear weapons but abandoned the efforts short of building bombs. Iran was not known to have weapons but did have a nuclear program that seemed intended to develop them when it signed an agreement with Mr. Obama\u2019s administration in 2015 to give up its program \u2014 the same agreement Mr. Trump has excoriated and threatened to rip up by May 12.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly, Libya did not have nuclear weapons but had a program to develop them when it changed course in 2003. Colonel Qaddafi initiated secret negotiations with the Bush administration and the British to dismantle his program in exchange for easing international sanctions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the key agreement came just days after Iraq\u2019s deposed leader, Saddam Hussein, was found in a spider hole in Iraq after an American invasion that had been justified as an effort to rid a dangerous regime of weapons of mass destruction. Colonel Qaddafi signaled that he did not intend to suffer the same fate.\n\nRobert Joseph, the national security aide who brokered the deal for Mr. Bush with the support of Mr. Bolton, said on Sunday that his former colleague was right to look to Libya. \u201cI do think John\u2019s onto something here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLook, Libya is not North Korea,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Libyan program was far more advanced than we had thought it was, but it\u2019s far less advanced than where North Korea is today. No question, Libya does not represent the sort of military threat that North Korea does. The two situations are different.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not saying we\u2019re going to do everything just like we did with Libya,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re drawing lessons from that experience. If you don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re going to end up right where we\u2019ve ended up before multiple times over the last 25 years, which is failure.\u201d\n\nAmong the lessons of Libya that apply to North Korea, he said, echoing Mr. Bolton\u2019s comment, is the need for a genuine decision by Mr. Kim to completely give up his program, not just hedge. Another is to use all the tools available, including intelligence, economic leverage, diplomacy and threat of force. Another is to insist on complete \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d access for inspectors to all potential nuclear sites.\n\nBut other specialists find the situations so different that the comparison is unhelpful. \u201cLibya hardly had a nuclear weapons program,\u201d said Robert J. Einhorn, a special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control in Mr. Obama\u2019s State Department and now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt had crates with centrifuge parts it didn\u2019t know what to do with. U.S. transport planes could land and carry the entire \u2018program\u2019 away.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, said Mr. Einhorn, \u201cNorth Korea has nuclear weapons. We don\u2019t know how many. It has nuclear production facilities. We don\u2019t know where they all are. Verifying what they have and dismantling all of it would take years.\u201d\n\nColonel Qaddafi\u2019s violent end was not directly related to the 2003 deal. Nearly eight years after his agreement with Mr. Bush, the Libyan dictator was confronted with a popular uprising as part of the Arab Spring 2011. He vowed to crush his opponents, including civilians, prompting Mr. Obama and European allies to intervene to stop him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Obama administration at the time denied any connection between the intervention and the previous nuclear disarmament. But Mr. Joseph said Mr. Obama should have given more thought to the consequences. \u201cThey made the decision to intervene without a day-after plan or any sense of what nonproliferation message that would send,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Korea has made this connection before. In 2011, North Korea\u2019s official news agency carried comments by a Foreign Ministry official calling the earlier nuclear bargain with Libya \u201can invasion tactic to disarm the country,\u201d in effect a bait-and-switch. \u201cThe Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson,\u201d the ministry official said.\n\nEach side sees its own very different lessons.", "title": "Libya as a Model for Disarmament?

Most people believe he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe mystery over General Hifter\u2019s health is a sharp blow to the authority of a domineering if divisive figure and threatens the contentious stability he brought to eastern Libya.\n\nAfter Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was ousted from power in 2011, Libya shattered into a patchwork of rival towns, tribes and militias. General Hifter restored a kind of order to its eastern half by vanquishing his Islamist enemies.\n\nA former military officer who led a failed C.I.A.-backed effort to oust Colonel Qaddafi in the late 1980s, General Hifter launched an audacious bid for control of Benghazi in 2014 with the help of a coalition of tribal, neighborhood and religious militias.\n\nAfter three years of grinding battle that left large parts of the city in rubble and displaced thousands of residents, he finally defeated the last Islamist militias in December.\n\nBut supporters have long worried that his age might diminish his fitness for the hectic pace of Libya\u2019s notoriously complex battle for supremacy. Even if he does prove fit enough to return to work, his illness has dealt a blow to his carefully cultivated persona of a leader with the muscle to rule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHis strongman image has been ruined,\u201d Mr. Megerisi said. \u201cNow he\u2019s the sick man of Libya.\u201d\n\nGeneral Hifter has no obvious successor. He groomed two sons in recent years, promoting them to command positions in his Libyan National Army. But the sons, Khalid and Saddam, have seen little front-line combat, and experts say it is unclear whether they enjoy the authority to take over.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough General Hifter styles himself as a military virtuoso who forged Libya\u2019s only disciplined army, in practice his Libyan National Army is a loose coalition of militias headed by strong-willed commanders. Now, every day that he is absent from Benghazi, speculation grows that his coalition could crack as rival commanders turn on each other.\n\nThere have been hints of internal tensions in recent months as commanders have publicly chafed under General Hifter\u2019s rule or criticized one another. The growing prominence in his administration of religious conservatives who have tried to impose restrictions on women and burn books has become a source of worry among city residents.\n\nOne special forces commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for his role in seven summary mass executions in which 33 people were killed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The United Arab Emirates has stationed warplanes and drones at several air bases in eastern Libya to shore up General Hifter\u2019s forces. France sent paramilitary forces to help him defeat the Islamists in Benghazi, where three French officers were killed in a helicopter crash in 2016.\n\nAmerican diplomats have largely kept their distance from General Hifter in public, viewing him as a hindrance to political talks, although the C.I.A. has renewed its ties with him and established a presence in Benghazi, as have a handful of American Special Forces commandos at an air base outside the city.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAny sidelining of General Hifter could have a domino effect across Libya, potentially affecting oil production and efforts to strike a political peace deal. Yet the refusal of his aides to release even a photo or a video to support their claims that he is well only fueled conjecture about his health.\n\nLast week, several French news outlets reported that General Hifter had suffered a serious stroke in Jordan. On Thursday, the website Middle East Eye, citing a European diplomat, said he had been partly incapacitated. A senior United Nations official said they had received similar reports.\n\nThe French government has seemed determined to say as little as possible. French officials would confirm only that General Hifter was being cared for in a hospital in the Paris region but offered no information about his condition.\n\nIn a closed meeting on Wednesday, France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, told Parliament that General Hifter was \u201cdoing better,\u201d Radio France International reported.\n\nFor several years France openly sided with General Hifter, to the detriment of the United Nations-backed unity government in Tripoli, in an effort to project French power while forming alliances with local forces fighting Islamist extremism.\n\nMore recently, Paris has taken a more evenhanded approach. President Emmanuel Macron hosted peace talks in Paris last July that brought together General Hifter and Fayez Serraj, who leads the unity government in Tripoli.\n\nOn Thursday, the French ambassador to Libya, Brigitte Curmi, and the United Nations envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, visited Tripoli to discuss the latest round of those discussions, although their meeting was overshadowed by a rocket attack on the city airport that damaged a parked civilian airliner.\n\nAsked whether elections would be held in Libya this year, Mr. Salam\u00e9 said: \u201cSure.

{"date": "2018-04-27 00:00:00", "text": "Through interviews with those who managed to escape, Mikhail has created a searing portrait of courage, humanity and savagery, told in a mosaic of voices. We learn of the slave markets where women are bought and sold, and of the online auction sites where they are listed simply as \u201cGirl #1\u201d or \u201cGirl #2.\u201d Fetching anywhere from a dollar to $500, they are raped, \u201crented\u201d and used as forced labor. For ISIS fighters (referred to here as Daesh), such are the spoils of war.\n\nImage\n\nLinking their stories is a Yazidi Schindler named Abdullah, a beekeeper who has made it his mission to rescue the enslaved women after many of his family members were taken, including his sister. \u201cEvery day that I save a captive woman I save her, too,\u201d he tells Mikhail. Using his extensive contacts and knowledge of roads throughout Iraq and Syria, he organizes a \u201chive\u201d of smugglers of both sexes to engineer cunning rescue operations. There are many such heroes in these varied accounts, not least the women themselves, and details so astounding that it was wise of the author to include photographs bearing witness to their truth.\n\nThe smugglers are paid by the Kurdistan Region of Iraq\u2019s Office of Kidnapped Affairs. (Yes, there is such a thing, established in response to the captive-taking.) It is dangerous work, and many smugglers lose their lives in ambushes and airstrikes. But even more remarkable in this heart of darkness are the selfless acts of mercy by strangers who help the women elude their captors.\n\nOne beneficiary of such kindness is Zuhour, sold as a house slave along with her three small children to a man who starves them. (The children in these accounts are typically employed to make munitions or, in the case of older boys, sent to training centers where their swift conversion to ISIS ideology is as unsettling as the battle skills they are taught.) After running away, terrified of armed patrols sent to round her and her children up, Zuhour enters a sewing shop situated inside a house, begging the seamstress there to give them shelter. \u201cI would like to help you,\u201d the young woman replies, \u201cbut the trouble is that my father is a member of Daesh.\u201d\n\nShe helps anyway. Her father fights on three-week rotations, returning to the house for a few days of rest. On those days the seamstress hides Zuhour and her children in her sewing room \u2014 the only place her father never sets foot. This goes on for two months, until the women get hold of a Kurdistan phone book and start calling numbers at random. (A common problem for the captives is not being able to remember numbers from their confiscated phones.) The first person to answer contacts Zuhour\u2019s uncle, who calls the beekeeper, who sends a female smuggler to pose as a customer.\n\nThis is one story among many, which together illuminate a human catastrophe that might otherwise be a mere footnote to the still-unfolding consequences of the Iraq war. Mikhail, whose gifts as a poet infuse these narratives with unexpected beauty, is interested in the little things: \u201cI mean the little things with their big shadows.\u201d", "title": "Like a Schindler for Iraq, This Unlikely War Hero Freed Women From ISIS", "authors": []}

Both emerged from the street-dance scenes in their hometowns, Memphis (Buck) and Miami (Boogz). They met at an open jam session at the Debbie Reynolds Dance Studio in Los Angeles almost 10 years ago. As they put it, they recognized each other\u2019s skills but also connected on a higher plane, as two idealists who believe that dance can bring people closer and perhaps even change the way they think.\n\nBuck does Memphis jookin\u2019 and Boogz\u2019s background is in popping. But despite their different styles, they started performing together along the tourist-filled 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Their shows aimed to touch people rather than just entertain them. \u201cPeople would cry watching our performances,\u201d Buck said about those open-air events. \u201cIt was a whole different experience for them.\u201d\n\nThey both have busy careers, but alongside touring with big-name rock stars like Madonna (Buck) and Gloria Estefan (Boogz), taking part in the Vail Dance Festival (Buck), and collaborating on a recent Rag & Bone fashion campaign that featured Mikhail Baryshnikov, the two started to plot ways to reach new audiences with dances that addressed larger societal issues like racism, police violence, immigration and the destruction of the environment.\n\nTogether, they founded MAI (Movement Art Is), a nonprofit that produces dance videos, and now live performances, for which they share choreographic credit. Their film \u201cColor of Reality,\u201d made in conjunction with the painter Alexa Meade, was inspired by their dismay at police shootings of black men, and has been seen online more than 300,000 times. They are also featured in Terrence Malick\u2019s short virtual reality film, \u201cTogether,\u201d which will have its New York debut at the Tribeca Film Festival later this month. (There will also be a 2D version.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis year, too, Buck and Boogz made their first evening-length show, \u201cLove Heals All Wounds,\u201d which has been touring the country since January and comes to the Skirball Center at New York University on Saturday. It is structured as a series of dance scenes punctuated by poetry, composed and performed by Robin Sanders. Each section deals with a contemporary social ill. \u201cA lot of the things we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Boogz said, \u201cfrom police brutality to mass incarceration to gender equality and racial equality, we grew up with that. There\u2019s a certain struggle that is passed down.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nI caught up with Buck, 29, and Boogz, 30, on Skype after a recent performance of \u201cLove Heals All Wounds\u201d in West Palm Beach, Fla.

There are debuts galore, unfamiliar \u201cnotable names,\u201d and endearing but hardly simple running references to noshing. As icing on the cake, it\u2019s a pangram; every letter appears at least once in the grid.\n\nI loved some of the clues today, like for LEGO, TUNE, WINDUP, SQUIB, FAIR DICE and OPENS WIDE. I knew nothing about ALDEN or RANKIN and look sideways, a little, at HOSE and HEWER, which sounds like a certain kind of law firm.\n\nTricky Clues\n\n17A: Well, when I first sussed out this clue I cringed a little, only because I\u2019m a bit of a margarita purist (on the rocks with some salt, always nice on a balmy evening, if one of those ever happens again) and not much of a beer fan. Once I\u2019d pieced together BEERGARITA, a term I\u2019d never seen, I figured this had to be a Homer Simpsonism, but after reading some enthusiastic reviews my interest is (a little) piqued. It doesn\u2019t sound very posh, though, does it, and they\u2019re probably $18 at the bar in spite of that. Must make at home.\n\n20A: Supplier of the critical Z and a tiny history lesson, TANZANIA did not formally exist before 1964, when Tanganyika, which had been part of German East Africa on the continent\u2019s mainland, combined with the Zanzibar archipelago to form a nation. German East Africa was essentially a corporate name for a huge trading company that colonized a large area of Africa in the late 1800s.

And while there was a security person provided for us at stadium events, at off-site events, which could draw hundreds of fans, we were on our own.\n\nAt our orientation, our captain told us to expect harassment from fans. \u201cWhen a fan gets too close or gropes you,\u201d she said, \u201calways smile. If a guy grabs you too tightly, take his hand off you and put your arm around him instead.\u201d We were told to be polite and courteous, and to never get angry with fans, no matter what they did.\n\nSome male fans leered, stared at our breasts and tried to grab us when we posed for photos with them. Bar events were particularly unpleasant because the men were often inebriated. When I posed with them, they would try to do a \u201cboob hug,\u201d reaching their hands around, raising them slowly and trying to touch the side of my breast. I had to delicately (but never angrily) move the hand to my waist or arrange myself far enough away that they couldn\u2019t touch me.\n\nFan interactions could even be punishment for breaking the rules. On the Ben-Gals, once the cheerleaders were chosen for the four corners of the field, any women who did not \u201cmake corner\u201d (often because of their weight) were not allowed on the field for the game. Instead, they had to go to the private suites to mingle with fans, who could be rude and ungracious. One of the reasons we all worked so hard to \u201cmake corner\u201d was to avoid having to make a suite appearance.\n\nIn the past, most cheerleaders put up with these brutal conditions, figuring that cheering was a temporary job and there was no point fighting to change it when it was meant to be a steppingstone. Those who did complain were often shunned or punished. The overriding message we received from our directors and captains was that complainers were replaceable. Some of the more vocal women would be disqualified (by the captains) from participating in paid events, as punishment for speaking out.\n\nFortunately, cheerleader conditions are improving. The Seattle Seahawks were the first to offer minimum wage to their cheerleaders, in 1997. Cheerleaders for the Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers now get minimum wage and overtime, as do the Ben-Gals, after lawsuits and settlements. After one of my fellow cheerleaders initiated a class-action suit against the Bengals for violation of federal employment laws, we received $255,000 in back pay. My own payout was $7,500 for three years of cheering. Today a minimum-wage cheerleader can make several thousand per year, which might cover a chunk of the cost of pantyhose, hair extensions, cosmetics and gasoline that they buy with their own money.\n\nSome football fans adore us and can\u2019t envision the game without us. Others think we\u2019re bad dancers and relics of a more sexist era. But one thing is indisputable: Cheerleaders bring in money. A 2003 Forbes magazine article estimated that N.F.L. teams with cheerleaders bring in $1 million in revenue per team in calendar sales, appearances, sponsorships and clothing lines. Cheerleaders also bring traffic to team websites with blogs, photos and contests. Public events and web traffic can lead to increased ticket sales for games and a higher profile for team sponsors.", "title": "Opinion | Little to Cheer About", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "text": "Take, for example, an April 2016 concert in Nashville where Ticketmaster added a $14.75 fee on top of a $36 ticket for a show in an amphitheater Live Nation owned. Even Michael Rapino, Live Nation\u2019s chief executive, called that fee \u201cnot defendable,\u201d according to an internal email.\n\nHolding onto venues is critical to a company that relies so much on ticket fees. Mr. Rapino has repeatedly boasted to Wall Street that the number of venues it tickets around the world \u2014 a statistic it does not release \u2014 is constantly growing.\n\nFor the live music market, a larger question going forward is whether Live Nation is now so big, so empowered by the merger, that competition in ticketing at the major venues is effectively blocked. Jared Smith, the president of Ticketmaster in North America, said no, that evidence of vibrant competition can be seen in the innovative technology and better deals that his company must now offer venues to keep them from switching to a rival.\n\n\u201cThe space is more competitive than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working harder each and every year.\u201d\n\nAEG acknowledges that some part of its difficulty in securing contracts is rooted in its own missteps in developing a competitive ticketing system. And certainly, at the lower reaches of the market, Ticketmaster\u2019s share is not nearly so commanding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that Ticketmaster, by whatever means, has kept its rivals from gaining a meaningful foothold in the market for major music venues.\n\nPreserving competition in the ticketing market was a chief concern for regulators when the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was proposed in 2009. Live Nation, which had long stayed in its lane as a promoter and venue operator, had just begun to sell tickets and was taking on that role at some 110 venues.\n\nIf the two companies merged, that competition \u2014 a healthy marketplace development, as regulators saw it \u2014 would disappear.\n\nSo, as part of the consent decree, Justice officials ordered steps that they hoped would enable two new robust challengers. One measure required Ticketmaster to license its ticketing software \u2014 the proprietary system that allowed it to service swarms of customers when a popular concert went on sale \u2014 to its competitor AEG.\n\nIt was also required to divest a ticketing subsidiary, Paciolan, to another competitor.\n\nBut, as it turned out, AEG never licensed the Ticketmaster software because, it said, it did not view the technology as cutting edge. The company that Ticketmaster sold off, Paciolan, remained a niche player in the music end of the business.\n\n\u201cIt has now been eight years since the merger and the world does not look a lot different,\u201d said John E. Kwoka Jr., a professor of economics at Northeastern University and a longtime critic of the merger.\n\nMs. Varney declined to comment on the effectiveness of the agreement she had shepherded. But the antitrust division\u2019s former chief counsel, Gene Kimmelman, said the Justice Department had been hampered in what it could do to create competition in an industry already so dominated by one company.\n\n\u201cThe people who came in to oversee this transaction were very interested in doing everything imaginable to create more competition in ticketing in the marketplace,\u201d he said, \u201cand were frustrated that the options were unbelievably limited.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTalent Needs\n\nFew buildings in Louisville are as important to the local economy as the KFC Yum! Center, a 22,000-seat arena on the banks of the Ohio River that features a mix of events, from Louisville Cardinals basketball games to concerts by Garth Brooks.\n\nIn 2012, Live Nation submitted a joint bid with another company for a contract to manage the arena. Three people who listened to Live Nation\u2019s pitch said in interviews that the company said some of its tours might skip the arena if it lost the deal.\n\n\u201cOne of their main selling points was the relationship with the talent that they had and their ability to determine where that talent chose to play,\u201d said Larry Hayes, who was then chairman of the Louisville Arena Authority, which oversees the venue.\n\nThe arena picked AEG anyway.\n\nMr. Fikre and other AEG officials say that two years later, when their company considered replacing Ticketmaster with their own ticketing service, AXS, Live Nation gave a warning.\n\nOver dinner on the night of a Miley Cyrus concert in August 2014, they said, a Live Nation executive told AEG\u2019s local venue manager that some Live Nation tours would likely bypass Louisville if AEG made good on its plan to replace Ticketmaster.\n\nThis is one of the incidents that AEG complained about to the Justice Department, pointing out that the consent decree specifically forbids Live Nation from threatening to withhold shows from venues that do not hire Ticketmaster.\n\nThe AEG account is supported by an internal email in which its employee reports being warned that the Yum! Center might lose \u201ctoss of the coin shows\u201d \u2014 the kind that could go to a nearby arena \u2014 if Ticketmaster was dumped.\n\nMr. Hayes said in an interview that he had not been aware of a second warning. He had, in fact, endorsed retaining Ticketmaster, he said: It had served the arena well. But the letter of endorsement he wrote to AEG made plain that he understood there was a nexus between employing Ticketmaster and retaining access to Live Nation talent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDue to the relationship between Ticketmaster and Live Nation,\u201d Mr. Hayes wrote, \u201cand knowing how important content is to our financial stability, the Louisville Arena Authority is requesting that AEG receive a formal bid from Ticketmaster to retain its business at the KFC Yum! Center.\u201d\n\nAEG officials say they ultimately ditched the plan to replace Ticketmaster because they worried the venue might lose show revenue.\n\nLive Nation disputed the account of warnings and supplied data showing that since 2012 the number of tours it has sent to the KFC Yum! Center has only increased. (Even at the Gwinnett Center outside Atlanta, now known as the Infinite Energy Center, the number of Live Nation shows rebounded after dropping off in 2014.)\n\nThere is little evidence, actually, of Live Nation retaliation. Competitors say that is because venues so rarely stray.\n\nCritics say enforcement of the consent decree has been complicated by what they call its ambiguous language. Though it forbids Live Nation from forcing a client to buy both its talent and ticketing, the agreement lets the company \u201cbundle\u201d its services \u201cin any combination.\u201d So Live Nation is barred from punishing an arena by, say, steering a star like Drake to appear at a rival stop down the road. But it\u2019s also allowed, under the agreement, to redirect a concert if it can defend the decision as sound business.\n\nMr. Buffier, of the New York Attorney General\u2019s office, said the ambiguity creates \u201chigh burdens to prove violations in court.\u201d\n\nCompetitors assert that the bundling lets Live Nation pressure venues without ever uttering a threat.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to,\u201d said Marc Leibowitz, co-owner of One Percent Productions, an independent concert promoter in Omaha. \u201cIt\u2019s just implied.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDavid Willis, a former ticketing executive who left Ticketmaster in 2014, said the company was always careful to instruct the sales staff to respect the rules as to how talent could be mentioned when pitching an arena for business.\n\n\u201cWe were not saying, certainly, \u2018If you don\u2019t go with us you are losing that,\u2019\u201d he said. But he acknowledged, \u201cI would imagine that that is what they assumed to be the case.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Regulator\u2019s Quandary\n\nLive Nation and AEG both have their headquarters in Los Angeles, and last summer the companies faced off in a contract dispute over a new Major League Soccer team there, the Los Angeles Football Club.\n\nTrouble began brewing when the team began looking for someone to ticket its new stadium downtown, due to open this month.\n\nTicketmaster put in a bid. But the team insisted that Live Nation bring in some concerts as well. Live Nation balked \u2014 soccer stadiums, executives said, were a poor fit for concerts \u2014 but it struck a preliminary deal that included ticketing and a commitment to provide a few shows each year.\n\nThen the plan hit a snag. AEG owned another professional soccer team in Los Angeles \u2014 the Galaxy \u2014 and had an agreement with Major League Soccer: If another franchise from Los Angeles joined the league, AEG had the right to match any competitor\u2019s ticketing offer.\n\nWielding that clause as leverage, AEG blocked the selection of Ticketmaster, and the contract instead went to SeatGeek, an upstart company that had deals with a number of M.L.S. teams.\n\nThe Ticketmaster executives were furious and threatened to sue. They told the team owners that, if there was no Ticketmaster contract, they would not be getting the Live Nation shows. The team then complained to Major League Soccer that Live Nation had threatened to withhold talent, according to a statement by the league.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLive Nation denied it had made any kind of threat and pointed out that the soccer league has a small equity stake in SeatGeek. It said the arena had simply pulled out of a package deal that covered both ticketing and concerts \u2014 just the sort of bundling, it said, the Justice Department settlement had allowed. Without ticketing, according to Live Nation officials, it simply made no economic sense to put concerts in a space built for soccer.\n\nBut the consent decree, which expires in 2020, also says Live Nation cannot \u201ccondition or threaten to condition the provision of live entertainment events\u201d if a venue decides to use another company for ticketing.\n\nSo is this a case of bullying, or just a business decision?\n\n\u201cLive Nation and Ticketmaster,\u201d the company said in a statement \u201cdo not \u2018condition\u2019 the placement of concerts at venues on becoming the venue\u2019s ticketing provider. Venues, on the other hand, often condition the ticketing contract on guaranteed content.\u201d\n\nAntitrust experts said this was the kind of thicket that Justice officials must navigate as they reviewed the antitrust complaints.\n\nSince the dust up, Live Nation has returned to the table and is discussing bringing acts to the stadium. The team declined to comment on the dispute. SeatGeek ended up holding onto the contract.\n\nBut the perception that Live Nation might withhold talent is prevalent enough that SeatGeek now structures some bids to address the concerns of venues who fear losing big stars, and revenues.\n\nFor example, last year, when SeatGeek tried to unseat Ticketmaster from its contract at the TD Garden in Boston, it included in its bid a promise to pay the arena $250,000 for every show that Live Nation pulled, according to a bid document reviewed by the Times and three people with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nTicketmaster still won. TD Garden officials said the contract was awarded on the merits, and they had not received threats.\n\nA SeatGeek spokesperson declined to discuss the negotiations. But Russ D\u2019Souza, a founder of the company, said he has seen evidence that competition in the market is less than open.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen we sell to teams,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have heard fears about losing concerts if they choose us.\u201d", "title": "Live Nation Rules Music Ticketing, Some Say With Threats", "authors": ["Ben Sisario", "Graham Bowley"]}

Guardiola, later, was right to point out a handful of refereeing decisions that went against his team \u2014 most notably a second goal, just before halftime, that was incorrectly ruled out by an offside call \u2014 but, ultimately, that did not explain quite why City wilted so notably in the second half. One Liverpool goal, from Mohamed Salah, drew City\u2019s sting; another, from Roberto Firmino, broke its hearts, and Liverpool walked away with a 2-1 victory for a 5-1 aggregate win.\n\nIn Rome, though, something remarkable was happening. Roma had started the evening down 4-1 after a calamitous first leg in Barcelona in which it had scored three own goals.\n\nThere was precious little hope, even in Italy, for a comeback. \u201cLittle Italy and Great Spain,\u201d ran the headline in Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian sports daily. Nobody gave the team sitting fourth in Serie A much of a chance against Lionel Messi and the rest.\n\nAnd yet, as Klopp said, the Champions League \u201cis quite fair.\u201d Everybody has a chance, no matter how slim, no matter what team they are playing. An 82nd minute goal from Kostas Manolas, the Greek defender, sealed a 3-0 win for the host and eliminated Barcelona on the away-goals rule.\n\nFans inside the Stadio Olimpico cried tears of joy. Cengiz \u00dcnder, the Turkish winger signed in the summer to replace Salah, as it happens, cradled his head in his hands, as if in shock.

That year, it lost to Liverpool in the final.\n\nPhoto\n\nA repeat still remains a distant prospect, of course \u2014 Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, both likely to progress on Wednesday, were most likely not too disappointed to see both Barcelona and City eliminated \u2014 but it provides a salutary reminder that nothing can be taken for granted in this competition.\n\nKlopp, after all, was not merely being polite when he insisted, once again, that Liverpool had beaten perhaps the best team in Europe to progress. What Guardiola has achieved with City in his second season should not be masked by a disappointing week: three defeats, two to Liverpool and one, on Saturday, to Manchester United, depriving City of the chance to claim a Premier League title against its fiercest rival.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike Barcelona, City will still end the season as a domestic champion, without question, but it will do so with less of a triumphant air than perhaps it deserves.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Over the last 10 months, as Guardiola said, City has been \u201cpretty good.\u201d It set a Premier League record for most consecutive wins. It established a lead at the top of the table that has reached as high as 18 points. It has scored three or more goals in 23 separate games. It has been a glorious season.\n\nWhether the Premier League is the \u201cmost prestigious\u201d competition in the world \u2014 as Guardiola labeled it \u2014 is debatable; that City has dominated a league that contains a handful of outstanding teams, including one good enough to make the Champions League semifinal, is not.\n\nThat it did not win the title in perfect style, that it has faltered a little at the end, that Liverpool eventually had the will and the wit to win out over two legs does not mean all of that is wiped off the slate; it does not make the paeans of praise it has won any less valid.\n\nThat City could not quite live up to the exalted status bestowed upon it \u2014 Guardiola, after all, was being asked before Christmas whether his team could win all four competitions it entered \u2014 is not failure: It is simply proof that it is not, yet, perfect.\n\nThe same could be said for Barcelona, of course, though the reaction in Catalonia is likely to be less sanguine than it will be in Manchester. There will be calls for the overhaul of the squad, for a new coach, for revolution. Guardiola will not have to deal with any of that: he will simply come back and try to be better next year.\n\n\u201cLast year we made the last 16, this year the quarterfinals,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cHopefully next year we can make the semis.\u201d He said it with a smile, though. He is aiming higher.\n\nHe must, though, endure the disappointment of another abortive European campaign, another year in which this competition has brought nothing but pain to Manchester City. It will be of little solace \u2014 and none at all to Barcelona \u2014 but that is, in a way, a mark of how far this club has come.\n\nTo Liverpool and Roma, reaching the Champions League semifinals is an unexpected bonus, an impossible dream. To Manchester City, as to Barcelona, not doing so is in some way falling short. That is the company City keeps now, the sights it has set. Barcelona going out shocked Klopp, as it shocked Europe.

New York City, with a roughly comparable population size, had 292 murders last year, according to the 2018 Police Commissioner\u2019s Report, and that was a record low. In Britain, however, the prospect has been enough to alarm politicians and command newspaper front pages.\n\nAnalysts say that the surge in violent crime has been driven by several factors, including rivalries between drug gangs, cuts to youth services and social programs, and even the ease with which teenagers can now taunt and provoke one another on social media.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to address the causes of violence without addressing important social questions about the choices facing young people in terms of opportunities,\u201d said Roger Grimshaw, the research director at the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London.\n\nDavid Lammy, a lawmaker for the north London district of Tottenham, which has been hit hard by violent crime in recent weeks, said there was not one single cause for the surge, but that drug gangs were a major factor.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat drives the gangs and the turf wars is an 11 billion pound cocaine drugs market,\u201d he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program.

You can get them on Snapchat, WhatsApp. That, in the end, is driving the turf war; and it\u2019s driving the culture of violence.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the police had lost control of the drugs market, which he said was largely controlled by Eastern European gangs. Gangs increasingly use children and teenagers to carry drugs around the country, making them potential casualties in fighting between groups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost of the killings in London so far have been stabbings, most apparently carried out by young people.

But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201d\n\nMany of the trade measures that Mr. Trump has proposed, including the steel and aluminum tariffs, have divided his advisers, the business community and the Republican Party. But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China\u2019s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach.\n\nThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.\n\nAmerican companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities.\n\nLate last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers.\n\nAs Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCompanies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.\n\nPhoto\n\nTechnology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China\u2019s importance as a market for exports.\n\nThe 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana.

These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China\u2019s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said.\n\nHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.\n\nCompanies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.\n\nRestrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe measures come on top of proposed legislation in Congress to expand the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals for national security concerns.

(The former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claims to have had an affair with Trump, has said that he tried to pay her the first time they had sex.) In another, he said he\u2019d just remembered that he never even stayed overnight in Moscow: \u201cHe claimed he had flown from New York, had only gone to the hotel to change his clothes, and had flown home that same night,\u201d Comey writes.\n\nThough Comey doesn\u2019t mention it, this contradicts the story that Trump\u2019s former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, reportedly told the House Intelligence Committee about that night. Schiller said that a Russian associate offered to send five women to Trump\u2019s room, but was turned down. \u201cSchiller said the two men laughed about it as Trump went to bed alone,\u201d NBC reported. \u201cSchiller testified that he stood outside Trump\u2019s hotel room for a time and then went to bed.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lies here are of more than voyeuristic interest.

Perched on a bluff overlooking downtown and separated by the Los Angeles River, Boyle Heights, a neighborhood of about 100,000 residents, has long suffered from a host of land-use inequities, including its proximity to polluting freeways that decimated housing and sliced the community\u2019s largest park in half.\n\nThree-quarters of the housing units in Boyle Heights are currently rentals. And the fact that the neighborhood is near the downtown Arts District across the river has brought the issue of displacement to the fore. Art galleries and house flippers have moved in and longtime tenants have received eviction notices, raising the specter of \u201cIkea catalogs in the barrio,\u201d as Josefina L\u00f3pez, the artistic director of Casa 0101 Theater and the writer of \u201cReal Women Have Curves,\u201d put it.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her play \u201cHipsteria,\u201d Ms. L\u00f3pez imagined the last building in Boyle Heights 20 years hence, occupied by hipsters wanting to turn it into a dog hotel. \u201cBoyle Heights is not a blank canvas,\u201d she observed. \u201cIt\u2019s a rich tapestry of immigrant history, culture and activism.\u201d\n\nIt has long been an immigrant hub: The historic Breed Street Shul was the oldest Orthodox synagogue west of Chicago. (The rear building is now a community center.) The neighborhood\u2019s landscape is distinctly Latino, with artful front-yard altars dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and Mexican-American murals bringing vibrant life to peeling walls.\n\nIn recent years, Union de Vecinos has been deeply involved in pro-tenant and antigallery activism, some of it confrontational. (Several galleries, including the artist-run 356 Mission, have announced they will close here.) But over the past two decades, its leaders have also worked hard to make the neighborhood cleaner and safer in the face of longstanding disinvestment. The alleyways crisscrossing the neighborhood were especially dangerous, filled with trash by people pulling off the freeways to dump construction waste, and had become magnets for illegal activity.\n\nThe group got rid of the litter and gang graffiti, installed brightly painted speed bumps and, in an alley near a liquor store, planted a garden full of spiky cactuses.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut improving the neighborhood has become a delicate proposition. As the area becomes more habitable for residents, it grows more appealing to outsiders, putting more pressure on housing. On Avenue Cesar E. Chavez, the primary commercial street, for instance, young people with laptops and earbuds sip coffee across the street from a lone Norte\u00f1o accordionist in a sombrero standing beneath a red awning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between making something beautiful to sell it and making it useful,\u201d said Leonardo Vilchis, co-director of Union de Vecinos. \u201cSo the question is, can we make this place more livable for people living here now?\u201d\n\nWith tensions about gentrification running high, the community\u2019s decision to embrace the play street concept was not a casual one.\n\n\u201cSo many people want to come in and modify this place,\u201d said Ofelia Platon, 45, a Union de Vecinos leader who lives around the corner from Fickett Street. \u201cSo there\u2019s always a question of what would we need to give up?\u201d A mother of three, she recalled taking her son Esteban, now 17, to a nearby park and having to drop on the grass because of a shooting.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe residents chose Fickett Street with the intention of providing a safe space not just for children but for the community, said Chelina Odbert, KDI\u2019s co-founder and executive director.\n\n\u201cWhat a play street is not is a replacement for permanent parks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it bridges the gap in a way that\u2019s really needed.\u201d\n\nScarlett De Leon, a director for the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance, grew up there and said she spent much of her childhood glued to television, a pattern she now observes in her younger siblings and her great-grandmother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle that affects different generations in one family,\u201d she said. \u201cSo having a space to be creative and interact is important for emotional health.\u201d\n\nAt the play street event earlier this month, Fickett Street was alive with fathers pushing play bins down the street with children riding in them.

She did respond on a Facebook post, explaining she did not mean to body shame the couple: \u201cMy post was not fat shaming them. I am overweight. My frustration was unrealistic expectations on their part. Their weight was the issue that led to the difficulty in shooting the session and getting creative with posing. I never ever body shame anyone and am sorry if anyone thought I was doing so.\u201d\n\nWhat the incident did show was increasing exasperation by bigger brides at the bridal industry\u2019s refusal to respect them \u2014 and a groundswell of determination to stop pretending that disrespect is O.K.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you ask to have yourself photoshopped; it\u2019s a whole other thing if someone takes liberties to quote-unquote fix you,\u201d said Lauren Chan, a newly engaged size 16 from Brooklyn who is a former fashion editor at Glamour magazine.\n\nMs. Chan, like her friend Kelsey Miller, a size 16 newlywed and the author of the 2016 book \u201cBig Girl: How I Gave Up Dieting and Got a Life,\u201d was not surprised by what happened to Ms. Liepold, but no less horrified. \u201cIt\u2019s galling and everybody should be appalled, but it happens every day,\u201d said Ms. Miller, who is also from Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s popular to declare yourself \u2018body positive\u2019 and accepting of yourself, but the truth is: Bias is still very much out there.\u201d\n\nEspecially, she said, in the bridal business. \u201cEverything in the bridal world is two sizes smaller than in the real world and seven times more expensive.\u201d\n\nBrides-to-be like Ms. Liepold and Ms. Chan are refusing to play along, and finding ways to bypass what Ms. Miller called \u201cthe whole subsection of the bridal industry that is completely devoted to weight loss.\u201d Instead of shelling out for bridal boot camp or sweating for the wedding videos, they are cleansing their social media accounts of images that make them feel unlovely; exercising for \u201cthe joy of movement,\u201d as Bevin Bralandingham, a bride-to-be in Los Angeles who teaches a class called \u201cFat Kid Dance Party,\u201d said; and signing on to online bridal forums that better represent their body types.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd they are far from alone. Shannelle Armstrong-Fowler, the 6-foot, size 16 owner of Haute & Co. Bridal Boutique in Chicago, makes her living outfitting and styling brides sizes 14 to 32. Since opening the shop in 2013 after her own trials with finding a dress for her 2012 wedding, Ms. Armstrong, also the star of the PeopleTV series \u201cThe Perfect Fit,\u201d has familiarized more than 400 plus-size brides with her sassy catchphrase: \u201cStyle, snatch and slay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe style part is finding each bride her perfect gown,\u201d she explained. \u201cSnatch means altering each dress to hug and accentuate all the right curves. And slay is ensuring each bride looks fierce and is ready to make the aisle her own personal runway.\u201d\n\nThe path to slaying does not include steering brides toward gyms and personal trainers so a dress will fit better, or insisting on an A-line silhouette, the style most often thrust at bigger brides. Instead, it usually involves finding the right undergarments. Also letting discriminating designers know they should take notice because business is booming.\n\n\u201cA lot of the discord in this business comes from designers who won\u2019t design above a certain size,\u201d Ms. Armstrong-Fowler said. \u201cBut they\u2019re becoming more aware that the average woman in America is a size 16. I\u2019ve had this conversation with a lot of designers: I say, if you\u2019re not designing above a 14 or 16, you\u2019re leaving behind an enormous part of the marketplace.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

So why aren\u2019t these brands giving them something to buy?\u201d she asked.\n\nThat goes for jewelry designers, too.\n\nAlysia Cole, a size 16 stylist at Panache Bridal in Beverly Hills who was married in 2017, said, \u201cI remember a stylist trying a gorgeous bridal choker on me. It didn\u2019t fit around my neck.\u201d Some designers will add hooks or links so a necklace or bracelet fits, she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard when you can\u2019t try it on.\u201d Shopping for rehearsal dinner and bachelorette party outfits was also an exercise in disappointment: \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything cute in my size.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Ms. Cole, the news of Ms. Liepold\u2019s recent public scuffle with her engagement photographer felt redeeming. \u201cI\u2019m glad she recognizes she should be proud of how she looks,\u201d she said.

There were only two, and one of them, in a grave labeled X-35, looked promising.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the war, the Army recorded details of each set of unknown remains in records known as X files that are now digitized and widely shared by researchers. The files showed that X-35 had been exhumed and sent to Saipan to be identified, along with thousands of others. Although the grave contained socks stenciled with the name Mulligan, no match was made, and the remains were reburied in 1950 in an American cemetery in Manila.\n\nMr. Rumsby compared the file for X-35 to Private Mulligan\u2019s personnel file in 2016 and found several points of agreement.

In casting Kerry Washington as the D.C. fixer Olivia Pope, the series\u2019s creator, Shonda Rhimes, gave network TV drama its first black female lead in almost 40 years. The show has tackled difficult subjects from abortion to police violence against African-Americans with startling candor. But it also earned a reputation for its rapid-fire plot twists, often providing more shocking revelations in a single episode than many dramas do in a full season.\n\nvia Giphy\n\nBefore \u201cScandal\u201d wraps its final season, on April 19, revisit some of its wildest moments, in chronological order below. (Be warned if you aren\u2019t caught up: Spoilers abound.)\n\nFitz Makes an Executive Decision\n\nTony Goldwyn in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 2, Episode 13: \u2018Nobody Likes Babies\u2019\n\nIt took about a year for \u201cScandal\u201d to become a cultural phenomenon, and one of the scenes that cemented its reputation as TV\u2019s twistiest drama came about midway through Season 2. Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn), the president of the United States and Olivia\u2019s sometime boyfriend, has narrowly survived an assassination attempt ordered by his former ally, Justice Verna Thornton of the United States Supreme Court (Debra Mooney). When Fitz visits the cancer-stricken judge in the hospital, she warns him that she\u2019s about to blow the whistle on a voter-fraud conspiracy that put him in the White House. So, the sitting president removes her oxygen mask and watches as she suffocates to death.\n\nSally Commits a Sin\n\nKate Burton in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 3, Episode 9: \u2018YOLO\u2019\n\nFitz\u2019s original vice president, Sally Langston (Kate Burton), is a piece of work. A born-again Christian who delivers operatic sermons against homosexuality, Sally eventually learns that her husband, Daniel Douglas Langston (Jack Coleman), is sleeping with the spouse of Fitz\u2019s gay chief of staff. Curiously, it\u2019s also that chief of staff, Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry), whom she phones, her face spattered with blood, after fatally stabbing her husband with a letter opener in a fit of rage.\n\nJerry, We Hardly Knew Ye\n\nMadeline Carroll and Dylan Minnette in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 3, Episode 18: \u2018The Price of Free and Fair Elections\u2019\n\nMany deaths on \u201cScandal\u201d are genuinely upsetting. But, every once in a while, a minor character drops dead in entertainingly bizarre fashion. Such is the fate of Fitz\u2019s teenage son, Jerry Grant Jr. (Dylan Minnette), in the show\u2019s third season finale. Onstage at an event for his father\u2019s re-election campaign, he suddenly sneezes blood, his eyes roll back in his head, and he collapses, a victim of murder by meningitis poisoning. And that\u2019s it for Jerry. It\u2019s a tragedy for the Grants, of course, but it plays as pure camp.\n\n0\n\nRead more: Shonda Rhimes, the show\u2019s creator, and three of its stars discuss its twists, its nuanced handling of racial issues and its legacy.\n\nKidnapped!\n\nKerry Washington and Scott Foley in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 4, Episode 9: \u2018Where the Sun Don\u2019t Shine\u2019\n\nIn this, the last episode before the midseason hiatus in Season 4, \u201cScandal\u201d left viewers with quite the cliffhanger. Olivia has finally gotten out from under the thumb of her father, Eli Pope (Joe Morton) \u2014 no easy task, considering that he heads a top-secret spy agency. To celebrate her freedom, she and her other sometime boyfriend, Eli\u2019s rogue agent Jake Ballard (Scott Foley), decide to have sex on the piano in her living room. While Jake is in the bedroom grabbing a blanket, she disappears. Two months later, the next episode revealed that she had been kidnapped in a ploy to manipulate Fitz.\n\nThe Vice President Gets the Chair\n\nKerry Washington in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 5, Episode 17: \u2018Thwack!\u2019\n\nOlivia becomes a darker character after she is kidnapped, and late in Season 5, she exacts her long-awaited revenge on the man who subjected her to violence, humiliation and many consecutive bad hair days: Fitz\u2019s treacherous second vice president, Andrew Nichols (Jon Tenney). He knows that Fitz took the country to war over Olivia, and the job of bribing Andrew to keep that secret falls to her. When things get nasty, she starts bashing him over the head with a metal chair and doesn\u2019t stop until his skull is crushed.\n\nOlivia to Vice President: \u2018Kill Yourself\u2019\n\nFrom left, Tessie Santiago, Scott Foley and Kerry Washington in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 6, Episode 16: \u2018Transfer of Power\u2019\n\nMellie Grant (Bellamy Young) begins her tenure in the White House as Fitz\u2019s cold, critical first lady. By the end of Season 6, they\u2019re divorced, and she is America\u2019s first female president. But Mellie only makes it to the Oval Office because her opponent, Frankie Vargas (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), is assassinated just after winning the election. It takes the entire season for Olivia to figure out that it was his widow, Luna (Tessie Santiago), who orchestrated the murder. The problem is that Luna is now Mellie\u2019s vice president. All of these developments are kooky, but even kookier is the fact that Olivia \u201chandles\u201d Luna by calmly persuading her to lethally poison herself.\n\nPapa Pope Does the Dinosaur\n\nJoe Morton in \u201cScandal.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 7, Episode 9: \u2018Good People\u2019\n\nThe magic of \u201cScandal\u201d isn\u2019t only in the twists. Rhimes and her writers also have a knack for creating stand-alone spectacles that can make viewers wonder whether their eyes and ears are deceiving them. One such moment occurs in the show\u2019s seventh and final season, when Eli seems to lose his mind. The circumstances surrounding his apparent unraveling are complicated, but the bizarre and delightful experience of watching the dignified Joe Morton shimmy as he raps lines from Langston Hughes\u2019s \u201cI, Too\u201d at a tiny plastic dinosaur figurine requires no context.", "title": "Love \u2018Scandal\u2019?

Asked if she saw a film in it, she replied in English: \u201cImmediately!\u201d\n\nIf Ms. Martel\u2019s earlier work challenged reality, \u201cZama\u201d \u2014 a costume drama set in the late 18th century made for $3.5 million, a modest budget though more than double that of \u201cThe Headless Woman\u201d \u2014 is a movie in which the director challenged herself. She spent four years writing the script and raising money. (Eight nations helped produce the movie; among the many co-producers are Pedro and Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Danny Glover.) The shoot, which lasted a bit more than two months, was arduous, plagued by bad weather; postproduction was delayed by illness. (Ms. Martel has said she was treated for cancer and is reportedly in remission.)\n\nMs. Martel\u2019s first digitally shot film, her first set outside Salta, her first period film and her first adaptation, \u201cZama\u201d is also her first centered on a man, although, as she points out, the frustrated Don Diego de Zama, a South American-born functionary of imperial Spain posted in a remote Paraguayan backwater, resembles many of her female characters. Played by the Mexican actor Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho in a state of wounded dignity, Zama is a confused provincial, frustrated, self-deluded and clinging to a precarious sense of cultural superiority.\n\nAs the Kafkaesque drama of a man unable to get a transfer, \u201cZama\u201d shares the dislocation and torpor characteristic of the Salta Trilogy. But disconcertingly beautiful and at times otherworldly, the movie\u2019s spacey final movement recalls Werner Herzog adventures like \u201cAguirre, the Wrath of God\u201d and \u201cFitzcarraldo.\u201d Ms. Martel does not take this as a compliment. \u201cHis films bother me,\u201d she said, citing what she sees as their \u201cirresponsible treatment of animals and indigenous people.\u201d\n\nThe veteran Argentine film critic and festival director Eduardo Antin, who writes under the name Quintin, noted that however faithful to the Di Benedetto novel the film is, Ms. Martel made the material \u201cconsistent with her political interests\u201d by bringing \u201cthe background to the foreground.\u201d Di Benedetto focused on Zama and his would-be European milieu and largely ignored the colony\u2019s enslaved people and indigenous inhabitants. Martel includes Africans and Indians, most often women, in nearly every frame. Zama\u2019s story is also theirs. \u201cSuch a change requires great will and precise thinking,\u201d Mr. Antin wrote in an email. It also serves to set up the movie\u2019s horrifying \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d ending.\n\nMs. Martel hopes to return to Salta, where she has been working on a documentary about Javier Chocobar, an indigenous activist who was killed in a land dispute in 2008. \u201cThe history of our country is broken,\u201d she said, referring to Argentine identification with Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a conflict for every white man\u201d \u2014 and crucial to an understanding of the existential antihero Zama.", "title": "Lucrecia Martel: A Director Who Confounds and Thrills", "authors": []}

But last July, he was convicted of corruption and money laundering, and sentenced to almost 10 years in prison. In January, an appeals court unanimously upheld the conviction and increased the sentence to 12 years.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. da Silva, who served as president from 2003 to 2011, appealed the sentence to the country\u2019s top court, the Supreme Federal Court, asking to be allowed to remain free while additional appeals are pending \u2014 a process that could drag on for years.\n\nThat forced the justices to wrestle with a question with far-reaching implications for scores of other powerful figures ensnared in the large-scale corruption investigation known as Car Wash, including the current president, Michel Temer: At what point in the appeals process may a defendant be imprisoned?\n\nOn Thursday, the court gave its answer: It decided to maintain the status quo, which holds that defendants can be imprisoned after an appeals court upholds a verdict against them. With the ruling in hand, S\u00e9rgio Moro, the federal judge who presided over Mr. da Silva\u2019s trial, is expected to issue an arrest warrant for the former president in a matter of days.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think the fight will be easy,\u201d Mr. da Silva told supporters at a rally in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. if we lose one round, but we cannot lose our willingness to fight.\u201d\n\nProsecutors regard Mr. da Silva\u2019s case as the highest-stakes prosecution in their long crackdown on corruption, an effort that enjoys widespread support among Brazilians.\n\nIf the court had allowed Mr. da Silva to remain free, it would have enraged the crusading prosecutors and judges who have tried since 2014 to stamp out Brazil\u2019s entrenched culture of graft.\n\nThousands of the former president\u2019s critics demonstrated Tuesday night, demanding that the justices uphold their 2016 ruling that allows trial judges to jail defendants after a first appeal has been rejected. More than 5,000 prosecutors and judges have signed a petition supporting that position.\n\nBut Mr. da Silva still commands the loyalty of millions of Brazilians. His supporters contend that removing the country\u2019s most popular presidential candidate from the ballot would be an affront to democracy. They say the case against him is nothing more than political persecution, and they vowed to take to the streets if the court ruled he can be imprisoned.\n\nBefore the ruling, Chief Justice Rocha called for calm in a rare televised speech.\n\n\u201cWe are living in times of intolerance and intransigence,\u201d she said. \u201cThe strengthening of Brazilian democracy depends on civic unity for the peaceful coexistence of everyone.

Instead, a different body \u2014 the Supreme Electoral Tribunal \u2014 will review each candidate\u2019s eligibility forms starting in mid-August. It is widely expected to reject Mr. da Silva\u2019s bid for office under the \u201cclean slate\u201d law, which disqualifies anyone who has a criminal conviction that has been upheld by an appeals court.\n\nLegal experts say that Mr. da Silva could try to fight the electoral court\u2019s ruling if he remained free, but that his imprisonment makes that quest all but impossible.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If it is what it seems, another 1964 would be unacceptable,\u201d he said, referring to the coup that ushered in Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut many others backed the army chief.

He was not involved in the pembrolizumab study.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally, causing 1.7 million deaths a year. In the United States, it is expected to kill more than 154,000 people in 2018.\n\nPatients in the study had an advanced stage of non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The immune-activating drug was a checkpoint inhibitor called pembrolizumab, or Keytruda, made by Merck, which paid for the study. The chemotherapy was a drug called pemetrexed, plus either carboplatin or cisplatin.\n\nDr. Gandhi said chemotherapy alone had only a \u201cmodest benefit,\u201d and could add only a few months of life, with most patients surviving about a year or less. The combination treatment is a significant improvement, she said. It is already approved as a first-line treatment for this disease, so it should be covered by health insurers.\n\nShe was scheduled to present the results on Monday in Chicago at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, and they were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nOther studies presented at the meeting also highlighted advances in immunotherapy against lung cancer, but were at earlier points in the research and less likely to bring about immediate changes in medical practice.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see long-term survival, you\u2019ve got to give immunotherapy as soon as possible,\u201d Dr. Herbst said. \u201cChemotherapy has limitations. Immunotherapy has the ability to cure. I lead the Yale lung team.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOther studies in lung cancer have involved another checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, or Opdivo (made by Bristol-Myers Squibb), which works in a similar way to pembrolizumab. The data are not conclusive, but Dr. Herbst said, \u201cIn lung cancer, my suspicion is these drugs are the same, like Coke vs. Pepsi.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost patients stay on the drugs for two years, he said. One Yale patient who has survived for eight years took the drug for two years and has remained well ever since. Another had to stop because of side effects after two or three months, but is well two years later.\n\nDr. Herbst offered several theories about why chemotherapy and immunotherapy could work well together. He said that tumor cells were like bags of hidden proteins that, if exposed, the immune system could use as targets to find and attack cancer. By killing some tumor cells, chemotherapy could pop open the bags, release the contents and help immune cells \u2014 unleashed by the checkpoint drugs \u2014 to identify their prey. It is also possible, he said, that chemotherapy may kill some immune cells that interfere with the cancer-killing action of other parts of the immune system.\n\nDr. Gandhi\u2019s study included 616 patients with advanced lung cancer, ages 34 to 84, from medical centers in 16 countries. Their tumors lacked certain mutations that would have made them eligible for other, so-called \u201ctargeted\u201d treatments. They were picked at random to receive either chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, or chemotherapy plus a placebo, with two thirds receiving the combination that included immunotherapy.\n\nAfter a median follow-up of 10.5 months, those in the immunotherapy group were half as likely to die. The median overall survival was 11.3 months in those who did not receive immunotherapy, whereas survival in the immunotherapy group was longer and the median has not yet been reached.\n\nBut patients in the immunotherapy group had more kidney problems, more immune-related adverse events and were more likely to stop treatment because of side effects.\n\nThe estimated survival at 12 months was 69.2 percent in the group that received immunotherapy, and 49.4 percent in those who did not.\n\n\u201cI think we were all surprised at the magnitude of benefit and how clear the difference was at an early analysis, and that we could tell there was an overall survival difference,\u201d Dr. Gandhi said, adding that there was \u201ca lot of excitement\u201d at the conference about her study and several others involving immunotherapy.\n\n\u201cIt represents a sea change in the way we think about treating lung cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of it is better than what we\u2019ve been using for years. Going forward, it will only get better.\u201d\n\nPatients were tested for a biomarker used to predict whether pembrolizumab is likely to help them. The drug alone is already approved to treat patients with high levels of those markers. But this study included patients with varying levels. Those with high levels of the marker fared somewhat better with immunotherapy than those with low levels \u2014 but even those with low levels were helped.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe data are impressive,\u201d Dr. Herbst said. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress, but still only benefiting 30 to 40 percent of patients.

Brian Burke, the center\u2019s managing director. \u201cHowever, if mass transit is going to use it, they would need to pilot it in their own environment.\u201d\n\nThe eight-month study, which tested the technology at the university\u2019s underground tunnel system used by students to get around during winter months, found that ultra-wideband could measure distance precisely within about four inches. The report recommended studying whether the signal could be affected by the size of trains and interference from passengers\u2019 cellphones, among other potential issues.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using it within a mass transit system, you have to be precise 100 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Burke said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince late last year, the M.T.A. has been testing ultra-wideband radio on test tracks on the Culver Line in Brooklyn and on the shuttle that runs between Times Square and Grand Central Station, subway officials said. They are testing equipment from several vendors, including Metrom Rail.\n\nMr. Byford said he wants to study the new technology while moving quickly to upgrade signals on crowded routes like the Lexington Avenue line using the traditional approach.\n\n\u201cI want to use proven technology to deliver improvements quickly while ultra-wideband is tested and proven in parallel in another area,\u201d Mr. Byford said in a statement.\n\nJoe Pesaturo, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which runs Boston\u2019s subway, said the agency had tested ultra-wideband radio on its Green Line and planned to award a contract this summer for a new train-protection system on the line that could incorporate the technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Boston or New York embraces the technology, other transit systems could follow. But subway officials in New York have often been cautious to be the first to adapt new technology because they oversee the nation\u2019s largest subway, with nearly six million daily riders. Any hiccups could have a huge impact.\n\nThe M.T.A.\u2019s effort to upgrade signals has been plagued by problems. Only one line \u2014 the L train \u2014 has a modern signal system, known as communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C., after nearly two decades of work. A similar plan for the No. 7 line has been repeatedly delayed and might finally be completed by the end of the year.\n\nMr. Barone, of the Regional Plan Association, said that signal work could be done more quickly if the M.T.A. truly makes it a priority. But that would also mean that riders would have to tolerate longer station closures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time focusing on this one little piece,\u201d Mr. Barone said of ultra-wideband radio. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this one little piece. It\u2019s about streamlining the process so that we can install this system fast.\u201d\n\nFacing a subway crisis and a demanding Mr. Cuomo, the M.T.A. has started to take chances on newer technology. Officials quickly installed countdown clocks using Bluetooth receivers, which has led to many complaints about their accuracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the installation of a countdown clock \u2014 it works but it\u2019s not all that accurate,\u201d Mr. Barone said. \u201cWhen it comes to the train operation, it\u2019s a much higher standard.\u201d", "title": "M.T.A.

{"date": "2018-04-23 00:00:00", "text": "PARIS \u2014 On April 23, 2017, Emmanuel Macron stunned the world by leading in the first round of a presidential election that had looked unwinnable by him. He went on to win the second round and carry his movement, En Marche!, to a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. France, the new young president promised, was finally ready to be transformed and would soon be fit for the 21st century.\n\nA year after his first victory, the French president is on a state visit to Washington, and is a changed man. He has turned 40 and has toured the world, where he can still bask in appreciation. At home, though, the glory is largely gone. The president, who prides himself on talking the talk and walking the walk, has been pushing reforms at a dizzying pace since he arrived in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. But his fellow countrymen also like to walk their walk \u2014 a very different one. True to their reputation, they have taken to the streets to protest and resist changes organized from the top. It has taken a full year for President Macron to meet his moment of truth.\n\nSpring is in the air and strikes are back, as are anniversaries. One anniversary in particular is on some people\u2019s minds: May \u201968, which is widely seen here as a cultural revolution. Those protests started with a student rebellion at the Sorbonne in Paris; soon enough, the clashes spread and the students were joined by workers. Within weeks, a general strike paralyzed France and challenged President Charles de Gaulle. The general never fully recovered. He resigned the following year after losing a referendum.\n\nIs French revolutionary fervor back? In 1968, Mr. Macron had not yet been born, but he does know what \u201cconvergence des luttes\u201d means. Literally a \u201cconvergence of struggles,\u201d this slogan epitomized the unity of bourgeois students and the proletariat that made 1968 unique. Fifty years later, some people at the far ends of the French political spectrum still dream of its magic. Indeed, there\u2019s no shortage of protest in France this spring, putting Mr. Macron\u2019s reformist agenda to the test.", "title": "Opinion | Macron Meets His Moment of Truth", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-22 00:00:00", "text": "And the verdict on the French president\u2019s subtle calculus toward Mr. Trump is distinctly mixed. Almost alone among Europe\u2019s leaders, Mr. Macron has struck an apparent rapport with the mercurial American president, who has taken pride in testing, even alienating, some of the United States\u2019 oldest and truest allies.\n\nMr. Macron has made a gamble, given Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity, that he can court him but not be tarnished by him \u2014 or even that he can burnish his own reputation as a leader who is so psychologically astute that he can gain the ear of an American president who is in many respects his polar opposite.\n\nA year into a sustained charm offensive, Mr. Macron has won a trip to Washington, occasioned by an invitation from Mr. Trump for a formal state visit, the first the American leader has extended during his presidency.\n\nBut other than that, he has little to show for his courtship of Mr. Trump. Mr. Macron has gotten \u201cnothing\u201d was the unsparing judgment of Denis Lacorne, who teaches at Sciences-Po in Paris and is among the most seasoned observers of Franco-American relations.\n\nMr. Macron pitched hard to bring Mr. Trump around on climate change, the antinuclear proliferation deal with Iran and trade tariffs on steel and aluminum, Mr. Lacorne noted.\n\nVideo\n\nBut the American president withdrew from the Paris climate accord; is on the verge of abandoning the Iran deal and potentially could force the Europeans to leave it, as well; and is moving ahead with tariffs on aluminum and steel that will hurt some European allies.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see concrete results,\u201d said Laurence Nardon, the director of the North America program at the French Institute of International Relations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Macron, in her view, may get something intangible. \u201cWhat Macron gets is that he is seen as being close to the U.S. and even to Trump, and that gives his presidency and France bigger clout,\u201d Ms. Nardon said.\n\nMr. Macron has built a career out of offering respectful, flattering attention to older power figures. Mr. Trump is only the latest in a succession of such men \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the former French president; Jacques Attali, a former presidential counselor \u2014 Mr. Macron has cleverly used and then leapfrogged over.\n\nThe French leader had the insight that Mr. Trump would be thrilled by the military might, pomp and circumstance of France\u2019s annual Bastille Day Parade, with its show of military hardware, and invited him to share a front-row seat last July.\n\nMr. Trump was so taken with it, he ordered up one of his own for this year, now tentatively scheduled for Nov. 11, Veterans Day, but with details still in flux.\n\nThe French president also took Mr. Trump and his wife to dinner in a formal restaurant in the Eiffel Tower, a canny recognition of Mr. Trump\u2019s attraction to glitz.\n\nNo one should confuse Mr. Macron\u2019s attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s likes and dislikes with a genuine bromance, however, and Mr. Macron\u2019s staff bristles at the suggestion that the two are friends.\n\nAsked at a media luncheon about purported closeness between the two leaders, Benjamin Griveaux, the government\u2019s spokesman, responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think they are buddies. The goal is not to have affectionate relations, but to establish some sort of personal connection.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron himself makes selective criticisms of Mr. Trump as if to send a clear signal to the French that he is not na\u00efve. He said publicly that Mr. Trump had made a mistake to deride Haiti and African nations as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis tone in talking about the Iran nuclear nonproliferation pact and the Paris climate accord brushes aside Mr. Trump\u2019s positions. \u201cThere is no Plan B,\u201d his aides say of the Iran deal, echoing Mr. Macron\u2019s frequent comment about the climate pact, \u201cThere is no Planet B.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Janus-faced approach \u2014 at once warm and friendly to Mr. Trump but at the same time keeping his options open \u2014 in some ways reflects the French love-hate relationship with the United States.\n\nFrance disdains America\u2019s brashness and unilateralism but also admires its popular culture and the fluidity of a society where it is easier to rise to wealth and power than in France.\n\nIn foreign policy, France\u2019s independent line, forged by the former president and general Charles de Gaulle, was clearest in France\u2019s refusal to go along with the American invasion of Iraq.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Mr. Trump\u2019s breezy suggestions of acquiescence to the French point of view \u2014 on climate change, for instance \u2014 turned out to be no more substantive than the off-the-cuff way in which they were delivered.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSomething could happen with respect to the Paris accord,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Nothing ever did.\n\nThe risk, said Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political scientist who follows geopolitics closely and teaches at the University of Paris-East at Cr\u00e9teil, is that Mr. Macron gives too much to Mr. Trump and gets little in return.\n\n\u201cEmmanuel Macron doesn\u2019t risk being unpopular for trying to get things from Donald Trump and trying to negotiate with him,\u201d said Mr. Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe problem would come if, like Tony Blair, he tried to get things by developing a strong relationship with the U.S. president, but afterward got too little,\u201d said Mr. Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, referring to the former British prime minister who allied himself with President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to remove Saddam Hussein and found himself and his country mired in a yearslong war in Iraq.\n\nMr. Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, Ms. Nardon and other analysts say that Mr. Macron is taking advantage of the vacuum left in Europe by Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s preoccupation with how to get Britain out of the European Union and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s focus on maintaining an unwieldy coalition in Germany.\n\nIn a way, that fits well with the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cFrance\u2019s cooperation with the United States has always been pragmatic,\u201d said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, a senior trans-Atlantic fellow and director of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund.\n\n\u201cSo in a certain way, the French pragmatic way mirrors Trump\u2019s transactional approach,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s why they can succeed in getting along while they have very deep policy disagreements.\u201d\n\nIf the rhetoric is stripped away, Mr. Macron in fact has set rather modest goals, although the show of friendship with Mr. Trump can be distracting, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to keep the U.S. engaged in the international system, the multilateral system, and not give the U.S. the sense that the Europeans are trying to isolate Washington,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Macron will be in Washington for three days, with a State Dinner planned for Tuesday and a speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. Still, a senior aide at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e tried to lower expectations.\n\nIt would be a mistake to judge the success of the trip by what the French president could get from Mr. Trump, the aide said. Instead, the visit will allow time for the two leaders to luxuriate in the pomp and circumstance that they both enjoy and for them to talk in a more personal way with their wives present.\n\nIn a January television interview, Mr. Macron waxed about how the two men talked often and how he felt \u201cattached\u201d to Mr. Trump. But when the interviewer questioned how he could be friendly with the American president, Mr. Macron laid out his colder, strategic assessment.\n\n\u201cThe United States is the premier power; it is our most important partner in multilateral endeavors; it\u2019s our first partner in the fight against terrorism; it is important for collective security,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can be angry with the United States, we may disagree about the methods as we do on Iran, but at the end, we are in agreement,\u201d he said.", "title": "Macron Takes a Risk in Courting Trump, but Has Little to Show for It", "authors": ["Alissa J.

But Prime Minister Orban\u2019s easy win in Hungary\u2019s national election on April 8 and the success of antiestablishment parties in Italy a month earlier have signaled otherwise. To the east, Russia\u2019s brazen violation of international norms has only increased despite broad economic sanctions \u2014 witness the chemical assault on a double agent in Britain, while to the west, the Trump administration relentlessly pursues its chaotic assault on American values and traditions.\n\nMr. Macron said political change was inevitable, but it should not mean abandonment of democratic principles.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in these difficult times, European democracy is our best chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst possible mistake would be to give up on our model and our identity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe see authoritarians all around us, and the answer is not authoritarian democracy, but the authority of democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Macron is not without political weaknesses. He has been called \u201cJupiter\u201d for his haughty style, and his economic reforms at home are being challenged by a wave of strikes. His proposals for a closer financial convergence in the eurozone have been met with a cool response in Germany. Yet the French president is one of the rare European leaders who unabashedly believe in Europe\u2019s future, especially as Britain prepares to exit the European Union and America\u2019s leadership erodes. Though he has cultivated a strategic rapport with President Trump, providing French forces for the punitive strike on Syria last weekend, for example, Mr. Macron drew a distinction in his speech between Europe and an America that was \u201crejecting multilateralism, free trade and climate change.\u201d\n\nIt may be that the West is going through a temporary backlash against globalization, terrorism, migration, social upheavals and technological change that have swept so rapidly around the world, and that Mr. Macron is exaggerating when he sees a \u201ccertain European civil war\u201d in the political turmoil. Yet, in Hungary, Mr. Orban opened his fourth term as prime minister with a national hate campaign against George Soros, the Hungarian-American funder of liberal projects, and with plans for a legislative campaign against nongovernmental groups that help immigrants and refugees. Late last year the European Union formally put Poland on notice that its assault on the judiciary was a serious breach of union rules.

She was only a toddler when she and her parents, who were of Jewish descent but later converted to Catholicism, fled Czechoslovakia after Hitler\u2019s invasion in 1939. They returned following the war, but fled again in the wake of the Communist coup in 1948.\n\nHer father, the diplomat Josef Korbel, sought asylum for the family in the United States, writing in a letter to an American official that if they returned home he\u2019d be arrested \u201cfor my faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy.\u201d America took them in as refugees. Korbel became an eminent foreign policy scholar, and in 1997 Bill Clinton made Albright the country\u2019s chief diplomat, the first woman to hold that position.\n\nAt the time, the Cold War was over and the great ideological battles of the 20th century appeared settled. Liberal democracy was ascendant, and Albright\u2019s adopted country was its most powerful champion. The arc of her life seemed to coincide with a global evolution from widespread tyranny toward expanding freedom.\n\nSo it is sad and jarring that Albright, now 80, has just published a book with the stark title \u201cFascism: A Warning.\u201d The book is not just a warning about Donald Trump; Albright is concerned with the eclipse of liberal democracy all over the world and told me in a recent interview that she had planned to write on the subject before Trump\u2019s election. But the president looms over her project. \u201cIf we think of fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, putting Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab,\u201d she writes.", "title": "Opinion | Madeleine Albright Is Worried.

A coterie of men in a handful of top-tier executive roles, while the majority of entry-level, retail, design and distribution center jobs are held by women, creating a gendered, pyramid employment structure reflected across sectors in the fashion industry.\n\nTake Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications Limited, publisher of magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Glamour and GQ. The company reported data on Tuesday that revealed it to have the largest mean gender pay gap favoring men among all British media publishers and broadcasters, despite having more women than men at every pay quartile.\n\nThe company reported a mean gender pay gap of 36.9 percent (in other words, when comparing mean hourly rates, women earn 63 pence, or 83 cents, for every 1 pound, or $1.40, that men earn) and a median gap of 23 percent (when comparing median hourly rates, women earn 77 pence, or $1.08, for every \u00a31, or $1.40, that men earn).\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement published alongside the data, Cond\u00e9 Nast attributed its salary skew to its longstanding and male-dominated senior leadership team. The chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast Britain, Nicholas Coleridge, for example, has held various roles across the executive team since 1991. Jonathan Newhouse has led Cond\u00e9 Nast International for over 30 years.

In the Petit Trianon at Versailles, they have a mini tea set with little painted bugs.\u201d Indeed, the works of artists like Pieter Claesz, Jan van Kessel, Maria Sibylla Merian and Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp in the late 1600s often featured bountiful displays of fruit being overrun by insects, said to be symbols of the fleeting nature of beauty and the inevitability of decay. \u201cThere\u2019s an irony,\u201d says Armitano Domingo of his work. \u201cPeople think bugs aren\u2019t a good thing to have around food, but I always eat off my bug plate.\u201d It\u2019s also, perhaps, a vision of the future, when it is possible that we will all be eating caterpillars as protein when meatier options are endangered. \u201cMy parents are from Venezuela, and there I had a red ant sauce that was really spicy and nice,\u201d he says.\n\nThere is an alluring, if unnerving, sense of decay in Armitano Domingo\u2019s work, but it\u2019s only skin deep; the plates, he assures, are dependably sturdy because he uses a rare high-temperature gas kiln that reaches highs of around 2,300 degrees. \u201cI expect people to eat off of them!\u201d he says of his pieces. \u201cThey\u2019re just like every other plate you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Yes, except for the shimmering iridescent worms.", "title": "Maker to Know: A Ceramist Creating Insect-Adorned Plates", "authors": ["Alex Frank", "On The Verge"]}

Ajami predicted that the country\u2019s complicated history would prove difficult to reconcile. Syria is a religiously and ethnically diverse country composed primarily of Sunni Arabs and a sizable Christian minority, but since the 1970s, it has been ruled by the Assad family, who are members of a Shiite sect called Alawites that make up 12 percent of the population. Hafez al-Assad established a brutal regime from the onset of his reign, and a pivotal moment occurred in 1982, when he squashed an Islamic insurgency in the city of Hama, killing an estimated 30,000 people. When he died in 2000, his son, Bashar, inherited the throne.

Living isolated in the woods, a couple and their children have crafted a very hushed existence to keep the threat at bay: they walk barefoot, communicate via sign language, and play Monopoly with cotton game pieces.\n\nWhen characters have to keep mum to stay alive, sound design can go to some innovative places. Anxious moments are created from the slightest creaks of a floor, footsteps on sand or even a heartbeat. Being inventive with sound, and frequently with the absence of it, was the idea that propelled the director, John Krasinski, who also stars in the movie with his wife, Emily Blunt.\n\n[Read our review of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d]\n\n\u201cWe live in a world now where you see all these movies, like Marvel movies, and there\u2019s so much sound going on, so many explosions,\u201d Mr. Krasinski said during an interview in New York. \u201cI love those movies, but there\u2019s something about all that noise that assaults you, in a way.

Would that make it feel just as disconcerting and just as uncomfortable and tense?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTo help make quiet frightening, Mr. Krasinski worked with the sound editors Ethan Van Der Ryn and Erik Aadahl, who have experience with the loud (\u201cGodzilla\u201d) and the louder (\u201cTransformers\u201d), but were interested in taking things down more than a few notches.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey worked to create what they called \u201csound envelopes,\u201d putting audiences in a character\u2019s shoes to hear what they hear and how they might hear it. The most intriguing one was for the young Regan, who is deaf and played by the deaf actress Millicent Simmonds. Regan wears a cochlear implant that gives her extremely minimal hearing; she has more of a physical sense of presence than an auditory one. For that, the editors wanted to mimic the feeling of being in an anechoic chamber, a room that absorbs sound to the point where all you can hear are the heightened noises of your own body. Regan\u2019s envelope is rendered with a kind of low, muffled feel punctuated by the gentle pulse of her heart.

Both said they had noticed that Ms. Ortega was upset in the weeks before the murders but saw no indication she was losing her mind.\n\nBefore her arrest, Ms. Ortega had never been hospitalized for psychiatric problems; the only medical record regarding her mental health was one page of notes from a psychologist she visited three days before the crime. The therapist, Thomas Caffrey, said he saw no signs of delusional or psychotic thinking. He determined she was suffering from depression and anxiety. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me about any concerns about voices or visions,\u201d he testified.\n\nLacking medical records, the defense team relied on testimony from Ms. Ortega\u2019s family members and friends to show that she had had two mental breakdowns in the Dominican Republic, one in 1978 after her young sister died and a second in 2008 after a close family friend committed suicide.\n\nIn both cases, she slipped into deep depression and refused to leave her family\u2019s house, her sisters and friends said.

Most doctors agree that a subset of users benefit from a lifetime prescription, but disagree over how large the group is.\n\nDr. Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and author of several books about antidepressants, said that while he generally works to wean patients with mild-to-moderate depression off medication, some report that they do better on it.\n\n\u201cThere is a cultural question here, which is how much depression should people have to live with when we have these treatments that give so many a better quality of life,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a question that should be decided in advance.\u201d\n\nAntidepressants are not harmless; they commonly cause emotional numbing, sexual problems like a lack of desire or erectile dysfunction and weight gain. Long-term users report in interviews a creeping unease that is hard to measure: Daily pill-popping leaves them doubting their own resilience, they say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to a place, at least in the West, where it seems every other person is depressed and on medication,\u201d said Edward Shorter, a historian of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. \u201cYou do have to wonder what that says about our culture.\u201d\n\nPatients who try to stop taking the drugs often say they cannot.

Nearly half who tried to quit could not do so because of these symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn another study of 180 longtime antidepressant users, withdrawal symptoms were reported by more than 130.

It lists headaches, fatigue and insomnia, among other reactions in patients trying to stop.\n\nThe few studies of antidepressant withdrawal that have been published suggest that it is harder to get off some medications than others. This is due to differences in the drugs\u2019 half-life \u2014 the time it takes the body to clear the medication once the pills are stopped.\n\nBrands with a relatively short half-life, like Effexor and Paxil, appear to cause more withdrawal symptoms more quickly than those that stay in the system longer, like Prozac.\n\nIn one of the earliest published withdrawal studies, researchers at Eli Lilly had people taking Zoloft, Paxil or Prozac stop the pills abruptly, for about a week. Half of those on Paxil experienced serious dizziness; 42 percent suffered confusion; and 39 percent, insomnia.\n\nAmong patients who stopped taking Zoloft, 38 percent had severe irritability; 29 percent experienced dizziness; and 23 percent, fatigue. The symptoms appeared soon after people were taken off the drugs and resolved once they resumed taking the pills.\n\nThose on Prozac, by contrast, experienced no initial spike in symptoms when they stopped, but this result was not surprising. It takes Prozac several weeks to wash out of the body entirely, so one week\u2019s interruption is not a test of withdrawal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a study of Cymbalta, another Eli Lilly drug, people in withdrawal experienced two to three symptoms on average. The most common were dizziness, nausea, headache and paresthesia \u2014 electric-shock sensations in the brain that many people call brain zaps. Most of these symptoms lasted longer than two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the state of the science is absolutely inadequate,\u201d said Dr. Derelie Mangin, a professor in the department of family medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information about what antidepressant withdrawal entails, so we can\u2019t design proper tapering approaches.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, dozens of people who had experienced antidepressant withdrawal recounted similar stories: The drugs often relieved mood problems, at first.

Mr. Needham has been a leading practitioner of the uncompromising, scorched-earth style of political combat that was a trademark of Tea Party-inspired politicians and activists. He frequently clashed with the Republican leadership in Congress and challenged it to drive a harder bargain on issues like defunding the Affordable Care Act, which led to a two-week government shutdown in 2013 that most Republicans came to see as ill advised.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He has worked with Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, on immigration reform. And he remains close to his party\u2019s Senate leaders. His bid for president had the backing of some of the Republican Party\u2019s most establishment-friendly \u2014 and anti-Trump \u2014 donors.\n\nMr. Needham and Mr. Rubio have often had very different things to say about Mr. Trump. Given his anti-establishment sensibilities, Mr. Needham has largely lauded the president\u2019s agenda of low taxes and a hard-line posture toward China. He has praised Mr. Trump for helping the Republican Party forge a stronger bond with Americans who feel socially and economically disconnected and who are eager to shine a light on the corruption and cronyism they believe is rampant in Washington.\n\nMr. Rubio, who has been running for office more or less since he was a West Miami city commissioner in his 20s, clashed bitterly and personally with Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. He denounced Mr. Trump as someone who operated from the same playbook as \u201cthird-world strongmen\u201d who ruled Latin America. He said Mr. Trump had preyed on vulnerable students by selling them worthless degrees from Trump University. In one of the more memorable but desperate moments of Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign, he also ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to misspell things on Twitter and suggested he once wet his pants at a debate.\n\nLately, however, Mr. Rubio has done what many other Republicans have done and tried to work with the president on the parts of his agenda that they do not find objectionable. He won concessions from the White House to make the child tax credit more generous in last year\u2019s tax overhaul.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe senator has also been generally supportive of the president\u2019s efforts to punish China for what they say is its disadvantaging of American products and causing of job losses with unfair trade practices.\n\nMr. Needham and Mr. Rubio both agree there is a need now to work with the president as much as possible while also looking beyond him to plan for what the party and the country look like once he is gone.\n\n\u201cAs someone who\u2019s lived his career in the movement, the challenge is preserving the principles that Reagan fought for while also being able to refresh that pool of ideas to keep pace with our times,\u201d Mr. Needham said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger effort than any one president or any one person.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio\u2019s chief of staff position has been vacant since January, when he fired the previous occupant of the job after allegations of inappropriate conduct surfaced.", "title": "Marco Rubio, Darling of G.O.P.

{"date": "2018-04-11 00:00:00", "text": "READ MORE:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg was the only technology chief in the room on Tuesday, but he was often treated as a stand-in for the whole industry.\n\n\u2022 The public scolding on Capitol Hill may do little to change how Facebook powers its $40.6 billion business: meticulously monitoring what you do online. Here\u2019s how they do it.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Zuckerberg wore a suit and tie to testify before Congress instead of his usual gray T-shirt. One might say it was his \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d suit.\n\n\u2022 The hearings were prompted by a scandal over data harvesting by a third-party organization. Fallout from the scandal has dealt a blow to the political clout of the Mercers, the conservative donors behind organization.\n\nRegulating the use of private data\n\nRepresentative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d\n\nMr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\n\nLater in the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg said regulation was \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he repeated that the right kind of regulation mattered and he pointed out that some regulation could only solidify the power of a large company like Facebook, which could hurt start-ups.\n\nOn Tuesday, several senators sounded a similar tune, saying Facebook couldn\u2019t be trusted with the vast amounts of data being collected, much of which was being done without users\u2019 full understanding. Three senators introduced privacy legislation that would require users\u2019 permission to collect and share their data.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to agree to privacy legislation that requires permission for data collection. Mr. Zuckerberg demurred and did not express support for any specific legislative proposal.\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data.\n\n\u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\n\nThe concern was echoed by Representative Bobby L. Rush, a Democrat of Illinois, who pointed a finger at Mr. Zuckerberg and asked: \u201cWhy is the onus on the user to opt in to privacy and security settings?\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg also did not dismiss a proposal from Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California, to create a digital consumer protection agency that would subject Facebook and its peers to some degree of government involvement.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg called the idea one \u201cthat deserves a lot of consideration\u201d but said that the \u201cdetails on this really matter.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nCould Europe\u2019s privacy laws serve as a model?\n\nLast week, Mr. Zuckerberg made a promise. He said that Facebook planned to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis morning, Representatives Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed him repeatedly on the issue. And Mr. Zuckerberg repeated his commitment to give all users those controls.\n\nBut European regulators and privacy advocates said over the last week that a number of Facebook\u2019s current practices seemed violate the new law, called the General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nFor one thing, the European law requires privacy by design and default. European experts said that, in their view, that would require Facebook turn off a number of advertising and privacy settings which are currently set to sharing and instead ask user permission to turn them on.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg answered the legislators\u2019 questions by saying that the company plans to put a tool \u201cat the top of everyone\u2019s app\u201d where users will be able to make privacy and sharing choices. But the company may not offer affirmative consent \u2014 asking users to explicitly opt-in \u2014 in every country, depending on legal issues, he said.\n\nFacebook currently allows users to download a copy of their personal data like their messages, likes and posts.\n\nBut Mr. Green wanted to know if Facebook would comply with the European law \u2014 and extend those protections to users worldwide \u2014 by providing individuals with the complete records and profiles the Facebook has compiled on them. That would include any data the company collected about its users by tracking them on other websites, and any data the company bought or acquired from third parties about users, and any categorizations or algorithmic scores Facebook created about users, regulators said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said he believed all of the data is available.\n\nThat isn\u2019t true for the moment \u2014 at least for a couple of reporters who recently downloaded their Facebook data. But Facebook has about six weeks to figure out how to give users a copy of their algorithmic scores, web tracking data and other records the social network has compiled before the law goes into effect in Europe.\n\nThe uses of facial recognition technology\n\nFacial recognition \u2014 a technology that scans your face and converts into a mathematical code that can be used to identify you in any other facial photo or video still \u2014 is a hot-button topic on both sides of the Atlantic. That is because it involves measuring and collecting data about people\u2019s unique physical attributes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFacebook uses the technology in a name-tagging feature that can automatically suggest the names of people in users\u2019 photographs. But regulators in Europe have cracked down on Facebook for rolling it out without users\u2019 explicit opt-in consent. And privacy groups in the United States filed a complaint last week to the Federal Trade Commission saying Facebook\u2019s recent expanded use of the technology violated a settlement the company made with the agency in 2011.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Only Snapchat and Pandora are independent.\n\nCambridge Analytica and Russia\u2019s election interference\n\nLawmakers pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook didn\u2019t inform users about the harvesting of user data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, in 2015, when it was informed of the data abuse.\n\nMr. Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat, chided Mr. Zuckerberg for his company\u2019s na\u00efvet\u00e9 in not realizing how Facebook data could be utilized.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those, like Russia and Cambridge Analytica, that seek to harm us and hack our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers have pointed out to Mr. Zuckerberg, repeatedly, that the Obama campaign used a Facebook app to also scrape data from users and their friends in 2012.\n\nBut those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for.\n\nThe app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.\n\nAsked whether Facebook will sue the researcher who created the app, Aleksandr Kogan, or Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Zuckerberg said \u201cit\u2019s something we\u2019re looking into.\u201d\n\nPartisan bias and Facebook\u2019s responsibility as a publisher\n\nRepresentative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, zeroed in on a line of questioning that his Texas counterpart in the Senate, Ted Cruz, also asked, pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk.\n\nMr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform,\u201d a question also asked by Mr. Cruz.\n\n\u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers returned several times to the issue of bias on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise of Louisiana questioned whether Facebook\u2019s newsfeed algorithms tamp down conservative news in favor of more left-leaning outlets, to which Mr. Zuckerberg responded that \u201cthere is absolutely no directive\u201d to have \u201cany kind of bias in anything we do.\u201d\n\nThe proliferation of so-called fake news has put Mr. Zuckerberg in an awkward spot, as the company promises to do a better job of weeding out propaganda and falsehoods but insists it cannot police free speech.\n\nOut in the hall during a break in the hearing, Representative Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, also expressed frustration about Facebook\u2019s treatment of Diamond and Silk, two pro-Trump video personalities who have complained about being censored by the platform.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they take down a lot more conservative content than they do liberal,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Long said that he needed more answers about the Diamond and Silk situation, and that he hoped Mr. Zuckerberg could ensure that the company\u2019s thousands of moderators weren\u2019t biased against conservatives.\n\n\u201cHe better hope he does it, not us,\u201d Mr. Long added. \u201cOr Congress is going to get involved, and regulate a private industry.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of company is Facebook?\n\nMr. Walden of Oregon foreshadowed a line of questioning for Mr. Zuckerberg on how Facebook works and if the social media site has become a publisher or utility service that deserves regulation.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d Mr. Walden asked, listing industries like advertising, publishing and even telecom, or \u201ccommon carrier in the information age.\u201d\n\nThe definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\n\nFacebook, he said, is not a software company, despite creating software. It is not an aerospace company, even though it builds planes. It is not a financial institution, although it offers payment tools for users.\n\n\u201cDo we have a responsibility for the content people share on Facebook? I think the answer to that question is yes,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Day 2 Brings Tougher Questioning", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang", "Tiffany Hsu", "Kevin Roose", "Natasha Singer", "Matthew Rosenberg"]}
{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "Did Facebook deceive its users?\n\nSenator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, zeroed in on whether Facebook deceived consumers. She pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company made a decision not to inform users about the Cambridge Analytica episode when they learned in 2015 that data was sold by a researcher to the political consulting firm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about notification of users. And this relates to the issue of transparency and the issue of trust: informing users of what you know in terms of how their personal information was misused,\u201d Ms. Harris said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Zuckerberg did not admit that the company explicitly decided to withhold that information from consumers, but he said the company made a mistake in not informing users.\n\nThe question was key to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Facebook\u2019s violation of a 2011 consent decree. If the company withheld information, which would be a deceptive act, the company could face record fines for violating its promises to the agency.\n\nThe tough questions by Ms. Harris, were closely watched because she is from the San Francisco Bay Area and is seen as a rising political star within the Democratic Party.\n\n\u2014 Cecilia Kang\n\nDemocrats press on Russian meddling\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on Russia\u2019s exploitation of the platform during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg admitted that the company\u2019s effort to find and stop the Russian meddling was \u201cslow,\u201d and called that failure \u201cone of my greatest regrets.\u201d He said Facebook was tracking known Russian hacking groups in real time but took much longer to recognize the inflammatory posts of the Internet Research Agency, a private company with Kremlin ties.\n\n\u201cThere are people in Russia whose job is to exploit our systems,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cThis is an arms race.\u201d\n\nBut the Facebook founder said the company deployed new artificial intelligence tools to detect malicious activity in elections in France, Italy and a special Senate race in Alabama. He said he believed the new technology would help protect the integrity of elections around the world from manipulation via Facebook.\n\n\u2014 Scott Shane\n\nVideo\n\nBooker raised concerns about racial targeting\n\nSenator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, questioned Mr. Zuckerberg over discriminatory uses of Facebook\u2019s advertising platform to target ads to users by race, and tools that law enforcement officials have reportedly used to surveil activists of color.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s questioning is notable given that he and Mr. Zuckerberg have a history of friendly collaboration dating back to 2010, when Mr. Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the public school system in Newark, where Mr. Booker was mayor at the time.\n\nMr. Booker has long been seen as a tech-friendly lawmaker, and he has known Mr. Zuckerberg for longer than most lawmakers. His tough stance today is a sign of how dramatically the political winds around Facebook have shifted.\n\n\u2014 Kevin Roose\n\nAs Zuckerberg was being grilled, Facebook\u2019s stock price jumped\n\nEarly impressions of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony were positive.

It\u2019s just that it is seemingly possible to count on two hands the times he has done so: always on public occasions and (not counting his wedding) always when heads of state or other dignitaries are involved. He wore a suit, for example, to address the G8 summit in France in 2011; to the state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015; to interview Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Facebook the same year; and to testify in a Dallas courtroom during the Oculus intellectual property trial in 2017.\n\nStill, it is such a rarity that former President Barack Obama made a joke out of it in a 2011 Facebook Town Hall, referring to an earlier meeting and calling himself \u201cthe guy who got Mark to wear a jacket and tie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd though we know the utterly plain gray cotton T-shirts and hoodies Mr. Zuckerberg favors are not nearly as simple as they seem \u2014 they come from Brunello Cucinelli, an Italian brand that specializes in what might be called utopian casual, and begin at about $295 (for the tee) \u2014 it\u2019s a mystery where he gets his suits.\n\nMuch was written about his wife\u2019s wedding dress after their wedding, but there was little about his dark suit. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on his choice of suit for Congress. Mr. Rosenfeld said he had no idea of the maker or whether Mr. Zuckerberg was getting outside advice.

But over the years Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s suits have gotten skinnier, the ties narrower, the aesthetic less uncomfortable-kid-in-Dad\u2019s-borrowed-suit.\n\nThat makes sense. Mr. Zuckerberg understands the role of image in communication. Facebook is, after all, a platform built largely on pictures. As Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist and Silicon Valley billionaire, wrote in his 2014 book, \u201cZero to One\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 that tech workers don\u2019t care about what they wear.\u201d He went on: \u201cEverybody from slackers to yuppies carefully \u2018curates\u2019 their outward appearance.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCertainly Mr. Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged, a few times, the very conscious way he uses clothes. Just because he is known for wearing the same thing every day doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t think about fashion or how what he wears gets interpreted. In fact, it is exactly the opposite.\n\nHis Facebook timeline of \u201cLife Events\u201d includes the milestone \u201cWore a tie for a year\u201d in 2009, along with \u201cbecame a vegetarian\u201d (in 2011) and \u201cMarried Priscilla Chan\u201d (2012).\n\n\u201cI wanted to signal to everyone at Facebook that this was a serious year for us,\u201d he wrote in an post about the tie wearing. \u201cMy tie was the symbol of how serious and important a year this was, and I wore it every day to show this.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2014, during a Facebook Town Hall, he was asked about the gray tees, and responded: \u201cI really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community. And there\u2019s actually a bunch of psychology theory that even making small decisions around what you wear, or what you eat for breakfast, or things like that, they kind of make you tired and consume your energy.\u201d\n\nWhich is to say, he wears the same thing because that way he thought about it once and never had to think about it again.\n\nThough the current situation does somewhat demonstrate the limits of that approach.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry Suit", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"]}

They are considering 30 to 50 people, he said, among them, Richard Wright, whose autobiography, \u201cBlack Boy,\u201d is a coming-of-age story in the Jim Crow South; and the poet Margaret Walker Alexander, who was born in Birmingham, Ala., but lived in Jackson on a street named for her. The first of the markers will be unveiled in August during the 2018 Mississippi Book Festival.\n\nMr. White said he had a number of conversations with Richard Ford, the Pulitzer Prize winner, about whether the author wanted to commemorate his childhood home in Jackson. The author grew up in the same neighborhood as Ms. Welty, and they attended the same high school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like sacred ground for Mississippi literature,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cI thought he would want his marker there.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Ford, though, had other ideas. In the mid-1980s, the novelist, a former sportswriter, lived in Clarksdale, a small town in the Mississippi Delta 150 miles from Jackson. There, he spent days at the Carnegie Public Library writing \u201cThe Sportswriter,\u201d his 1986 novel about a failed fiction writer turned sportswriter whose son dies. (He followed it up with the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cIndependence Day\u201d in 1995.) In the end, Mr. Ford wanted his marker at the library in Clarksdale, not his childhood home.\n\n\u201cThe Delta is where I chose to live,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cCarnegie Library is a refuge. They offered me a haven. I want to be remembered in a place where people could go read books. Literature can be a way for society to address what it doesn\u2019t want to address.\u201d\n\nOne of those issues is systemic racism, which persists in America despite the gains made in the 1960s. Mr. Ford, who now lives in Maine, said he recently taught a class in which students had neither read nor heard of \u201cBlack Boy,\u201d Mr. Wright\u2019s seminal work that painted a grim picture of race relations when it was published in 1945.\n\n\u201cI have no right to be surprised,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cBut that is a book people need to read so that historical anomalies will not be allowed to persist.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Ward grew up in Delisle, a small rural community not far from Biloxi.

His neck and shoulders where heavily muscled, but his hands were almost delicate.\n\nSpeaker of Few Gestures\n\nThere was little of the rabblerouser in his oratory. He was not prone to extravagant gestures or loud peroration. His baritone voice, though vibrant, was not that of a spellbinder.

Blackstone\u2019s president at the time, Hamilton E. James, predicted that the fund would spur infrastructure projects that would \u201ccreate well-paying American jobs and will lay the foundation for stronger long-term economic growth.\u201d\n\nIn the joint Blackstone-Saudi news release, H.E. Yasir Al Rumayyan, the head of the Public Investment Fund, said that the $20 billion Saudi pledge \u201creflects our positive views around the ambitious infrastructure initiatives being undertaken in the United States as announced by President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe venture\u2019s $40 billion target drew skepticism from Blackstone\u2019s rival firms.

When Prince Mohammed was in New York last week, Mr. Schwarzman hosted a lunch for the prince at his New York home.\n\nBlackstone began contacting big institutional investors such as pension funds last spring as it sought contributions to the fund. But some balked at putting money in until Blackstone had a team in place to run the infrastructure fund, according to a person briefed on the process. Blackstone had promoted Sean Klimczak, a partner who had brokered previous infrastructure investments, to run the infrastructure group around the time of the fund\u2019s unveiling. Other hires took longer.\n\nBy February, the news release announcing the $40 billion fund had disappeared from Blackstone\u2019s website, although a version remained on the Public Investment Fund\u2019s site.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "What you do need to know is how to cook on low heat, which, in a modern kitchen, isn\u2019t as easy as you would think. Preindustrial recipes assume that you are cooking on a wood-fired or coal-fed stove; for a home cook, simmering a stew to tenderness could take hours or even days.\n\nFor most of my life as a cook, whether making a stew, a braise, a daube or a rag\u00f9, I found it impossible to sustain \u201cgentle\u201d cooking on my gas burners. All those delicious French words for simmering: mijoter, to murmur; fr\u00e9mir, to shiver; mitonner, to cook quietly, were out of my reach. All I could do was bouillir (boil).\n\nI\u2019d tiptoe away from a barely simmering stew \u2014 as from a baby who has finally gone to sleep \u2014 and be summoned back five minutes later to find a heaving, splattering mass. While some cooks are on an eternal quest for more B.T.U.s, hotter surfaces and bigger flames, I wish for the stovetop equivalent of a Sterno can.\n\nSo the first time I baked a stew in the oven, I felt as if someone had reinvented the wheel for me.\n\nWhen I made a Roman-style oxtail stew, baked in a tightly covered pot, I was bowled over by its taste and texture, not to mention by how much easier it was to manage the heat. After that, there was no looking back.\n\nMost of us rarely set our ovens below 325 degrees, but baking a stew at 300, or even 275, is ideal. The meat softens, but never collapses or becomes stringy. The liquid and aromatics are fused into the kind of rich, complex sauce that professional chefs used to spend decades learning to achieve.\n\nMy favorite recipe has hints of rosemary, thyme, orange peel and juniper berries, uses a whole bottle of wine, and is thickened simply by crushing the long-cooked potatoes and carrots into the sauce at the end. (It has been cobbled together from recipes by several South-of-France-loving food writers, like Richard Olney, Mireille Johnston and Patricia Wells.) Any herbs, vegetables and spices of your liking are equally viable.\n\nIt does take a good three to five hours to cook a big batch of stew this way. I am quite comfortable leaving my house with the oven on low; many people are not. But beef stew is a movable feast: You can cook it at night or over the weekend; or cook it for half the time, then refrigerate (or, in cold weather, leave it in the turned-off oven overnight). The cooking process can be completed the next evening, or beyond, and the finished stew can wait days (in the refrigerator) before being served. (Like gingerbread, dark chocolate brownies and other dishes with powerfully flavored ingredients, red-wine beef stew benefits from a rest before serving.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

All you need to capture it is a heavy pot with a heavy lid, like a Dutch oven or a cocotte. Because of the tight seal between pot and lid, the pressure in the pot seems to help the liquid penetrate the meat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of which brings us to the elephant on the page: using electric pressure cookers to speed up or simplify the stew-making process. Watchers of this space will not be surprised that I have been a holdout on the electric pressure cooker. The last new appliance I adopted was a miniature microwave, in 2002. (I still use it.)\n\nMy kitchen work surface is the size of a two-page spread of The New York Times, and neither a rice cooker nor a slow cooker ever made it through the counter-space test. But when trusted friends and colleagues like Melissa Clark fall hard for a new technology, eventually the FOMO becomes overwhelming.\n\nSo I got one.\n\nIt is true that (unlike the Crock-Pots of yore), these machines can saut\u00e9 just as well as most skillets; possibly better. Instead of having to raise and lower the heat as ingredients are added, a good saut\u00e9 function adjusts it for you.\n\nFor a long-cooked stew, \u201cslow cookers have the low-heat thing down,\u201d said the Georgia-based chef Hugh Acheson, who recently dedicated a book to them, \u201cThe Chef and the Slow Cooker\u201d (Clarkson Potter, 2017). In most, as long as the lid is not locked, you can get the slow evaporation that cooks and reduces the liquid. As long as the ingredients are well browned beforehand (Mr. Acheson says there\u2019s just no way around that step), you can make a good, wine-infused beef stew that is a blank slate for bright, brilliant garnishes.\n\nBut, he acknowledged, only the intense, circulating heat of a traditional oven produces the kind of caramelized, varied texture in the meat that makes a stew truly great.\n\nFor a weeknight, high-pressure cooking does tenderize chuck meat in 45 minutes, instead of four to five hours, as proved by the food writer and researcher J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt in his admirable take on the dish.\n\nAnd yet. To achieve his simulacrum of a slow-cooked, wine-infused stew, Mr. L\u00f3pez-Alt adds a slurry of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, anchovies and powdered gelatin to the cooking liquid. I have nothing against these ingredients, but I did not want to use them as a back channel to the perfect beef stew.\n\nEating it was rather like wearing a perfect knockoff of an expensive handbag: It may look and feel the same, and you may receive just as many compliments. But you know it\u2019s not the same, and that knowledge, if not the stew itself, leaves an odd aftertaste. It\u2019s worth saving up for the real thing.\n\nRecipe: Slow-Cooked Red Wine Beef Stew\n\nAnd to drink ...\n\nConventional wisdom would suggest that you drink the same wine used to marinate the beef. But a modest bottle would be best for the marinade, and this stew offers an opportunity to drink an excellent red. The ideal accompaniment would be dry, intense and structured enough to stand up to the rich beef, but not powerfully fruity or oaky. I think first of a red from the Northern Rh\u00f4ne Valley, like a Cornas or a Hermitage, both with the depth to match the stew. You could try an aged Barolo or Brunello di Montalcino, or perhaps even an older Bandol. A good cabernet sauvignon from the Santa Cruz Mountains would be delicious, as would a restrained Napa cabernet. If you\u2019re not a fan of red wine, good stout might be your best option.

And Jason Vargas, whom the Mets signed to a two-year $16-million deal this winter, will make his season debut on Saturday as he returns from a hand injury.\n\nSo Harvey, who had a 6.00 earned run average through four starts this season, was sent to the bullpen this weekend.

The Mets later won the game in extra innings.\n\nIn all, Harvey walked one and struck out two over two innings. He was aggressive and threw a lot of fastballs (92 to 94 miles per hour) and sliders, two pitches that are no longer what they once were before the injuries. His pitch selection and command still needed sharpening.\n\nHe did not appear in Wednesday\u2019s game, a sloppy affair in which starter Steven Matz gave up seven runs (three earned) over three and one-third innings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Even as they demoted Harvey to the bullpen, they stressed that they still might need him in the rotation later in the season. They had experience with starting pitchers who moved to the bullpen and returned better, such as Trevor Bauer, Carlos Carrasco and Danny Duffy.\n\nTo make this work, Eiland said Harvey needed to channel the expected anger into improvement and to \u201cbuy into\u201d the new duties. After Tuesday\u2019s game, Callaway thought Harvey had done so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic this is going to work, but to think this is going to happen in 24 to 48 hours, I don\u2019t think any of us here believe that,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cWe think it can happen for him pretty quick. He\u2019s not doing this alone. I told him that: We\u2019re behind you. We\u2019re going to do all we can to help you get through this.\u201d\n\nBut after Tuesday\u2019s game, Harvey was not in the mood to discuss his performance in a role he did not like, so Callaway and the rookie catcher Tomas Nido, who had never caught Harvey before, answered questions about it.\n\nIt was not the first (or second) time Harvey had declined to speak with reporters following a less-than-stellar outing during his Mets tenure. Teammates, such as injured captain David Wright, and team officials have spoken to him in the past about the value of accountability. Perhaps because of that, some were either oblivious or indifferent about Harvey\u2019s additional refusal this week.\n\nHarvey\u2019s body has certainly dealt with a lot \u2014 Tommy John and thoracic outlet syndrome surgeries, and shoulder weakness. Injuries force players to adapt. Scheduled to be a free agent this off-season, Harvey is in an uncomfortable position, with a reputation for poor behavior and a pattern of poor results on the field.\n\nAsked before the game if he had discussed with Harvey the refusal to talk to reporters, Callaway said that he had not because the rules did not require it.

Callaway, a former pitching coach, and Eiland were hired for their pitching expertise. Ricco said the team would lean on the two to help Harvey rebuild his pitching and confidence.\n\nHe has already made one comeback, overcoming a Tommy John surgery in late 2013 with a dominant 2015 season.\n\n\u201cWe admire the passion and the pride he has, and that\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s going to get him back to being a productive guy,\u201d Ricco said of Harvey. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised he\u2019s a little frustrated at this. He\u2019s not supposed to be happy about it.\u201d\n\nLater on Saturday, the Mets lost, 4-3, to the Braves on a walk-off ninth-inning bunt single by Ender Inciarte that allowed Johan Camargo to score just ahead of a throw home by first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. The Mets led, 3-0, after a strong start by Jacob deGrom, who struck out 10 and allowed just four hits over seven innings.

Harvey threw a bullpen session on Saturday, the day he was told of his demotion, so Tuesday was the first day he was available to pitch in his new role.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarvey warmed up, then sat to wait for the top of the fifth inning to end.

He softened that demand hours later after a National Security Council meeting, setting a goal of bringing the troops home within a few months.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack, however, enraged the president, and he promised a decision on a response this week.\n\nMr. Macron also said France would continue to push for a cease-fire at the United Nations and for humanitarian aid for Syrian civilians to avoid what he described as \u201cthe terrible images of crimes that we saw, with children and women who were dying by suffocation, because they were subjected to chlorine.\u201d\n\nThe French have warplanes equipped with cruise missiles in Jordan and in the United Arab Emirates, which are within striking range of Syria.", "title": "Mattis Tries to Put Brakes on Possible Syria Strike, to \u2018Keep This From Escalating\u2019", "authors": ["Helene Cooper", "Thomas Gibbons-Neff", "Peter Baker"]}

The recent exits of both General McMaster and Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state have focused more attention on Mr. Mattis\u2019s role in the cabinet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the Syria airstrikes in closed-door meetings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put a check on this president, on any president, when it comes to Congress\u2019s constitutional responsibility to wage war,\u201d Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said in an interview on Tuesday. She called last week\u2019s Syria\u2019s strikes \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nAs he pressed his case last week, before the allied strikes with Britain and France, Mr. Mattis lost the battle over getting congressional authorization. But he won the larger war.\n\nMr. Mattis prevailed in limiting the strikes to three targets that did not risk endangering Russian troops scattered at military installations around Syria. Nor did the 105 missiles hit Syrian military units believed to be responsible for carrying out an April 7 suspected chemical weapons attack on Douma, near Damascus.\n\nIn the end, the narrowly targeted strikes belied Mr. Trump\u2019s description Friday night of a larger coordinated response that could take days or weeks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power \u2014 military, economic and diplomatic,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an address to the nation as the strikes were underway. \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\u201d\n\nBut there have been no additional strikes since then, and the Pentagon said no more are being planned. \u201cThis is a one-time shot,\u201d Mr. Mattis said on Friday, calling the airstrikes \u201ca very strong message to dissuade\u201d President Bashar al-Assad of Syria from using chemical weapons against his own people.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s drumbeat of threats last week of a sharp response to the suspected gas attacks all but guaranteed that the United States military would strike Syria, according to two Defense Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Mattis and other aides quickly talked him out an immediate withdrawal.\n\nPentagon officials said there was also worry that congressional opposition to American military engagements that still rely on authorizations approved after the 2001 terrorist attacks could grow without getting Capitol Hill onboard before striking at Mr. Assad\u2019s chemical weapons program.\n\nMr. Trump did not necessarily want to hit Syria hard enough to bring Russia into the war, administration officials said.

The walk to Washington by the four activists provides one of the more dramatic sections of her narrative. The students believed Obama might sympathize with them because he had a Kenyan father. But they knew comprehensive reform would be a tough sell. At the same time, asking for passage of the Dream Act felt like a betrayal of the family members who had sacrificed so much on their behalf. The Dreamers did not want to choose between saving their parents and saving themselves.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the walkers, Gaby Pacheco, had an idea: Instead of picking between competing solutions, one that would grant a path to citizenship to minors only, the other that would grant it to every undocumented immigrant regardless of age, why not ask for \u201cdeferred action\u201d for all Dreamers \u2014 in other words, a guarantee that law-abiding students would not be targeted for deportation. Then they could continue to support both comprehensive reform and the Dream Act. Gaby and a friend hatched the idea after getting to know Marie Gonzalez, a Missouri student who had been allowed to remain in the United States even after her undocumented status was publicly revealed. Marie\u2019s father had overstayed a visa, and wound up on the evening news because he worked for the state governor. After Marie began blogging about the family\u2019s ordeal, federal officials deferred her deportation because she had not broken laws of her own volition (though they deported her parents). The four students from Miami envisioned making deferred action available to all who shared Marie\u2019s circumstances. And that was what they asked for when they finally made it to Washington: deferred action for childhood arrivals, or DACA, as the program eventually became known.\n\nWides-Mu\u00f1oz covered immigration for The Associated Press, and she capably depicts how the Dreamer movement grew out of two decades\u2019 worth of political activity by students, attorneys, politicians and grass-roots advisers, all of whom helped make DACA a reality. That program, which went into effect in 2012, transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of undocumented students by granting them temporary permission to remain in the country and to work legally, even though it offered them no path to citizenship.\n\nIt is deeply ironic that a book about the achievements of these student activists must conclude with the election of Donald J. Trump, who campaigned on the idea of ending DACA entirely. While Trump has since expressed sympathy for Dreamers, one of his first actions as president was to appoint as his attorney general Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Sessions appears throughout Wides-Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s saga as one of the primary critics of the immigrant rights movement, a figure who blocked any attempt at comprehensive reform and every iteration of the Dream Act.\n\nEven as Trump vacillates, it seems likely that his administration will take a hard stance against immigrants who lack legal status, and the tenuous victory for belonging that the student activists worked so hard to achieve is likely to unravel. The only real solution to structural illegitimacy that will adequately protect these immigrants is comprehensive reform with a path to citizenship. For that to pass Congress, however, these brave kids and their allies will have to take up the fight once more. Wides-Mu\u00f1oz reminds us that thanks to the ability of young people to dream, what seems impossible today may yet prove achievable tomorrow.", "title": "Meet the Dreamers Who Walked 1,500 Miles to Stay in America", "authors": ["Helen Thorpe", "Laura Wides-Mu\u00f1oz"]}

This is just what the Tea Party did in 2010 and 2014.\n\nThere is considerable disagreement over whether deregulated campaign finance and the mobilization of the angriest segment of the Republican electorate will inflict permanent damage on the Republican establishment.\n\nMichael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me by email. \u201cThe establishment, such as it is, still exists, but its influence has been permanently weakened by changes in the media,\u201d not just by conservative media, but by social media that \u201cenables candidates to reach their respective bases in an inexpensive way. Endorsements and money mean less and less.\u201d\n\nIdeological media outlets on both the left and right, Tanner argues \u201ccarry more weight than ever before,\u201d displacing establishment influence over candidate selection, because both sides are now more dependent on mobilizing base voters than in persuading the ever-smaller faction of uncommitted voters.\n\nA colleague of Tanner\u2019s, Emily Ekins, director of polling at Cato, argued in an email that\n\nIt\u2019s useful to not think of the G.O.P. establishment as a cohesive bloc but rather as a coalition that has been fracturing long before Trump arrived. We saw this with the rise of the tea party, the push to oust former Speaker John Boehner, the House Freedom Caucus, the inability of House Republicans to agree on health care reform, etc. Without cohesion it\u2019s hard for it to control the process.\n\nEkins points out that Trump\u2019s successful defiance of the establishment in winning the nomination has not resulted in the abandonment of policies favored by the traditional power brokers.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to policymaking, traditional establishment priorities appear to maintain influence over agenda setting,\u201d she wrote:\n\nAlthough reforming the tax system and repealing the ACA (Obamacare) are traditional Republican priorities, these were ranked far lower, below a border wall, among Trump\u2019s core set of supporters. So while the establishment may be hanging back such that they avoid conflicts with Trump, they are still engaged in the policymaking process.\n\nExpanding on this theme in \u201cIntraparty Democracy and the 2016 Election,\u201d Julia Azari and Seth Masket, political scientists at Marquette and the University of Denver, argue that the breakdown of establishment forces has endangered the workings of the political system. Democratization, in other words, has undermined democracy:\n\nIt is not without irony that the most recent presidential election produced a result that so violated a great many substantive ideas about democracy. From his campaign promises to jail his opponent to his pre-election lamentations that the general electoral contests were rigged to his vows to strip citizens of their rights for expressing unpopular political views, Donald Trump proved to be one of the most hostile presidential candidates toward basic democratic norms in the modern age.\n\nHow \u201cdid such democratic parties produce such an anti-democratic result?\u201d Azari and Masket ask. Their answer:\n\nThe parties\u2019 moves toward internal party democracy, we maintain, helped create an environment in which a candidate like Trump could succeed. We believe that several aspects of party democratization are responsible for the inability of the Republican Party to thwart Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nPut another way, the demotion of Republican power brokers opened the door to the Trump presidency.\n\nIn a separate essay, \u201cWeak parties and strong partisanship are a bad combination,\u201d Azari wrote:\n\nVoters do not have to listen to elite signals. Elites do not have to listen to each other\u2019s signals. Parties have been stripped (in part by their own actions) of their ability to coordinate and bargain.\n\nNot only have party establishments lost their ability to coordinate and bargain, but Trump has successfully pushed the Republican Party elite into a corner. As Masket wrote in an email,\n\nTrump has access to a group of voters that they\u2019ve been courting for decades \u2014 working class whites. They\u2019re eager to claim the support of this demographic and, more importantly, terrified to offend it by turning on Trump.\n\nThe Trump insurgency, in this context, amounted to an internal realignment or revolution within the Republican Party.

Awaiting her is not a British prince, but rather the lawyer Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), the romantic interest of Rachel Zane, a character that Ms. Markle imbued with a mix of charm, conscientiousness and grace over her seven-year run on the show.\n\nThe appearance doubled as the capstone on Ms. Markle\u2019s career. She has said she has given up acting to be a full-time royal, which will become official with her marriage to Prince Harry on May 19.\n\nAt first glance it seems like a scant acting legacy. But, as Rachel, she was a subtly influential force on a pulpy legal drama that quietly had one of the most diverse casts on television. Debuting in the role of the ing\u00e9nue, Ms. Markle actively repositioned Rachel out of the eye-candy slot, and by the end, her character had become the show\u2019s moral conscience.\n\nWith the departure of Rachel and Mike, gone to start a do-gooder firm in Seattle, \u201cSuits\u201d not only loses a fan favorite (Ms. Markle) and one of its leads (Mr. Adams, who is also leaving the show), it also risks sacrificing the nuanced themes of class, race and corporate outsiders that their characters came to represent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKeeping in line with USA\u2019s former \u201cblue skies\u201d motto, \u201cSuits\u201d never billed itself as a political show.

While mental health issues may no doubt play a role, it is important for the public to know that rates of mental illness are essentially similar in countries throughout the globe. However, \u201conly in America\u201d are weapons of mass destruction readily available in stores, online and in gun shows.\n\nMoreover, even if the United States were an outlier for mental illness, the public should keep in mind that our president last year supported the repeal of an Obama-era rule that would have made it more difficult for mentally ill persons who are not capable of managing their own Social Security benefits to purchase weapons.\n\nClearly, what distinguishes us from every other country is not mental illness, but the ability of our people, regardless of their mental or emotional state, to purchase and, in some cases, to openly carry pistols, rifles and semiautomatic rifles.

But the team opted not to let him go a week between starts.\n\nInstead, deGrom was announced as the Mets\u2019 starter for Thursday in Washington, the Nationals\u2019 home opener.\n\nLugo is the Mets\u2019 fifth starter for now, since an other option for the role, Jason Vargas, was hit on his right hand by a line drive near the end of spring training and needed surgery to remove the broken hamate bone. Vargas, a left-hander, threw a bullpen session on Saturday but still had the sutures in his right hand so he was not allowed to catch the ball for himself.\n\nVargas was originally scheduled to throw a simulated game to the outfielder Michael Conforto on Monday at Citi Field. Conforto, the Mets\u2019 lone All-Star last season, had progressed so quickly from September shoulder surgery that he was a possibility to be activated from the 10-day disabled list as soon as he was eligible on Thursday.

The Mets added two more in the sixth without getting a hit, and then Cabrera, hitting .356 with a 1.041 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, belted his fourth home run of the season in the seventh to make it 6-1.\n\nBut once deGrom left the game, having allowed two singles, it all caved in on the Mets. Lugo walked Howie Kendrick to load the bases. Callaway then called upon Blevins, his left-handed specialist, to face the left-handed hitting Harper. That resulted in a two-run single, a lead cut to 6-3, and another call to the bullpen, for Ramos. He began well, striking out Ryan Zimmerman, but allowed a single to Severino, loading the bases once again. Ramos then walked pinch-hitter Matt Reynolds to force in the Nationals fourth run of the game.\n\nThat prompted Callaway to bring in his closer, Familia, who surrendered a single to Wilmer Difo, bringing home two more runs and tying the game. With no one up in the pen, Callaway was forced to stay with Familia, who hit Moises Sierra with a pitch, loading the bases yet again, and then walked Michael Taylor, forcing in the go-ahead run. The inning only ended because a screaming line drive by Trea Turner happened to be hit right at Mets left-fielder Michael Conforto.\n\nThe Nationals added their eighth run on a solo home run by Kendrick off Hansel Robles leading off the ninth.", "title": "Mets\u2019 Bullpen Collapses, Wasting Jacob deGrom\u2019s Strong Night", "authors": []}

It was totally different than what happened the other night. We went out there and the players in the clubhouse took that game.\u201d\n\nThe huge comeback also helped Callaway avoid possible criticism for a risky move he made in the fourth inning, pulling starting pitcher Steven Matz for a pinch-hitter after Matz had retired 10 batters in a row. The Mets were trailing by a run at the time, and Callaway felt the urgency to make the move then. Unfortunately, the move did not result in a run. But when asked to defend the move, Callaway said it was only partially motivated by the desire to drive a run in. He cited the fact that Matz had thrown 33 pitches in the first inning, a workload which Callaway believes almost always catches up to a pitcher.\n\nMatz appeared to stew on the bench after the decision, but later said he understood the reasoning behind it.\n\n\u201cI definitely understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Mickey would understand I wouldn\u2019t be happy.

Washington starter Tanner Roark appeared destined to make that stand up.\n\nRoark limited the Mets to two runs and two hits in seven strong innings, but the Mets attacked the Washington bullpen in the eighth \u2014 especially relief pitcher Ryan Madson, who had been effective in the Nationals\u2019 win the previous night.\n\nMichael Conforto led off the pivotal inning with a single, and Cespedes and Asdrubal Cabrera followed with hits to load the bases before Frazier came to the plate.

By the time Cespedes came to the plate, the Mets already led by three runs, and his homer added to the festive atmosphere already filling the stadium.\n\n\u201cThat inning was unbelievable,\u201d Callaway said.\n\nThe grand slam was the sixth of Cespedes\u2019s career (five of them with the Mets) and the third of the season already for the Mets, who came from behind to win for the eighth time in 17 games. Frazier said their ability to erase deficits comes from their belief that, as long as they are within four runs, one swing of the bat can get them back into the game.\n\nOn Wednesday it took a lot more than one swing, but as Frazier\u2019s knowing look toward Henley suggested, that is what made it so much fun, at least for the Mets.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the excitement we bring,\u201d Frazier said.", "title": "Mets\u2019 Huge Rally Helps Avoid a Nationals Sweep", "authors": ["David Waldstein"]}

The court sided with Article 19, a free-expression group that sued the government over its ad-spending practices, and told lawmakers to pass legislation by the end of this month.\n\nCongress may meet that deadline, but advocates say the measure would do nothing to fix the problem the court identified: Free expression suffers when the government can financially reward or punish news outlets.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It involves possible bank fraud, a person briefed on the matter said.\n\nMr. Trump angrily denounced the raids as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201can attack on our country in a true sense.\u201d Read an annotated transcript of his remarks.", "title": "Michael Cohen, Syria, Mark Zuckerberg: Your Tuesday Briefing", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-10 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Trump values few things more than loyalty, but secrecy is one of them. For years, to keep the circle of people involved as small as possible, he chose to have Mr. Cohen serve as his legal attack dog from a perch inside Trump Tower in Manhattan instead of having outside counsel deal with his problems, according to two people familiar with their relationship.\n\nIn private, Mr. Cohen has compared himself to Tom Hagen, the smooth consigliere to the mafia family in the movie \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d His detractors have used other descriptions, with one longtime Trump associate saying that the words \u201cfinesse\u201d and Mr. Cohen have rarely been yoked together in a sentence.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf nothing else, the federal investigation, which has also drawn in a tabloid company friendly to Mr. Trump, has cast a harsh light on a partnership that, until recently, at least, worked out well for both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen, who met Mr. Trump nearly two decades ago when he bought units in several Trump buildings in New York, later played the role of point man and adviser on some of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to expand his brand internationally.\n\nMr. Cohen also became his boss\u2019s go-to guy for cleaning up messes, from local zoning disputes to negative stories. The lawyer seemed to relish his reputation as Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpit bull\u201d and embraced an aggressive \u2014 some say bullying \u2014 approach to solving problems.\n\nThough Mr. Cohen has been sidelined from the Trump inner circle since the election \u2014 he never got a senior administration job, which people who know him say he expected \u2014 he has remained devoted to the president. On Twitter, he regularly speaks up on his behalf and assails critics. On Sunday, the day before the F.B.I. raid on his office, Mr. Cohen posted a quote about the importance of loyalty, adding: \u201cI will always protect our @POTUS.\u201d\n\nOne such attempt at protection was his effort in July 2015 to quash a Daily Beast article about an old complaint that Mr. Trump\u2019s first wife, Ivana, had made during their divorce, in which she claimed marital rape. She later withdrew the allegation. Mr. Cohen told a reporter for the website that marital rape was not legally possible, and threatened the reporter if the story went forward.\n\nAfter that, he mostly kept out of the public eye, helping the campaign build African-American and religious coalitions and raising money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to protect Mr. Trump from claims by two women of extramarital affairs have emerged as a major distraction \u2014 and possibly worse \u2014 for the White House.\n\nMr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to silence the pornographic actress Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, began as early as 2011, when he threatened legal action against a tabloid website that tried to publish her story. During the 2016 campaign, he says, he decided on his own to draw $130,000 from a home equity line of credit and pay Ms. Clifford to keep quiet, channeling the payment through a limited liability company.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cohen has repeatedly denied any impropriety around the efforts to restrain Ms. Clifford from speaking out. And he has maintained that he was simply trying to deal with a potentially damaging story even though, he said, it was false.\n\nWhat is more, Mr. Cohen has also insisted that he made the payment to Ms. Clifford without consulting Mr. Trump. Asked recently whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump told reporters he did not, and referred questions to Mr. Cohen.\n\nStill, Mr. Cohen\u2019s claim that he struck a nondisclosure agreement with Ms. Clifford by himself, coupled with his effort to force her to comply with it, has exposed Mr. Trump to possibly having to testify about his knowledge of what his lawyer was up to. Ms. Clifford sued Mr. Trump last month, and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has filed court papers seeking to depose the president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The tabloid business bought the rights to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s story alleging an affair with Mr. Trump and never published it. David J. Pecker, now the chairman of A.M.I., was the chief executive of Hachette in the 1990s and for a time published Mr. Trump\u2019s in-house hotel magazine.\n\nMr. Trump, who was from Queens, and the Bronx-born Mr. Pecker viewed themselves as outsiders looking in at an elitist Manhattan establishment. First at Hachette and later, when he took over chairmanship of A.M.I., Mr. Pecker acquired a reputation for buying and burying stories in ways that protected associates like Mr. Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeveral people close to A.M.I. and Mr. Cohen have said that the lawyer was in regular contact with company executives during the presidential campaign, when The Enquirer regularly heralded Mr. Trump and attacked his rivals. The Times reported in February that A.M.I. had shared Ms. McDougal\u2019s allegations with Mr. Cohen, though the company said it did so only as part of efforts to corroborate her story, which it said it could not do. Ms. McDougal\u2019s lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, and Mr. Cohen communicated around the time as she and A.M.I. were finalizing their deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe agreements for Ms. McDougal\u2019s and Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence formed the basis of complaints by the public interest group Common Cause to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. The group claims the payments amounted to improper campaign contributions.\n\nOn Monday, as news of the F.B.I. raids broke, The Times reported that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was looking into a $150,000 donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s charitable foundation from a Ukrainian billionaire that was solicited by Mr. Cohen during the 2016 campaign. In addition, Mr. Mueller has examined Mr. Cohen\u2019s postelection role in forwarding to the administration a Ukraine-Russia peace proposal pushed by a Ukrainian lawmaker.\n\nAnd Trump-Russia investigators have also examined the 2015 Moscow deal that Mr. Cohen pushed at a time when his boss was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s long-held desire to build a Trump property in Russia found new life when Felix Sater, a friend of Mr. Cohen\u2019s and a longtime associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, surfaced with a fresh proposal. He exchanged emails and phone calls with Mr. Cohen in late 2015 saying that he had a prospective developer lined up, and that he could use his contacts in Russia to garner Kremlin support for the project.\n\nMr. Cohen wasted no time, arranging for Mr. Trump to sign a letter of intent for the Moscow tower deal. But the project seemed to stall in the coming months.\n\nRather than let it go, Mr. Cohen reached out directly to Mr. Putin\u2019s press secretary in January 2016, asking for assistance. Later, he asserted that his effort was unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cI decided to abandon the proposal less than two weeks later for business reasons,\u201d he said, \u201cand do not recall any response to my email.\u201d", "title": "Michael Cohen, \u2018Ultimate Trump Loyalist,\u2019 Now in the Sights of the F.B.I.", "authors": ["Mike Mcintire", "Jim Rutenberg", "Maggie Haberman"]}

He planned differently.\n\n\u201cI never really had May 1 in my mind,\u201d Conforto said. \u201cIt was, let\u2019s see how quickly I can get ready, stay healthy at the same time and do things the right way.\u201d\n\nAnd in spring training, Conforto passed every test the Mets gave him.

But Conforto contended that he felt ready to face the talented Nationals, and Strasburg.

And he then confirmed his healthy status with his home run.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s extremely difficult,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cIt shows what kind of talent he is.\u201d\n\nWith Conforto once again atop the Mets\u2019 lineup, the Mets improved to 5-1 this season. But until Thursday, they had been generally winning games without major contributions from their best players, save for Yoenis Cespedes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Or that Jacob deGrom\u2019s first start of the season was unspectacular. Or that outfielder Jay Bruce entered Thursday\u2019s game with no home runs and only four hits in 20 at-bats. Until Thursday, the Mets\u2019 strengths had been the team\u2019s depth and bullpen, which has now logged 13 consecutive scoreless innings.\n\nBut with Conforto back, other key members of the team stepped forward, too. DeGrom produced a gutsy six-inning outing, allowing just two runs, with only one of them earned. And he escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in his final inning without allowing anyone to score.\n\n\u201cI had to find a way to get out of it,\u201d he said.\n\nBruce misplayed a ground ball single to right field in the first inning and then missed hitting a home run by a few feet in the second. But in the top of the seventh, he didn\u2019t come up short at all, smashing a grand slam off reliever Brandon Kintzler that pushed the game out of the Nationals\u2019 reach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCespedes did his part, too. He hit his third home run of the season in the fourth inning on a low pitch from Strasburg, the type Cespedes excels at clobbering.\n\nBut the best development for the Mets on Thursday was provided by Conforto. He is 25, much younger than the over-30 regulars that populate the Mets\u2019 lineup. He began last season under a cloud of doubt following a disappointing 2016 campaign, but by late April, he was thriving as the Mets\u2019 everyday leadoff hitter.\n\nFrom that perch, he hit 27 home runs, drove in 68 runs and posted a .279 batting average and team-high .939 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. He was the Mets\u2019 lone representative in July\u2019s All-Star Game. And then he went down because of one errant swing.\n\nHis return, Callaway said, adds a whole other level of anxiety for the other team.\u201d And it makes the Mets more intriguing.\n\n\u201cHis first two at-bats were his rehab and by his third at-bat he was ready,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cHe\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d", "title": "Michael Conforto Returns, the Baseball Departs, and the Mets Win Again", "authors": ["James Wagner"]}

{"date": "2018-04-28 00:00:00", "text": "That order was almost certainly not the product of intelligence analysis about the threat posed by immigrants from certain nations, but rather the president trying to fulfill a campaign promise based on exaggerated fears about immigrants and unfair criticism of the refugee vetting system. One former senior intelligence official told me that when the ban was announced internally, everyone was simply told to get on board.\n\nI joined several other former directors and acting directors of the C.I.A., two former deputy directors, a former director of national intelligence and a former head of the National Counterterrorism Center and others in filing an amicus brief opposing the ban. The people now occupying our old positions were notably silent on the merits of the order.\n\nOver time it has become clear to me that security decisions in the Trump administration follow a certain pattern.

According to The Washington Post, one Trump confidant called him \u201cthe two-minute man\u201d with \u201cpatience for a half page.\u201d He insists on five-page or shorter intelligence briefs, rather than the 60 pages we typically gave previous presidents. There is something inherently disturbing in that. There are some problems that cannot be simplified.\n\nSometimes, almost magically, he gets it right. The president\u2019s speech last August on Afghanistan was worth listening to, clearly the product of the traditional deliberative process where intelligence sets the picture based on the best available information, and then security agencies weigh in with views that are adjudicated by the National Security Council.\n\nBut the Afghan experience has been the exception. The president continues to attack the Iranian nuclear deal and is likely to end it even in the face of intelligence that Iran has not committed a material breach of the compact, that the deal makes it more difficult for Iran to build a weapon and that it gives us visibility into its nuclear program.\n\nThen there is Russia. The president only recently and grudgingly agreed to impose sanctions on Russians believed to have interfered in the American election, and he continues to characterize the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d while relentlessly attacking agencies of his own administration.\n\nHe humiliated the attorney general, undercut his national security adviser and engaged in personal vendettas against senior F.B.I. officials.", "title": "Opinion | Michael Hayden: The End of Intelligence", "authors": []}

Absolutely. (She called Ivanka Trump, for instance, \u201cabout as helpful to women as an empty box of tampons.\u201d)\n\nBut was it gratuitous? Not at all. It drove mercilessly toward its themes: that this administration lies; that its female members are covering for a sexist president; and that journalists have enabled it all with breathless coverage.\n\nThose are points of view, and not ones that anyone needs to agree with. But comedy\u2019s job is to have a point of view, to pick a hill to die on and defend it with furiously thrown pies. Comedy is not a Page A1 news analysis. It is not its job to call the other side for comment or throw in a \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraph for balance.\n\nMs. Wolf\u2019s most controversial jokes were about the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, partly because she made them to her face. Ms. Sanders was on the dais in place of Mr. Trump, who counterprogrammed the dinner with a campaign rally in Michigan.\n\nThe jokes were personal, yes, because character is personal.\n\nComparing Ms. Sanders to Aunt Lydia, the rigid enforcer for a misogynist state on \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d jabs at Ms. Sanders\u2019s role, not her looks.

That job once involved defending Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet that claimed the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Mika Brzezinski came to see him \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift.\u201d The president, Ms. Sanders said, \u201cfights fire with fire.\u201d (Ms. Brzezinski nonetheless tweeted in Ms. Sanders\u2019s support.)\n\nIf only Ms. Wolf had a Sarah Huckabee Sanders of her own. Instead she has the W.H.C.A., a group whose essential work is undermined by its highest-profile event, which is perennially trapped between provocation and caution, between the thirst to be edgy and the need to be liked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dinner \u2014 carried, probably unwisely, on live TV \u2014 is a multicourse tasting menu of mixed messages. It argues passionately for reporting without fear or favor, but shows reporters hobnobbing with their subjects like \u201cGreat Gatsby\u201d extras. (The Times has not attended in a decade.)\n\nIt takes some doing to emerge from one event painted as simultaneously partisan and toothless, elitist and crude, adversarial and complicit. But the dinner somehow pulls it off.\n\nMeanwhile, the monologues have become bigger than the night around them, creating a tension between the room and the home audience. In 2006, Stephen Colbert gave a brutal one in front of George W. Bush that guests also panned as harsh and disrespectful. It\u2019s now part of his standard bio-hagiography.\n\nFor the journalists, the upside is less clear. The association isn\u2019t obligated to hire a comedian at all. I\u2019m sure the greater D.C. area does not lack for magicians and fire dancers. Send the cameras away. Have a nice dinner in peace.\n\nBut to hire a comic, then renounce her for doing what she does, is weak. Any reporter knows that if you don\u2019t do your homework, the consequences are on you. And to cave under pressure undermines reporters\u2019 work by suggesting, rightly or not, that the Washington press corps can be cowed by the play-for-keeps tactics of this administration.\n\nAs for political balance, it should be noted that the W.H.C.A. invited America\u2019s premiere conservative insult comic, and he chose to do a rally in Michigan instead. Mr. Trump knows the political value of a Don Rickles zinger. He intuits that audiences grant comedians a leeway they don\u2019t to the stuffier professions.\n\nComedians are powerful \u2014 and sometimes more trusted and respected than journalists, as \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and company have shown \u2014 because they can say uncomfortable things flat-out, ditch the euphemisms, call a \u201cfalsehood\u201d a lie. Comedy isn\u2019t reporting, but it is testimony. (Ms. Wolf ended her own routine with a straight line: \u201cFlint still doesn\u2019t have clean water.\u201d)\n\nThe irony of the association\u2019s disavowing Ms. Wolf is that her routine, whether you agree with it or not, was ultimately about defending the mission of the White House press: sticking up for the truth.

So you shouldn\u2019t be shocked if you book a comedian and she points out that the emperor has no clothes. Or when she points below the emperor\u2019s waistline and makes a rude joke.\n\nContrary to what several prominent journalists said, the transcript shows that Michelle Wolf did not make a single joke at the expense of Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s physical appearance. Rather, she did something much worse in the eyes of those assembled: She ridiculed the White House press secretary\u2019s mendacity, hypocrisy and complicity. And in a searing, brutally funny segment, she criticized the willingness of the press to play along:\n\n\u201cYou guys are obsessed with Trump. Did you use to date him? Because you pretend like you hate him, but I think you love him. I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He couldn\u2019t sell steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric, but he has helped you. He\u2019s helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster, and now you\u2019re profiting off of him. And if you\u2019re gonna profit off of Trump, you should at least give him some money because he doesn\u2019t have any.\u201d\n\nNo wonder the crowd seemed so uncomfortable.\n\nSome people noted that Ms. Wolf\u2019s routine was poorly received in the Hilton ballroom itself. But watching her at home I recognized exactly what she was doing. Every performer who has done comedy on television knows that the people in the studio don\u2019t really matter. They\u2019re uncomfortable, they\u2019re tense, and they have to be polite because they\u2019re sitting six inches away from Chris Christie. You\u2019re never getting a real laugh out of them. Instead, you focus on the audience that counts: the folks at home. And the folks at home don\u2019t want comedy that\u2019s polite and tasteful, and secures them access to an interview next Wednesday \u2014 they want comedy that stands on the rooftop and calls out hypocrisy and deceit at the top of its lungs.\n\nThe way the press corps treats the brilliant comedians it hires is an old joke by now, and we all know the punch lines. In 2016, when Larry Wilmore tore into the cable news industry\u2019s history of racist coverage and greeted President Obama in a manner some took offense to, he was deemed to have gone \u201ctoo far.\u201d In 2006, Stephen Colbert mercilessly mocked President George W.

Loyola\u2019s help defense effectively prevented Michigan from getting the ball to him inside, so the Wolverines\u2019 offense consisted largely of shooting 3-pointers (they attempted 13), missing them (they made just two) and letting Wagner get the offensive rebound for the putback.\n\nThis was, in its way, part of the plan, Michigan Coach John Beilein revealed after the game. \u201cBecause they\u2019re switching, we said, \u2018Moe, you\u2019ve just got to roll more, slip more, and get down there and clean up any rebounds you can get, because they\u2019ve got a 6-foot guy on you,\u2019\u201d Beilein said.\n\nWagner finished the game with monster statistics: 24 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nMichigan slowly clawed its way back in the second half, tying the game, 47-47, with under seven minutes left. Then came the blitz, including a run during which Loyola committed turnovers on six consecutive possessions.\n\nWhen Wagner hit a 3-pointer (he had three of them) with 2 minutes, 59 seconds left, it put Michigan up by 8, and a clearly exhausted Loyola seemed done for.\n\nPhoto\n\nMichigan\u2019s defense has been its calling card this year thanks to a new assistant coach, Luke Yaklich, who was in the high school ranks as recently as 2013.

As they walked, they chanted and waved Honduran flags.\n\nTo qualify for asylum, applicants must prove they have been persecuted or fear persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a particular group.\n\nPeople who request protection at a United States entry point must be referred to an asylum officer for a screening, known as a credible-fear interview. If the officer finds that an applicant has a chance of proving fear of persecution, the person must then present his or her case before a judge. More than three quarters of applicants pass that initial review.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only sending people who we think will pass the credible-fear interview,\u201d said Nicole Ramos, a volunteer immigration lawyer helping the caravan.\n\nBut Customs and Border Protection, whose officers are stationed at ports of entry, announced late Sunday that it had exhausted its capacity to handle people traveling without documents.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, caravan organizers escorted some 50 participants along the long, elevated pedestrian walkway at El Chaparral that leads from Tijuana to the entrance to the United States in San Diego. At the gate leading into the American immigration checkpoint, American border authorities reaffirmed that they would not be able to process any more asylum-seekers on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlex Mensing, project coordinator for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a transnational group that organized the caravan, told reporters gathered at El Chaparral that the migrants would remain at the gate, overnight if necessary, until border officials once again had the capacity to process them.\n\n\u201cWe wish that the United States government were capable of accepting more than a few hundred asylum seekers at any given time, since we can certainly pick up more than a 1,000 people in an ICE raid on any given day,\u201d he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the asylum seekers, their relatives and supporters laid out blankets on a plaza outside the entrance to El Chaparral and prepared for a long, chilly night.\n\nWhen they get a chance to make their case, migrant families that request asylum at the port of entry are likely to be placed on buses to Texas, where they will remain in detention centers for mothers and children. Adult men are likely to be detained in any number of facilities across the country that hold undocumented immigrants.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

These include Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party; a variety of Shiite militias in Iraq; and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThis network allows Iran to project military strength abroad while deterring potential attacks on its homeland from Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran\u2019s enemies argue that these activities increase instability in the region by undermining state structures and empowering militias that operate above the law.\n\nIn recent years, Iran\u2019s greatest investments have been in Syria, where it has sent military officers to help preserve the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Israel accuses Iran of using the cover of the war to build a military infrastructure there that could be used in a confrontation with Israel.\n\nThroughout the war, Israel has frequently struck convoys believed to be carrying weapons to Iran\u2019s regional allies.

But no deaths or significant destruction was reported that those sites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn official from the regional alliance that includes Iran, Syria and Hezbollah confirmed that the strikes near Hama had hit a storage site on the base and said they had destroyed 200 missiles and killed 16 people, including 11 Iranians. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.\n\nNeither Israel nor Iran appeared interested in publicizing the strike, which analysts said was probably an effort to diminish the chances that Iran would feel the need to retaliate immediately.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military does not comment on individual attacks in Syria, and a spokesman declined to comment on Sunday\u2019s attack, most likely because if Israel claimed responsibility it could put pressure on Iranian leaders to strike back. Israel\u2019s security cabinet convened an emergency meeting on Monday, apparently to discuss the rising tensions with Israel\u2019s northern neighbors.\n\nA semiofficial Iranian news agency, ISNA, initially said that 18 of 40 people killed in the attacks were Iranian, but the report was later taken down and Iranian officials denied that any of their people had been killed.\n\nThat, too, could have been so that Iranian leaders would not feel compelled to respond immediately, said Amos Yadlin, the former director of intelligence for the Israeli military and now executive director of the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cIf there are no Iranian casualties, you are not committed to retaliation,\u201d Mr. Yadlin said in a conference call with reporters on Monday.\n\nBut he said he expected that Iran would eventually respond to the April attacks, although it was not clear when, where or how.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian retaliation is on its way,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Vaez, the analyst, said that his recent conversations with Iranian officials also suggested that Iran would eventually retaliate for Israel\u2019s strikes on Iranian assets in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey believe that this is a slippery slope, that there is a need to send a message to Israel that there is a cost associated with its pushing the envelope too far,\u201d he said.\n\nBut influencing their decision on when to respond was their concern that any action taken now could push Mr. Trump toward withdrawing from the nuclear agreement, Mr. Vaez said, adding that Israel\u2019s decision to strike on Sunday might have been intended to provoke an Iranian response for that very purpose.\n\n\u201cWe are in a vicious cycle, and the reality is that the collapse of the nuclear deal will significantly increase all these tensions,\u201d Mr. Vaez said. \u201cAll the parties will take the gloves off at that stage.\u201d", "title": "Missile Attack in Syria Reportedly Kills at Least 16, Raising Regional Tensions", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard"]}

He then tore off her shirt, pulled down her pants and took a picture of her with his cellphone, she said.\n\nOfficially, Mr. Greitens is charged only with invasion of privacy, but elected officials calling for Mr. Greitens\u2019s resignation have offered concerns that seem to reach further. Some legislators have questioned whether the woman gave consent to Mr. Greitens during their initial sexual encounter. At one point, the woman said, she broke down in tears; Mr. Greitens responded by consoling her, she said, and then, as she continued crying, he undid his pants and moved his penis near her face. Asked whether she consented to performing oral sex that morning, the woman testified, \u201cIt\u2019s a hard question because I did \u2014 it felt like consent, but, no, I didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d She went on: \u201cCoerced, maybe. I felt as though that would allow me to leave.\u201d\n\nOther lawmakers have said the scandal is a distraction from his work as governor, his political future has crumbled and the process is causing anguish for his wife and children.\n\n\u201cI am very worried as a family man about the effects that this has on his family,\u201d Mike Kehoe, the Senate majority leader and a Republican, said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s political career might have two-and-a-half years on it at best, but he\u2019s going to have a family for life.\u201d\n\nWhat does he say happened?\n\nMr. Greitens acknowledged having a consensual extramarital affair, issuing a statement \u2014 together with his wife, Sheena \u2014 shortly after delivering his State of the State address in January. He has portrayed the issue as a personal matter, not a legal violation, and his lawyers have pushed back vehemently against suggestions of criminal behavior or coercion of any kind. Mr. Greitens has dismissed the legislative committee\u2019s report, which quoted extensively from the woman he had a relationship with, as \u201ctabloid trash.\u201d He called the investigation into his behavior a \u201cpolitical witch hunt.\u201d He declined to answer questions before the same legislative committee she spoke to; his lawyers said he would be willing to answer their questions after the invasion of privacy charge against him was resolved in court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After the release of the 24-page report this week from thelegislative committee, dozens of legislators and other elected officials \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 reiterated calls for Mr. Greitens to step down. They include Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri and a Republican; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat; Mr. Kehoe, the Senate majority leader; and even financial backers like David Humphreys, a businessman whose family was one of Mr. Greitens\u2019s top donors, giving him more than $2 million during his run for governor.\n\nDoes anyone still support Mr. Greitens?\n\nAn inner circle of advisers to the governor, including several strategists and donors, were said to be urging Mr. Greitens to resist calls to resign. Some evangelical leaders, who supported him in 2016 along with an overwhelming number of the state\u2019s white evangelical voters, said they had maintained their support for the governor.\n\nBrandon Park, the lead pastor at Connection Point, an evangelical church in Raytown, Mo., affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, said he did not think Mr. Greitens should resign. He supports the governor\u2019s anti-abortion positions, and he says evangelical Christians respect him for his policies. \u201cI see a lot of these personal attacks both on Trump and Greitens as a way to take away attention from the ideals that matter most to evangelical Christians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does seem to be a little bit of a witch hunt.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, were more critical. Phil Hopper, the pastor of Abundant Live Church near Kansas City, Mo., said he would be \u201camazed\u201d that anybody would be supporting Mr. Greitens, but said that due process must take its course.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nOn May 14, Mr. Greitens will go on trial in St. Louis on the invasion of privacy charge. He sought a bench trial but a judge denied that, so a jury will decide his fate. If convicted, Mr. Greitens could face up to four years in prison.\n\nThen there is the threat of impeachment in a State Capitol where both chambers are dominated by Republicans. The legislative committee that investigated Mr. Greitens\u2019s case \u2014 made up of five Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 will decide whether to file articles of impeachment against him. That decision could happen at any time. In Missouri, leaders are subject to impeachment for a broad array of failings: \u201ccrime, misconduct, habitual drunkenness, willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude or oppression in office.\u201d\n\nIf articles of impeachment were to be filed, the full House would then vote on whether to impeach the governor; if a majority votes in favor of impeachment, the case would then go to the Senate, where seven judges would conduct a trial.\n\nFive of the seven judges must vote in favor of impeachment for the governor to be removed from office \u2014 an action that has never before been taken in Missouri.\n\nWhat does Mr. Greitens\u2019s political future hold?\n\nWhatever the outcome of the criminal trial and the legislative proceedings, political strategists and elected officials said there appeared few paths ahead in politics for Mr. Greitens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDo you go somewhere after this?\u201d John Hancock, a political strategist and former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

In January, he admitted that he had a sexual relationship with his former hairdresser while he was married. The woman has told a legislative committee that Mr. Greitens took a nude or seminude picture of her without her consent, then threatened to make the image public if she told anyone about their affair.\n\nThe new felony charge dates back to actions prosecutors say took place in April 2015, when Mr. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was running for governor and serving on the board of directors for The Mission Continues, a veterans charity that he founded.

He was assessing Salah\u2019s influence on Liverpool, not long after the Egyptian had scored twice in a Premier League game against Leicester City. Something about his low center of gravity, Wright said, the way he controls the ball, the way he seems to cast it under his spell, reminded him of Lionel Messi.\n\nWright was, of course, immediately pilloried. Drawing a comparison between Messi \u2014 or Cristiano Ronaldo, for that matter \u2014 and any player is rightly taboo; such is the status of those two, that they do not measure themselves against their peers, but against only the greats of the past.\n\nWith a quiet insistence, though, more and more professional observers have followed Wright\u2019s lead in recent weeks. Not to say that Salah is the equal of Messi \u2014 far from it \u2014 or that he has achieved, or might yet achieve, as much. It\u2019s just that, in a certain light, at certain points, it is possible to glimpse in Salah a little of Messi\u2019s afterglow.\n\nEven as the idea has gained credence, it still seems fanciful. And yet, every three days or so, Salah does something to give the idea weight. Ordinarily, it is a goal, one of those mesmerizing dribbles that have long since been Messi\u2019s hallmark. Against Roma, though, it was something else, something more significant. Great players win games \u2014 not single-handedly, but through sheer force fo personality. They bend and they shape contests to their will. Nobody does it better than Messi and Ronaldo. Against his old friends from Rome, though, Salah came close.\n\nIt was not just that he scored twice, setting Liverpool on the way to a five-goal lead that, not too long after he left the field, was reduced to a three-goal advantage. Nor is it just that he scored twice so beautifully, with the sort of aristry we associate with Messi: one precision strike from the edge of the penalty area, fizzing past Alisson, Roma\u2019s goalkeeper; one delicate chip \u2014 a dink, really, there is no other word for it \u2014 after exchanging quick-fire passes with Roberto Firmino.", "title": "Mohamad Salah Stands Tall, but Liverpool Cracks Door for Roma", "authors": []}

Greenlee, the author of \u201cThe Political Consequences of Motherhood\u201d and a political scientist at Brandeis. \u201cWhen someone says \u2018I\u2019m running for office because I\u2019m a mom,\u2019 it re-entrenches that women ought to be moms.\u201d\n\nBut she, like others, sees shifts in the political landscape. Some of the new female candidates are younger and have not spent years working their way up from local to state to national political posts. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, said her mother, Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, had to bank her political ambitions for years.\n\n\u201cMy mom would be thrilled to see that women aren\u2019t waiting their turn \u2014 they\u2019re just jumping in,\u201d she said. \u201cBack in the day, a woman had to have an entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of accomplishments, three times as long as a man running. A lot of things that women already do \u2014 running the PTA, raising children, balancing a job and a family \u2014 those are all attributes that make them highly qualified to be in elective office.\u201d\n\nMotherhood can be a credential, but research also suggests that women have to work harder to persuade voters that they have expertise in realms like national security. A study conducted by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation during the 2016 election found voters had the deepest misgivings about mothers with young children, but not about men with young families.\n\nThis newest wave of candidates seems undeterred by this thinking \u2014 and perhaps is poised to toss it out entirely. \u201cWomen are going with their gut,\u201d said Barbara Lee, the foundation\u2019s president. \u201cThey\u2019re running as if these obstacles haven\u2019t taken place in the past. It\u2019s their sense of urgency about changing the status quo.\u201d\n\nThe status quo, of course, is quite stubbornly in place. This raw portrait of the realities of motherhood as a political calling card doesn\u2019t go over with everyone.\n\nMs. Roys, the breast-feeding mother running for governor in Wisconsin, said she is still sometimes asked who would take care of her young children if she were to win.

He said \u201cif these handful of Liberty pilots had issues that they deemed detrimental to the safety of the operation, they should have ceased operations and addressed the issue with Liberty management.\u201d\n\nThe three pilots said FlyNYON brushed aside many of the concerns they did raise, though the company did make some changes based on their complaints.\n\nAfter pilots expressed concern about the tape, they were told in December that FlyNYON had \u201cput an order in for thick rubber bands which will hold the front buckle in place,\u201d according to the minutes of a pilots\u2019 meeting. \u201cThis will eliminate the need for the \u2018blue tape\u2019 on the harnesses.\u201d\n\nAccording to emails and interviews, pilots preferred a different model of harness that could be adjusted to fit passengers of varying sizes without the use of zip ties. The harnesses, which were blue, were considered safer partly because they connected to the tethers in a place that passengers could more easily reach to try to detach themselves. And the blue harnesses were approved by the F.A.A. for some uses, though not specifically open-door helicopters flights, which had not been explicitly addressed in F.A.A. rules.\n\nFlyNYON intended to eventually replace all the yellow harnesses with blue ones, according to emails in November. And a company official told pilots in a January email that the \u201cblue harnesses should take priority over yellow harnesses.\u201d\n\nYet, when pilots insisted on blue harnesses for some smaller passengers, in one instance delaying a flight by requesting a switch, Mr. Day responded testily. In a January email, he wrote that \u201cthe yellow harnesses are stunt/construction harnesses that are designed for human safety hanging off buildings at 1,000 feet-plus. The blue harnesses are F.A.A. approved but that isn\u2019t a requirement for a doors-off flight. The yellow harnesses are just as legal/safe as the blue.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the crash, the company had only a few blue harnesses in use.\n\nCutting the Harness\n\nLikewise, the company\u2019s pilots raised concerns about the tethers used to secure the passengers, via their harnesses, to the interior of the helicopters. It was difficult for passengers to reach the point at which the tethers fastened to their yellow harnesses, and, even if they could reach the connection, it would be difficult for them to disconnect the carabineers that connected the tethers to the harnesses on their own, according to the pilots who worked with FlyNYON. So each passenger was provided a hook-shaped blade, marketed as a seatbelt cutter, that they were instructed to use to sever the tether in case of an emergency that required them to extricate themselves.", "title": "Months Before Deadly Crash, Helicopter Pilots Warned of Safety Issues", "authors": []}

Although it has generally had at least one Afro-Cuban in a high-ranking position, cynics dismissed them as symbolic figures.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough skeptics doubt that too much will change to address the disparities faced by many black people in Cuba, even some of the government\u2019s harshest critics acknowledged that the diversity shift was an important development.\n\n\u201cYes, it has great significance,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Colas, a black anti-Castro activist who sought political asylum in 2001 and now lives in Mississippi. \u201cThe Cuban revolution has historically been white, and seen from the outside as a revolution by white men, where black people were part of the crowd, spectators who were silent or applauded, but never participated.\u201d\n\nMr. Colas said the election, a process in which Mr. Castro and the Communist Party had full control, showed that the former Cuban leader has \u201cbig ears\u201d and was willing to listen to the outcry from black civic and arts organizations. But he noted it would be even more noteworthy if the three black people on the council used their positions to push for racial equality.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if they used those positions to say, \u2018As a black Cuban, I am against injustice against black people in Cuba?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI doubt that they can do that. They are not allowed. Fidel declared that racism is a problem that ended.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s move to shift high-ranking positions to black leaders was an acknowledgment that racism and discrimination had not, in fact, been solved by the revolution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Castro said the struggle to move beyond percentages continued.\n\n\u201cWe still have the battle of proportions, not just in numerical aspects, but qualitative \u2014 in decision-making slots,\u201d he said. \u201cThree women were elected vice president of the Council of State, two of them black \u2014 not only for being black, but for their virtues and qualities.\u201d\n\nWhile inequality persists in the country, the Castro revolution did make important strides for black people.\n\nBefore the revolution, social stratification was profound, with black Cubans open to far less opportunity and enduring far more discrimination than their lighter-skinned fellow citizens. When Fidel Castro came to power after the revolution, one of his early edicts essentially sought an end to racism.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe result was that systemic racism as it exists in the Americas is far less present in Cuba, and social and educational opportunities generally more present for black Cubans \u2014 even those living far from the capital. For many of the revolution\u2019s proponents, it was one of the major achievements at a time when some parts of the United States were still requiring black people to drink from separate water fountains.\n\nAlejandro de la Fuente, a Harvard University Cuba studies professor who has written extensively on Afro-Cubans, said inequality diminished in several ways. His research showed, for example, that in the 1980s, the life expectancy gap between black and white people was better in Cuba than in Brazil or the United States.\n\nAlso, the proportion of black Cubans with college degrees was close to the proportion of white Cubans, he found, whereas in the United States, the proportion of white college degree holders was twice as large as among African-Americans.\n\nBut the improvements, brought on by socialized education, were offset by the economic nose-dive Afro-Cubans faced after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s. More Cubans started living on cash remittances sent from the United States. And almost all the Cubans sending money from the United States were white.\n\nMr. de la Fuente noted that both of the black women named to the council, In\u00e9s Mar\u00eda Chapman Waugh and Beatriz Jhonson Urrutia, are engineers from eastern Cuba, which makes them an example of the kind of educational mobility possible for black women in the country.

Most estimates have the number of black people in Cuba much higher.\n\n\u201cIf you go by the one-drop rule, like you have in the United States, Cuba is like 90 percent black,\u201d Mr. Colas said with a laugh.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Before he helped to shape jazz\u2019s avant-garde tradition, the pianist studied at the New England Conservatory. How much European classical modernism was in his aesthetic? Stray pointillistic gestures, born from a brilliance of touch, might suggest a connection to some early-20th-century mavericks. But the bluesy connotations of his feverish harmonic auroras remained unique.\n\nTaylor loved to cite Duke Ellington. And in a spirited rush of poetic text that accompanied \u201cUnit Structures,\u201d his watershed 1966 album for the Blue Note label, he signaled a key break with mainstream classical tradition, courtesy of lines like: \u201cWestern notation blocks total absorption in the \u2018action\u2019 playing.\u201d\n\nYet by the time reports of his death began to circulate on Thursday evening, and as former collaborators started dedicating performances to his memory, it had long been apparent that Taylor\u2019s dynamism had helped to shape the contemporary classical sphere.

But theaters in cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco routinely charge $16.50 for a standard ticket.\n\nMoviePass believes it can make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters; charging studios fees to promote new films to members; and perhaps even growing big enough (20 million subscribers is a goal) to demand a slice of concession revenue, although Mr. Lowe appears, for now at least, to have backed away from that particular aspiration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a mistake for people to think that we\u2019re after their concessions,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lowe and Mr. Farnsworth said they already had some deals in place with studios, although they would not say which ones. \u201cWe\u2019re collecting significant revenue from partnerships,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cBut they say: \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone that we\u2019re paying you.

How could he have expected to get away with it?\n\nPerhaps he saw what happened when one of the world\u2019s largest banks, HSBC, helped launder billions of dollars in drug proceeds for the Sinaloa cartel, for a financier for Al Qaeda and for others over nearly a decade. When they were caught, they only had to forfeit less than five weeks of profit. No bank employee was criminally charged.\n\nNow consider the potential big fish in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Three years ago, about three months before Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president, the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network fined the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City $10 million for \u201cwillful and repeated violations of the Bank Secrecy Act\u201d for failing to report suspicious transactions and failing to properly file currency transaction reports and keep proper records. The officials noted that the casino had \u201ca long history of prior, repeated B.S.A. violations cited by examiners dating back to 2003.\u201d The casino had been fined $477,700 in 1998. In other words, Mr. Trump\u2019s casino helped launder money and no one was charged with a crime.\n\nOne-fifth of the condos owned by Mr. Trump in the United States were sold to shell companies like those Mr. Manafort used, BuzzFeed News found. Since Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, 70 percent of domestic real estate sales by his companies were to shell companies, USA Today has reported.\n\nA Times investigation found that this sort of behavior is business as usual for many big developers, as shell companies with untraceable funds \u2014 not all with nefarious purposes \u2014 buy a disproportionate number of high-end condos in cities like New York. Nor is this simply a problem for global urban centers. A shell company obscured the purchase of a lobbyist\u2019s luxurious home by the beleaguered administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, when he was an Oklahoma state senator in 2003.\n\nThe recent attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal attorney\u201d Michael Cohen illuminated another not uncommon practice of the business world. One of Mr. Cohen\u2019s specialties was keeping people quiet.

You told this man you didn\u2019t want to have sex, and he didn\u2019t listen. No apology will undo his actions. He behaved not like a friend, but a predator. And he even did so, most disturbingly, knowing your history as a victim of sexual and physical abuse. What\u2019s important here is that you confronted him, which took tremendous courage. It would have been a lot easier to chalk this assault up to the booze, to mixed signals, to that great fraudulent catchall: a misunderstanding. But this was a violation, and one you shouldn\u2019t try to process alone. As a first step, I\u2019d advise calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visiting the website for the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization, at www.rainn.org.\n\nThis man was right about one thing: You should banish the toxic people from your life. The \u201cbest friend\u201d who just date raped you tops that list.\n\nCheryl Strayed: I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, Taken. You were raped by a man you considered to be your best friend. It\u2019s no wonder that you\u2019re devastated. I echo Steve\u2019s advice that you call the National Sexual Assault Hotline. They will help you begin to heal the harm this assault caused you and they will also remind you that in this experience, you\u2019re sadly not alone. Approximately seven out of 10 victims of sexual violence know their perpetrators, according to studies by the Department of Justice , and in many cases \u2014 like yours \u2014 the perpetrators were not only known by the victim but loved. The fact of the prior relationship adds another layer of complexity because very often the victim of such a crime feels as you do \u2014 injured by both the assault and the betrayal of trust that it signifies.\n\nSA: Our culture is only now beginning to reckon with the stark fact that Cheryl notes: Most perpetrators of sexual assault are not strangers, but people we know and often cherish. This may be why there\u2019s so much missing in your description of the events, as you move from \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to and he didn\u2019t listen\u201d to \u201cAfterward I cried.\u201d A lot happened in between those two sentences. Painful as these moments will be to revisit, doing so is vital to your healing. To what extent did this man willfully disregard your stated desires? To what extent did he choose to overlook obvious nonverbal cues? To what extent did you silence yourself and go along with his agenda, and why? Working to sort all of this out \u2014 with help from the folks at RAINN, trusted friends, a therapist \u2014 will help you find clarity about the precise nature of this man\u2019s actions, and your own. I certainly understand your desire to minimize what happened, because the truth is so upsetting. This is why victims so often convince themselves that they are to blame for the crimes committed against them. But by your own description, your friend sexually assaulted you. No apology undoes that violation. It\u2019s O.K. to acknowledge the parts of him that you loved and trusted, and to mourn the loss of his friendship.

What are your models for intimate relationships and how have they shaped your perceptions about what it means to have a romantic partnership? Answering these and other questions in a deep and meaningful way is far more important than figuring out how you might force yourself to refrain from looking at your girlfriend\u2019s old Instagram photos. In fact, doing so is likely the only way you\u2019ll ever stop.\n\nSteve Almond: Love is a powerful narcotic. It warps the mind a little, to quote the novelist John DuFresne. That\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling: love and all that love stirs up within us. Step back and consider your circumstances: You\u2019re four months into what is probably the most intense non-familial relationship of your life. You adore this woman and never want to lose her. It\u2019s perfectly natural that you\u2019re jealous of her ex-lovers. They are reminders that she\u2019s ridden this roller coaster of love with other people in the past, and that she might again.\n\nYou might also be jealous of your lover herself, because she has experience in this dangerous realm, and therefore a bit more perspective. It\u2019s vital that you acknowledge these feelings of vulnerability without being ruled by them. So please stop beating yourself up. Instead, do as Cheryl suggests: seek to understand why you feel plagued by jealousy. Stigmatizing and suppressing your emotions won\u2019t make them go away. It will only make them more powerful.\n\nCS: I urge you to work with a therapist to explore your fears \u2014 and fear is essentially what your jealousy is rooted in, Jealous. Fear that you\u2019re not good enough. Fear that deep down your partner would rather be with someone else. Fear that your heart may someday be broken. Fear, ultimately, of intimacy. I understand why you\u2019re afraid right now. Falling in love means risking vulnerability. My hunch is that your fears about intimacy aren\u2019t particular to this relationship. They\u2019re particular to you.\n\nThe hours you spend thinking about the people your partner used to date is a way of keeping your love for each other at arm\u2019s length. Perhaps beneath your worry that your girlfriend was happier with her exes than she is with you, there\u2019s an unconscious wish. One that will keep you safe \u2014 or at least believing you are. Maybe that\u2019s also the reason you\u2019ve only recently begun having \u201cnormal\u201d romantic experiences. A good therapist will help you explore that.\n\nSA: It\u2019s worth noting that your girlfriend is bisexual, and that both of her previous lovers were men. It may be that some of your fixation here is activated by the fear that your lover\u2019s own sexual desires are more fluid than yours, in terms of gender. If she ultimately decides she wants to be with a man, the logic goes, I\u2019ll be left out in the cold.\n\nBut cutting beneath your specific doubts is the universal truth Cheryl identified: that you may be undermining this love to keep yourself safe from heartbreak. We all do this, to some degree, in relationships that place us at risk \u2014 we unconsciously engineer bad outcomes. It\u2019s how we seize control of dynamics that often feel out of control. But there\u2019s a better way. Working with a therapist will allow you to understand the meaning of your jealousy, which will diminish its power. Remember the big picture here: You deserve love and happiness. It may take some work to fully accept this, Jealous. But you\u2019re on the right path. Nobody writes a letter as honest and vulnerable as yours unless they\u2019re brave as hell.

Before this, I never felt the need to police his behavior, but now I struggle to trust him. Recently, I\u2019ve been noticing strange charges on our bank and credit card statements. When I ask my husband about them, he claims each time that the bank or company has made a mistake and he calls to have the charges reversed, but I\u2019m suspicious. I also found a letter from a bank denying my husband an increase in a credit limit he\u2019d requested \u2014 again, without telling me.\n\nWe have a peaceful and affectionate relationship, but I fear that his spending addiction needs major treatment. I don\u2019t know that he has our economic well-being in mind or if he\u2019s willing to be my partner in making a good life in the long term. What\u2019s your advice, Sugars?\n\nSpent\n\nCheryl Strayed: Your husband committed what\u2019s referred to as financial infidelity, Spent. Like sexual infidelity, the healing can\u2019t begin until the partner who committed the betrayal stops doing it. Your husband hasn\u2019t done that. He confessed to his secret debt not because he was ready to change but because he knew it would soon be revealed. He apologized and carried on as before. Now he\u2019s lying to you about what he claims are false charges on your accounts and he has also attempted to get more credit without your knowledge, presumably to accrue more debt, which is how he got into this trouble to begin with. I can\u2019t discern from your letter whether or not your husband has a spending addiction (though it sounds like he might). What\u2019s clear is that he\u2019s still deceiving you about his spending. You\u2019re wise to take this breach as seriously as you\u2019re taking it. His actions have damaged more than your credit rating. They\u2019ve damaged your trust.", "title": "My Husband Got Secret Credit Cards and Maxed Them Out", "authors": []}

An unintended consequence of their thoughtfulness is that I have spent much of my life correcting people who called me Frances. \u201cIt\u2019s Maggie, short for Margaret, my middle name,\u201d I said.\n\nBut in the hospital, it helped to have a second persona. Frances put on a brave face during the hours of treatment in sterilized facilities, while Maggie drew inward, refusing books and music or anything else that reminded me of who I was outside the hospital walls. From where I sat, pinned to machines by the needles in my veins, in a body I hardly recognized, and with a label on my wrist displaying a name that wasn\u2019t mine, I couldn\u2019t be sure that it was me this was really happening to. I listened patiently as doctors and nurses and technicians came into my room to offer Frances their well wishes, draw blood, or discuss what medications she should take or what procedures might make her body strong once more.\n\n[An Arizona farm has been blamed for part of the large, nationwide E.Coli outbreak. Read more here]\n\nDuring my first week of hospitalization, the kidney doctors debated whether to begin the dialysis process, sticking to the typical \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach. But by the end of the week there was no question. I had gained 30 pounds from all the excess fluid and could hardly stand up and walk on my own. I began my first of many three-hour-long dialysis treatments, where they siphoned off the liquid, doing the work of my kidneys that I had so long taken for granted.\n\nI had mostly avoided social media since getting sick, but one day, I logged onto Facebook to see that across the country, people I knew and people I didn\u2019t \u2014 a pair of girls I once babysat for, a football team in Rhode Island \u2014 were praying for Maggie, hoping Maggie pulled through. The more people that worried about me, the sicker I must be, I thought.\n\nThe dialysis continued for three weeks with tiny but measurable results. My platelet counts began to climb, and I started to pee again. But it wasn\u2019t enough to impress the nephrologists, who decided to surgically place a catheter in my chest, to both drain and administer fluids.\n\nDoctors began discussing a kidney transplant and temporary home-care dialysis training. I was sent home for a weekend to rest up before my first training for an eventual dialysis machine to be brought to my parents\u2019 house, but we didn\u2019t get that far. I went to bed after dinner and woke up in an ambulance racing back to the hospital I had just left.

It was not that I liked all of them personally more than I liked the men; many of the men were as charming as the most lovely women, and not all the women were so personable.\n\nIndeed one female senator once glared at me and called me awkward when I approached her in the hall for an interview, which made me feel levels of humiliation and rage that I had never felt after talking to a rude male senator.\n\nWas this my bias working in another way? I think so. How dare a woman who was my own age and a mother of children the same age as mine speak to me that way? Were we not in some sense peers?\n\nNo, in fact, we were not. Roughly half of all journalists these days are women. But female senators are like blue grosbeaks \u2014 not exactly rare birds but unusual enough to engender interest. My bias was toward their exalted perch.\n\nA grand total of 52 women have served as United States senators. With the recent appointment of Cindy Hyde-Smith, the first female senator from Mississippi, the body is at an all-time high with a mere 23 women \u2014 not even 25 percent of the Senate as a whole.\n\nHistorically, women have been harder to persuade to run for office than their male peers, and more loath to ask donors for money. (That\u2019s changing this year, with a historic number of women running.)\n\nMany women have been reluctant, I suspect, because of the questions they face about how they will raise their children while in a job that keeps them away from home. Male candidates do not face such questions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce in the Senate, women tend to stick with their party \u2014 as do men \u2014 but they have at times come together as a bloc on bills that the majority of their male peers are rejecting, or come together to clean up partisan messes. And every month, they have a formal bipartisan dinner together that has become one of the most intriguing institutional traditions in the Senate.\n\nFemale senators are often accused of being tough on staff. This is largely a matter of sexism. But I suspect something else is also at work. Getting to this level of the legislative branch is so grueling for women that by the time they arrive they might very well expect those around them to have sacrificed, too.\n\nI often wonder what motivates these women \u2014 especially Republicans, whose female ranks are thinner on the Hill \u2014 to set their sights on the Senate rather than, say, governors\u2019 mansions, and what they take from the experience.\n\nOn Sunday in New York, I will get to ask four of them: Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota; Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa; and Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota.\n\nI expect to be surprised by this group of extraordinary women, whose paths were paved long ago by senators\u2019 widows who endured comments about their stockings long before their bills made history.\n\nJennifer Steinhauer interviewed these \u201cWomen of the Senate\u201d as part of the TimesTalks 20th Anniversary Festival at the Times Center in New York on April 15.", "title": "My Relationship With the Women of the Senate", "authors": ["Jennifer Steinhauer"]}

He also wants to make good on a promise of a fourfold increase in development funds to FIFA\u2019s 211 member nations. He faces re-election next year.\n\nBut many members at the Bogot\u00e1 meeting were frustrated by Infantino\u2019s lack of candor as they met at the cavernous \u00c1gora Convention Center, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the meeting. Infantino said he had committed to a nondisclosure agreement, but he wanted the council\u2019s permission to push ahead to complete an agreement with the mystery group.\n\nFIFA declined to comment Monday.\n\nFew details are known about the potential deal, which would be for as many as three editions of the tournaments. But, according to the people with knowledge of the meeting, Infantino received a proposal earlier this year to bring the club tournament to China and Saudi Arabia, two nations that are committed to expanding their leisure and entertainment sectors.\n\nAt the FIFA Council meeting, members received a briefing on a proposal for an expanded Club World Cup, which is currently contested annually by the seven clubs who win their regional tournament. The briefing outlined plans for a quadrennial club tournament similar to the FIFA World Cup that would feature a minimum of 12 teams from Europe, home to sport\u2019s richest and most-popular clubs.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe document, however, gave no hint of the $25 billion investors offered. Infantino delivered that information verbally.\n\nEuropean representatives were resistant because the competition could compete with the UEFA Champions League, the wildly popular club championship for Europe. A group of African council members also withheld support because it was frustrated that FIFA had not been more supportive of Morocco\u2019s 2026 World Cup bid.\n\nAt a news conference after the meeting, Infantino, without referencing his talks with the consortium, said discussions about the future of FIFA\u2019s club competitions would continue, and would be addressed at the next council meeting, in Moscow in June. The current Club World Cup is worth less than $100 million.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Scudamore was writing in his capacity as chairman of the World Leagues Forum, a consortium representing top leagues from four continents.\n\nThe European Club Association, a group representing more than 200 of the continent\u2019s biggest clubs, rejected any plans to create a new club competition at its annual meeting in Rome last month. The E.C.A.\u2019s president, Andrea Agnelli, who is also chairman of the Italian club Juventus, said the clubs wanted fewer games, in order to protect player health. He said no new tournaments could be created before 2024. Infantino wants to launch the new club event in 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about the calendar going forward we must also take into consideration weeks when players can actually rest and or train,\u201d Agnelli said last month.\n\nFIFA has long coveted a worldwide club competition that would be as popular as the Champions League, which generates billions of dollars annually. UEFA will collect $15 billion during the current four-year cycle.

They also had the No. 4 pick over all, which they used to add cornerback Denzel Ward out of Ohio State.\n\nThe second round was scattered with several other notable picks:\n\nAt 37th over all, the Indianapolis Colts took Auburn\u2019s Braden Smith, their second offensive lineman of the draft, reflecting the need to keep their ailing quarterback, Andrew Luck, protected in the pocket.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans took Harold Landry of Boston College, a linebacker, at 42nd over all. Along with Alabama\u2019s Rashaan Evans, who was picked 22nd Thursday night, the Titans took two linebackers \u2014 which is the same position the first-year head coach Mike Vrabel played in the N.F.L., most notably for the Patriots.\n\nAfter trading the 32nd overall pick on Thursday night to the Baltimore Ravens, who used it on Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson, the Philadelphia Eagles traded up to select South Dakota State tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nWith the second round\u2019s 15th pick, the Arizona Cardinals took Texas A&M wide receiver Christian Kirk. A native of the Phoenix area, Kirk went lower than many expected. He is seen as a complement to, and perhaps an eventual successor to, Larry Fitzgerald, the heart of the Cardinals franchise. It is not clear whether Kirk will catch his first pass from Josh Rosen, the U.C.L.A. quarterback whom the Cardinals picked 10th over all on Thursday, or from the veteran Sam Bradford.\n\nDerrius Guice, the Louisiana State running back considered one of the biggest talents at his position, fell to nearly the end of the second round, the 59th overall pick, partly because of reports about unspecified off-field problems.

Browns Coach Hue Jackson said Thursday that Tyrod Taylor, the quarterback acquired in a trade with the Buffalo Bills, would be the presumptive starter this season.\n\nThe Browns are used to picking high, which illustrates a larger point about the franchise: It has a poor track record of converting enviable draft positions into star players.

He feels the stop-start nature of the sport could play to his strengths: \u201cRugby\u2019s such a get-up, get-down game, and playing that for 80 minutes is a lot for a 310-pound guy,\u201d he told NFL.com. Nate Ebner, an American rugby player until his junior year of college, made the transition and became a Patriots special teams contributor. But Ebner is a different kind of player, weighing 100 pounds less.\n\nThe Eagles were high enough on Mailata to trade up to get him. \u201cWith this guy, we don\u2019t know his floor, and we don\u2019t know his ceiling,\u201d General Manager Howie Roseman told Sports Illustrated. \u201cWith this guy, we\u2019re molding a piece of clay.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

Bawden was a quarterback when he arrived at college, before being shifted to fullback. He was mostly a specialist blocking back and finished his career with a total of 30 catches and 12 rushes in 24 games. He would figure for a specialty role in the N.F.L. as well, if he makes a roster.\n\n\u201cAt first, I really didn\u2019t believe that I could do it,\u201d he told The Detroit Free Press of his transition from quarterback. \u201cI was willing to give it a chance.

He got in seven regular season and three playoff games as a rookie for the Jaguars, where he wound up.\n\nBradley was aware he was bucking the odds. \u201cBeing a long snapper, it\u2019s not something that happens often,\u201d he told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n255. Austin Proehl, WR, North Carolina, Bills\n\nFor some reason, many of the stars who have emerged from round seven over the years were pass catchers: Harold Carmichael (1971), Shannon Sharpe (1990), Donald Driver (1999), Julian Edelman (2009).\n\nAustin Proehl will be aiming to join them, but he is still probably best known as the son of Ricky Proehl, who had a solid 17-year career in the N.F.L.\n\nBut history is not quite repeating.

It is the latest skirmish between the league and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the landmark settlement, which was supposed to provide support to players.\n\n\n\nThe league\u2019s claims of fraud and deception were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs of April 9, the settlement administrator had received 1,753 claims from the more than 20,000 retired players who registered. Of those claims, 233 have been approved for more than $228 million, before appeals and deductions. Most of the claims paid thus far were for players with A.L.S., Parkinson\u2019s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated blows to the head.\n\nThe N.F.L. said in its filings on Friday, though, that more than 400 claims had been denied because of \u201cunscrupulous doctors and lawyers\u201d who coached players on how to seem more mentally impaired. In some cases, retired players falsely claimed to have dementia.\n\n\n\nRetired players, the league filings said, \u201chave the right to be upset, but their concerns should be directed at those who sought to take advantage of the generosity of the Settlement Program for personal gain,\u201d not at the league or those administering the claim.\n\nThe settlement, which was first reached in 2013, has had other problems, including companies that have provided high-interest loans to players who agreed to repay them with money from their settlements.", "title": "N.F.L.

Veteran players like James Neal and Marc Andre-Fleury were rejuvenated by their new surroundings, while players like William Karlsson, Erik Haula and Colin Miller took full advantage of their expanded roles for the expansion franchise. The Knights split the season series with Los Angeles.\n\nThe Kings (45-29-8) made sweeping changes at higher levels of the organization by clearing out their general manager and coach in the off-season. They were buoyed by career seasons from defenseman Drew Doughty; Anze Kopitar, the team\u2019s current captain; and Dustin Brown, the team\u2019s former captain who had been in sharp decline. Brown and Kopitar turned in four-goal games down the stretch while Jonathan Quick provided timely goaltending in a tight playoff race. The Kings led the league in penalty kill percentage and allowed the fewest goals.\n\nNo. 2 Anaheim Ducks vs. No. 3 San Jose Sharks\n\nCalamity befell the Ducks (44-25-13) before the season even started, as they were missing their two top centers and three top defensemen. Goalie John Gibson has also been a frequent visitor to the trainer\u2019s table. Yet if the Ducks can get healthy, they may regain the form that saw them win five straight division crowns and make two trips to the Western Conference finals. The top defenseman Cam Fowler will likely miss this series with a shoulder injury, and Gibson\u2019s status is in question after he missed the last three games of the regular season.\n\nThe Sharks (45-27-10) have been without center Joe Thornton for the last 35 games because of a knee injury. And they backed into the postseason, winning just one of their final six games, though they did take three out of four meetings with Anaheim this season.

Other signs include pinpoint pupils, confusion, vomiting and cold or clammy skin.\n\nTrainers will frequently instruct people to perform what is known as a sternum rub.\n\n\u201cYou make a fist and with your knuckles you go up and down the sternum as hard as you can,\u201d said Mr. Childs. \u201cIt causes excruciating pain, so if someone does not respond to that, you know they are in a state worth responding to immediately.\u201d\n\nIf someone is awake, look at their eyes. \u201cMostly you see the iris, just a tiny black spot in the middle,\u201d said Dr. Steven Daviss, senior medical adviser at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good sign someone has overdosed on an opioid.\u201d\n\nAnother symptom to look for is a snoring noise; this can actually be the sound of someone gasping for breath.\n\nIf you think someone is overdosing, call 911, even if you administer naloxone.\n\nHow do you give someone naloxone?\n\nNaloxone comes in different forms.\n\nIf you are using the nasal spray version, commonly referred to by the brand name Narcan, tilt the patient\u2019s head back and spray it into the patient\u2019s nose. Most people will respond in a few minutes. People at trainings are often told to administer one dose, wait three minutes, do rescue breathing and then give a second dose if there is no response. They may be told to flip a patient on their side to prevent asphyxiation if the person vomits.\n\nInjectable naloxone, which can come in syringes or in \u201cauto-injectors,\u201d is a muscle shot and can be injected into the thigh, buttocks or arms.

Some states allow you to purchase it over the counter at stores like CVS and Walgreens, but others require a prescription.

The type of naloxone you can get often differs by state, pharmacy and what insurance you have. Many insurances cover naloxone, so you can ask to see what your share of the cost would be. Some public health programs also offer ways for people to get it for free or at a low cost, as do naloxone\u2019s manufacturers in some cases.\n\n\u201cThere is wide variation in the cost of naloxone,\u201d said Kemp Chester, associate director at the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. \u201cIt can be as cheap as $35 and as expensive as $100 plus.\u201d\n\nCan you give someone too much naloxone?\n\nNo. Naloxone is not addictive. It does force people into opioid withdrawal, so a person receiving it can be distraught, irritable and upset when they come to.\n\nBut if you give it to someone and it turns out they are not overdosing, don\u2019t worry. \u201cIt is not harmful to give it to someone who is not undergoing an overdose,\u201d said Mr. Chester.\n\nNaloxone only works for overdoses from opioids, not overdoses from other types of drugs.\n\nDo experts think this will save lives or help end the opioid crisis?\n\nNaloxone can save someone\u2019s life during an overdose, but it is not a cure for opioid addiction. Dr. Daviss said that a number of people who go to an emergency room after an overdose will die from a second, third or fourth overdose within a year. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hook them up into treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cMedication-assisted treatment is the way to go.\u201d", "title": "Naloxone Stops Opioid Overdoses.

His father, Raymond Davis, was a boxer; his mother, Rosemary Gates, who raised him, was a nurse. He began his career in the band of the pianist Jay McShann, who had helped propel Parker to stardom.\n\nMr. Davis graduated from the University of Kansas, where he studied music education. Years later, while teaching at Pittsburgh, he earned a Ph.D. in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University in Connecticut.\n\nIn the 1980s he formed the Paris Reunion Band, a midsize ensemble featuring heavyweight musicians who had played on the Paris scene in the 1960s, among them the saxophonist Joe Henderson and Mr. Shaw.\n\nIn a review of a performance in 1986, John S.

I understand it\u2019s the Nationals. But like I said, you sit back and say, these first 16 games, we\u2019re 12-4.

On Tuesday, it was a failure to hit with runners on base. The Mets went 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position, even after they chased Washington\u2019s starting pitcher, Gio Gonzalez, in the sixth inning. Gonzalez has been nearly perfect at Citi Field, with a 10-1 record and a 1.69 E.R.A. in 15 starts.\n\nHe only allowed two runs in five and one-third innings, and that was enough to win.

After one-out singles by Yoenis Cespedes and Wilmer Flores, the Mets had runners at first and third. Now, perhaps, it was their chance for a dramatic comeback.\n\nBut Ryan Madson, the veteran relief pitcher, struck out Frazier and Jay Bruce to escape the danger. The Nationals added another run in the top of the eighth to ease the pressure on their bullpen, which did its job in holding the Mets to a lone single over the last two innings.\n\nPart of the reason some Mets fans reacted so adversely to Monday\u2019s loss was the state of the Nationals\u2019 injury-depleted roster: Daniel Murphy (knee), Adam Eaton (ankle) and Anthony Rendon (toe) were out of action.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get there,\u201d Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said before the game. \u201cThese guys, I know they\u2019re progressing.

They had enough trouble dealing with Bryce Harper, who had homered in three straight games against the Mets. He went hitless on Tuesday, but knocked in the first run of the game with a sacrifice fly in the third inning, and he walked twice.\n\nThe Nationals added two more runs in the fourth inning as Wheeler walked Michael A. Taylor and Wilmer Difo floated a ball into right field, just over the head of Mets second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera, scoring Moises Sierra. Taylor went to third and scored on a single to left by Pedro Severino.\n\nThe Nats still had runners at first and second with nobody out, but Gonzalez failed to get down a bunt, and Wheeler got Turner to fly out to left. Next, Wheeler faced Howie Kendrick with Harper on deck. But Wheeler escaped, as Kendrick bounced a ball weakly toward third and Frazier made the unassisted out to avoid the potentially disastrous situation of Harper coming up with the bases loaded.\n\nIt was not nearly enough on a night when Gonzalez was typically strong at Citi Field. Even when the Mets had runners on base, Gonzalez often executed the right pitches at critical times to get out of trouble. He stranded a runner at second base in the first inning, and in the third inning the Mets had runners at first and second with one out and first and third with two outs, and could not score.\n\nTheir failure to break through then, and again in the seventh against Madson, meant the Mets lost for the second straight day, providing pessimistic fans more opportunity to worry.", "title": "Nationals Send the Mets to (Gasp!)

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "In our writing prompt \u201cDo You Vape?,\u201d we wanted to know if vaping is a problem at your school and, if so, what could be done about it.\n\n\n\nEmily Lane Player from Hoggard High School says vaping is a major issue at her school:\n\nYes, I am included in the epidemic of vaping devices affecting teenagers today. Why? Ask our Gen X parents, who smoked cigarettes. Or our baby boomer grandparents, who smoked cigarettes as well. It seems that teenagers always gravitate towards trying new things that their peers are doing. Although I don\u2019t own a vaping device myself, almost all of my friends do. If you walk into the girls bathroom at any given time you will see 5+ girls crowded in a stall, all vaping together. In the bathroom near the cafeteria, the handicapped stall is widely regarded as the \u201cvaping stall.\u201d Someone even wrote, \u201cVape gods only!\u201d on the wall. The issue here is no teenager will regard it as an issue. Almost everyone I know vapes regularly, or has at least tried it. However, I only know a handful of people who have smoked cigarettes. Many kids don\u2019t know the detrimental effects that vape devices have on your health, and frankly, many of them don\u2019t care, because they think cigarettes are much worse. Though I applaud the efforts of Cape Elizabeth High School to help kids who are struggling with addiction, I honestly don\u2019t think that will make a difference. If teens are already vaping, they aren\u2019t going to stop. Instead, we should focus on teaching kids not to vape in the first place. There is such a stigma around cigarettes that many teens view it as \u201cgross\u201d or \u201ctrashy\u201d if someone smokes them. There should be the same stigma around vaping so that kids won\u2019t be tempted to try it in the first place.\n\nCharlie A from pembroke, N.H., says his school is struggling to deal with vaping, too, and thinks there is a need for harsher punishments:\n\nI do not vape but my school has a major problem with it. There are always several students that are skipping class and they are vaping. There has always been students smoking at the school but vaping is now doing it none stop. The schools consonsinquenes are not doing anything. Students will get caught and they will just take and gather in a different spot to continue to vape. The school has only suspended the students for a short period of time and they still just take and find another way to bring the vape right back in to the school. The schools need to make the punishment harsh by suspending the students they catch vaping, confiscate the vape, and make the students do something like community service or even clean the school just because they were vaping. Other students need to speak up if they see someone vaping and report it. The vapes are so popular because students think that by vaping it makes them cooler.\n\nRosser Baxley from Wilmington, N.C., sees stress as the major contributor to the epidemic:\n\nOf course I knew about the health effects of vaping but that doesn\u2019t stop us. I\u2019m not surprised with anything in this article and I am sure that everyone at my school who vapes will say the same. So the question from all staff and parents is why do we do it? Well let\u2019s be honest, every generation has their \u201cdrug\u201d or addiction. Schools have tried to crack down on this problem but at the end of the day, there are so many people vaping that I believe that ending the vaping in schools is a lost cause. School if stressful and we practically drive ourselves crazy going through the same routine without anyway to escape from it. For many people vaping is their escape. You can practically get a three minute buzz from hitting a \u201cflash drive\u201d without your teacher catching you. I agree with Kate Zernike with the fact that we vape because students want to \u201crebel\u201d or break loose but let\u2019s accept the fact that vaping has is being used to cope with our strenuous school routine.\n\nEmilia Cordon from Wilmington, N.C., suggested that teenagers don\u2019t realize the risks of e-cigarettes pose to their health:\n\nPersonally, I do not see the allure in vaping but see it as a serious health concern in schools and teens. I know people in my school that vape and see it as an uprising problem. I understand that students are stressed and see vaping as a safer option to smoking or drugs, but it is in a way more dangerous because of this. Kids think it\u2019s safer so they are more inclined to do it and to do it frequently. Dr. Mark L. Rubinstein says that due to the lack of research, people can\u2019t identify the risks like they can with smoking, which has had years of research, but the little research that has been done shows scary results. This causes people to falsely assume that it is safer just because there haven\u2019t been extensive studies like cigarettes. It\u2019s concerning that e-cigarette companies direct their sales toward the youth, knowing that they don\u2019t know the side effects. There needs to be more regulation on what these companies can do so we can prevent youth addiction.\n\nBut, Eason from Wilmington, N.C., had this theory as to why so many young people today are taking up vaping:\n\nI kind of laughed at this article. It\u2019s interesting to see how adults perceive this issue and our reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s the one risky thing that you can do in your life \u2014 with little consequence, in their mind \u2014 to show that you\u2019re a little bit of a rebel.\u201d I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I can speak for my friends and I, who have our juul\u2019s shoved up our sleeves and write on bathroom walls \u201cvape gods only\u201d, that we are completely aware and completely unconcerned with the consequences. We are not addicted however to the nicotine, we are addicted to any and everything that is a breath of fresh are, anything that makes us feel little less like clones to our school system. We roam the roads at 4 in the morning stealing traffic cones and 79 cent drink signs from gas stations all while sucking so hard on a mango pod that your whole body gets pins and needles from the nicotine. We get so bored in class we see how many hits it takes to not be able to walk straight. We do everything our parents told us not to because we might as well have raised ourselves. We do everything our teachers tell us not to because we could run our high school better than any of the oblivious adults that sit behind their desks. The more time I spend in a classroom listening to people being \u201cprofound\u201d the more I want to go 80 out of the parking lot with my head out the sunroof screaming to let all the prisoners know that we escaped. Instead I breathe in mint vapor and doze off to the sound of my teachers voice.\n\nSo how should schools deal with this problem? Ellie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., recommended using a variety of approaches:\n\nThe smoke may disappear within seconds but the issue of vaping in schools is a constant struggle. At first it shocked me how many people at my high school vaped, but I quickly became desensitized to it. I began noticing people all around me vaping - the shocking part wasn\u2019t that they were vaping, rather that they would do it right underneath the teacher\u2019s nose. Take a quick glance to the back corner of the classroom and you will most likely find someone trying to stealthily vape while the teacher is preoccupied. Abolishing the issue of vaping by threatening to suspend or expel students may work in some cases because most students (first-timers) fear ruining their records. However, there is a population of students who have developed an addiction to vaping and punishments may result in students rebelling and vaping more. Administrators should seek to help students with addictions and teach them about the health consequences. Just like how the vice principal in the article hadn\u2019t noticed the students at his school vaping until he was directly addressed with a student who admitted to it, there is no easy way to completely solve this issue but we have to be more aware of what is happening right under our noses.\n\nJessica Brevil from Wekiva high, Apopka believes that offering therapy and education will help students make better choices:\n\nBefore reading this article, I did not even know what vaping was. I do not feel that vaping is a problem at my school. I have never heard of a situation where a student at my school got suspended for this particular problem. May I also add that suspension is the worst resolution to the problem. The immense psychological issue that correlates to vaping is much too extraordinary to be resolved under suspension. I do, however, like the implementation of therapy as a solution to vaping in schools, it is much more effective than suspension. I also want to bring up the Idea of exposure to the education of these vaping sources as a solution. I believe that a potential cause of the growth of vapers is peer pressure and more specifically gearing to pressure to engage in an unknown substance. If I, for example, had to be given vaping product by peers, I would be ignorant to the potential dangers in the substances. My ignorance could have led to peer influence by which my peer could have presented the substance to me as something harmless and I may have indulged in the substance as a result of my ignorance. The message that I want to reflect is that teens need that kind of education before the problem get uncontrollable so that they don\u2019t fall under their own ignorance.\n\nAnd Hayley DeArmond says that e-cigarettes need to be less accessible to teenagers:\n\nI know a fair number of people who vape, young and old. I have never been supportive of any ideas of smoking whether it is under the facade of a \u201cmore safe\u201d technological device or not. I think that the variety in how much money people spend on cigarettes over E-cigarettes is not large, but I do know some people who vaping has helped reduce their smoking habits. Even with Ashley Gould, the chief administrative officer of Juul saying: \u201cOur product is not only not for kids,\u201d does not feel genuine. Gould may genuinely not want legal trouble, but creating a curriculum that includes mindfulness exercises is not enough to solve this issue. The accessibility of E-cigarettes and the easy ability to carry and hide from the size of Juuls, add nicotine into the mix and you got a problem o your hands. The problem is that E-cigarettes are much better at creating addicts than stopping them. Making E-cigarettes less accessible and spreading views that do not encourage E-cigarette use may help, but just as cigarettes are a cultural problem E-cigarettes will need to be resolved similarly.\n\n_________", "title": "Nature Fixes, Sports Betting, Teacher Walkouts and Guns: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

In cool, meticulous prose, Matar documents the exquisite joy of the exile\u2019s return, and the depth of a grief that knows no closure.

Being left with nothing or starting out with nothing \u2014 however you want to look at it \u2014 they\u2019ve found ways to come up with some talent after the franchise lost all of those first-round picks in that deal with Boston.\n\nWith a break here or there, they would have had 30 wins this season because they\u2019ve lost so many heartbreaking games down the stretch in the fourth quarter or overtime. Win a couple of those and they\u2019re at 30 wins, which is way more than people would have predicted at the beginning of the season.\n\nThe toughest thing, I think, in a situation like the Nets are in, is to stay the course and not deviate.

Sometimes you can\u2019t see success because we are looking at wins and losses from the outside, but internally it\u2019s almost like what Philadelphia did: you have to wait it out, pick up some top draft choices and coach them up.

National leaders, outside groups and statewide officials have launched a concerted effort targeting four of the five New Jersey districts held by Republicans, including the Third Congressional District where Mr. Kim is running.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlready, two Republicans \u2014 Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank LoBiondo \u2014 have announced retirement, while a third, Representative Leonard Lance, has had his race declared a tossup by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes elections.\n\nSuper PACs and labor groups are mapping out plans for New Jersey, though they are mostly waiting until after the party primaries in June before making official endorsements or announcements about resources devoted to the races.\n\n\u201cWe view New Jersey House races as some of the best pickup opportunities in the country,\u201d said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Priorities USA, one of the largest progressive super PACs, \u201cand are keeping an eye on them as we decide where to play in the future.\u201d\n\nStill, despite the Democratic mobilization motivated by Mr. Trump, Democrats in New Jersey face a difficult road. Mr. Kim, for example, is seeking to unseat Representative Tom MacArthur, a wealthy self-funded Republican who has been so well entrenched in his district that the Democrats barely put up a fight in 2016. No matter the anger at the White House, Mr. MacArthur can count on strong support from reliably Republican areas like Ocean County and the Cook Political Report has continued to rate the district as \u201clikely Republican.\u201d\n\nBut all those headwinds have not dampened the enthusiasm or financial support for Mr. Kim\u2019s long-shot effort in this district, which cuts across the southern part of the state, from Burlington County to Ocean County. As of April 1, the first-time candidate with a background in national security has raised over $1.1 million with donations trickling in from all 50 states.\n\nMr. MacArthur does have some vulnerabilities, having voted with Mr. Trump more often than anyone else in the state\u2019s delegation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Third District, some voters say their dislike for Mr. Trump has colored their view of Mr. MacArthur, who voted in favor of the tax law and was instrumental in the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy problem with MacArthur is that he\u2019s not protecting us, with health care and taxes and guns, he\u2019s doing affirmative damage to me and this district,\u201d said Susan Lavine, 64, a small-business owner from Moorestown, N.J. Ms. Lavine said she voted for Mr. MacArthur in the past two elections because, \u201cI thought he was a moderate.\u201d But she has since changed her mind and is now supporting Mr. Kim.\n\nDespite Mr. MacArthur\u2019s support for the tax bill and his opposition to the affordable care act, his campaign said that his voting record has tended to be more moderate and that his work on local issues, such as financing for a military base in the district, will mean more than the political polarization fomented by the Trump White House.\n\n\u201cThose are the kinds of issues that voters in Burlington look to as to what defines moderate for them, as opposed to some group in Washington,\u201d said Chris Russell, a strategist for the MacArthur campaign.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Murphy last year, Kim Guadagno, won the district by the same margin Mr. Trump did in 2016, which Mr. MacArthur\u2019s campaign said shows that the district remains loyal to the G.O.P.\n\nNational Republicans are also confident that when the election gets closer, and the stakes of the local elections become more clear, enthusiasm will ramp up among their base. And in New Jersey, they argue, the familiarity of the incumbent on a local level could be an advantage, as opposed to the relative unknown of someone like Rick Saccone, who lost in the Pennsylvania special election last month.\n\n\u201cHaving your own brand, and having people know who you are is extremely important,\u201d said Matt Gorman, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said well-known incumbents are also able to run on issues, rather than simply against the president, as they work to galvanize voters. \u201cThat\u2019s why people like Lance and others were able to win seats in districts that Clinton won in 2016,\u201d Mr. Gorman said.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Kim has enjoyed widespread support, including the endorsement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., underscoring the shifting political dynamics in New Jersey.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the first time in about a decade, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is focused on more than two Republican-held seats, its typical strategy, and is taking aim at all five, though the seat held by one Republican, Chris Smith in the Fourth Congressional District, is considered safe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Biden announced recently that he was also endorsing Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat running in Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s district.\n\nIn the 11th district, Ms. Sherrill has attracted national attention with her impressive biography \u2014 a former Navy helicopter pilot and a former federal prosecutor \u2014 and she has raised more than $1.2 million in 2017 alone. In the Second District, which Mr. LoBiondo held for more than 20 years, Jeff Van Drew, a state senator, has quickly attracted the endorsements of major statewide political players, including George E. Norcross, a powerful South Jersey power broker.\n\nBesides a national mobilization to win Democratic seats in New Jersey, candidates are also benefiting from Mr. Murphy\u2019s determination to strengthen his party\u2019s dominance in the state. He appointed the former finance director of his campaign, Liz Gilbert, to be the state Democratic Party\u2019s executive director and he has directed the state party to invest more heavily in this year\u2019s elections than it customarily would.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want that to end in November when he won election,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said of Mr. Murphy\u2019s desire to keep his political machine cranking. \u201cHe wanted it to be part of his governing as well.\u201d\n\nAt the fund-raiser for Mr. Kim, the optimism that the state\u2019s suburbs were tilting in the Democrats\u2019 favor was palpable.\n\n\u201cIn Toms River, where it\u2019s totally Republican all the time, Democrats just picked up three council seats,\u201d said Barbara Ann Reilly, the president of the Brick Democratic Club, referring to elections last year. \u201cI even had a group of Republicans that came to my fund-raiser and sponsored a table.\u201d", "title": "New Jersey Becomes a Key Battleground in Race for House Control", "authors": ["Nick Corasaniti"]}

Lupu, a law professor at George Washington University who closely followed the Trinity Lutheran case.

{"date": "2018-04-12 00:00:00", "text": "But, to date, new progress has been slow. States like California and New York already had progressive clean-energy policies that were well underway before Mr. Trump took office. And few states have managed to significantly step up policy action; efforts to put a price on carbon failed to pass through legislatures in Washington and Oregon this year.\n\nBut in New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy has seen some success, and these energy bills, which the governor has indicated he will sign, mark a significant step. Having made environmental issues a focus of both his campaign and his early tenure, Mr. Murphy has already signed numerous executive orders, including one that laid the groundwork for expanding offshore wind energy near Atlantic City.\n\nWhile his administration has struggled to sell the tax increases arising from his inaugural budget to fellow Democrats, he has largely had success when it comes to moving the state forward in combating climate change.\n\n\u201cThe environmental reality in this state for the past eight years, and if that weren\u2019t enough, the environmental chops of the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in an interview, \u201cfelt like an urgent crisis.\u201d\n\nThe inclusion of the nuclear subsidy, though, has dampened enthusiasm among some environmental groups for the package of measures, exposing the rift among those who view nuclear energy as inherently clean \u2014 in that it has no greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 and those who view the industry as a threat because of safety, regulation and waste disposal issues.\n\nMr. Murphy is wholly in favor of nuclear energy.\n\n\u201cI believe the biggest bridge we have to our clean energy future are the nukes and, not to mention, the thousands of jobs they support,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambitious goals set forth in the renewable energy bill have caused concern among some environmental groups usually opposed to nuclear energy. But the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been supportive of New Jersey\u2019s efforts toward renewable energy, has said it will not oppose the nuclear subsidy bill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Across the United States, there are still 99 nuclear power plants in operation that supply one-fifth of the nation\u2019s electricity without generating any carbon dioxide emissions. Six reactors have closed since 2013 and more than a dozen more are scheduled to retire by 2025 unless states decide otherwise.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s nuclear subsidy bill is similar to programs passed recently in New York and Illinois, where the Legislature would give the nuclear power plants financial credit for the carbon-free electricity they produce. Every three years, the companies that operate these reactors will have to open their books and show that they need the subsidies to stay operational.\n\nIn New Jersey, the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor is expected to close, but the subsidies would benefit the remaining three.\n\nStill, some environmentalists in New Jersey have scoffed at this plan, viewing it as falling short in transparency for not requiring the utility companies to open their books to the public. And, they assert, the inclusion of the nuclear subsidy taints the clean-energy efforts in the companion bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to put a chilling effect on spending more for renewable energy, because to build out renewable will cost much more,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cThis bill is about a nuclear subsidy, and that\u2019s the primary purpose. And that\u2019s the diversion to make you think you\u2019re getting something that you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThe two bills will likely lead to an increase for New Jersey utility ratepayers, though the exact amount remains murky. The cost of subsidizing nuclear energy will be passed down to each ratepayer at a fee of approximately $41 a year, but Mr. Murphy has said he hopes to require public utilities to slash rates based on savings from the new federal tax law, which could potentially offset any increase.\n\nThe ambitious goals for renewable energy also follow a trend among the cities and states that have pledged to commit to upholding the Paris accord: By exceeding their share of the national commitments that would have existed under the international agreement, the states are accelerating the country\u2019s overall progress, despite the headwinds from Washington.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the United States commitments under Paris, these percentages would more than uphold New Jersey\u2019s share of the burden,\u201d said Robert C. Orr, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris Agreement as the United Nations secretary general\u2019s lead climate adviser. He is now dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland.\n\n\u201cObviously, New Jersey is a significant state, but it\u2019s not a driver in the same sense that California is,\u201d Mr. Orr said. \u201cBut by putting New Jersey in a group with California and New York and then Vermonts and the Marylands, you start to see, not getting all the way to Paris targets, but you start to see the trend line moving toward us meeting Paris.\u201d", "title": "New Jersey Takes a Big Step Toward Renewable Energy (and Nuclear Gets Help, for Now)", "authors": ["Nick Corasaniti", "Brad Plumer"]}

The suggestion when something \u201cgets to you\u201d is different: Now there\u2019s an actual distance, you over here and the world over there, and only slowly, laboriously, can a feeling make its way across that gulf to reach you.\n\nThat gulf is precisely what this song is about. It outlines what might be a familiar feeling: First you spend a long time contentedly alone, happily occupied with your own mind, eating among the solitary people at the counters of diners while everyone else arrives in groups and pairs. And then, very suddenly, it strikes you that this has become a problem: You have removed yourself from humanity, made yourself uncomfortable and strange, awkward-limbed and unsettled by the quiet, alone in ways that are beginning to wear.\n\nRose does us the favor of making this realization feel more gleeful than upsetting.

The cap on deductions of state and local taxes will hit especially hard in high-income, high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, places that, by coincidence or design, did not embrace President Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nCapping those deductions at $10,000 will certainly be felt in the metropolitan area, where property taxes of $20,000 to $30,000, on top of state income taxes, are not uncommon. New York and other states are considering litigation to fight the cap. And some others are exploring measures similar to those that passed in New York\u2019s budget.\n\nBut by being first out of the gate, New York\u2019s plan will be the test case.\n\nSeveral states have considered allowing municipalities to form nonprofit organizations that property owners would make payments to in lieu of property taxes, and then claim the \u201cdonations\u201d as charitable write-offs on their federal taxes. The I.R.S. has not issued any formal guidance on those ideas, but Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the New York law will push the issue, and he called the plan \u201clegally fraught.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite possible that now that New York has adopted such legislation through the budget, and other states are considering it, that we may see I.R.S. guidance clearly disallowing this,\u201d Mr. Walczak said. \u201cExisting case law already makes this plain, but states have muddied the water.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the state\u2019s plan \u2014 converting the income tax paid by wage earners to a payroll tax paid by companies that could then deduct that amount on their federal taxes \u2014 seems to be on firmer legal footing.

{"date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "text": "Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, issued a statement saying that given the importance of the job, the New York Fed should have solicited a wide set of views, but instead \u201cturned the process over to a handful of private individuals and ignored calls to choose one of many qualified alternatives who might have brought a new perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Fed wants to regain some of its credibility around this decision,\u201d she added, \u201cit should have Mr. Williams and the co-chairs of the New York Fed search committee promptly testify before Congress.\u201d\n\nThose leading the search said they had indeed cast a wide net, and advocates for Mr. Williams argue he is well suited to the complex role. He has led the San Francisco bank for seven years and has spent virtually his entire career inside the Fed system. He is an influential expert on monetary policy who has worked closely with progressives \u2014 including Janet L. Yellen, who before her term as Fed chairwoman was Mr. Williams\u2019s predecessor at the San Francisco Fed \u2014 and with conservatives such as John B. Taylor, the Stanford economist.\n\n\u201cHis work is rigorous and thoughtful, and he discusses it carefully, considers other views,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, who was Mr. Williams\u2019s thesis adviser in graduate school. Ms. Yellen also released a statement on Tuesday praising Mr. Williams\u2019s selection.\n\nMr. Williams would also bring a seasoned policymaking hand to a Fed that is short on them. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s newly appointed chairman, has been at the Fed since 2012, but he is a lawyer by training and not \u2014 unlike Ms. Yellen and most of her recent predecessors \u2014 an economist. The Fed\u2019s vice chairmanship is vacant, and the candidate President Trump has been reported to favor, Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist, has little policy experience. Three other positions on the seven-member board of governors are also vacant, and several regional bank presidents are new in their roles.\n\nThe relative inexperience at the top of the Fed made finding someone with practical experience a priority, two people close to the search process said. The search committee, these people said, wanted a candidate who understood the Fed\u2019s inner workings and who would protect the Fed\u2019s independence.\n\nBut Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist and former Fed staff member, said there are also risks to picking an insider. Fed officials failed to appreciate the risks posed by the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, for example, even as some outside voices tried to raise the alarm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe problem with picking a longtime Fed insider is it just amplifies the risk of groupthink,\u201d Mr. Levin said, \u201cand I think groupthink has been proven to be a very serious threat at the Fed.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams also has less experience with financial markets than many past New York Fed chiefs. The bank\u2019s president and its staff are traditionally responsible for communicating Fed decisions to Wall Street, and for interpreting financial markets\u2019 reactions for Fed policymakers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, board members who represent financial institutions regulated by the Fed are excluded from the appointment process.\n\nMr. Williams\u2019s appointment was also approved by the Fed\u2019s board of governors.\n\nIn a statement announcing the decision, Mr. Hutchins praised Mr. Williams as someone who has a rare mix of policy expertise and management experience and who \u201cunderstands the plumbing of the financial system.\u201d In a call with reporters, Mr. Hutchins and Ms. Horowitz also cited Mr. Williams\u2019s record of community engagement in San Francisco and his progress in diversifying the bank\u2019s senior leadership.\n\nProgressive groups seized on Mr. Dudley\u2019s retirement as a rare opportunity to influence an economic policy appointment that is outside Mr. Trump\u2019s control. Protesters marched on the bank\u2019s Lower Manhattan headquarters last month to demand a president who would represent working people.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the Fed Up campaign, a progressive group, criticized the New York Fed\u2019s board for \u201cignoring the demands of the public and choosing yet another white man whose record on Wall Street regulation and full employment raises serious questions.\u201d The group said the search process \u201ccalls into question whether the Federal Reserve can be trusted to act in the public interest.\u201d\n\nYet in one sense, the protesters got their wish. Unlike Mr. Dudley, who was chief economist for Goldman Sachs before he joined the Fed, Mr. Williams has never worked on Wall Street. And some of his positions have drawn cheers from progressives. He has, for example, pushed the central bank to consider a new approach to monetary policy that could lead the Fed to be more aggressive in fighting the next recession.\n\nBut Mr. Williams has also supported gradually raising interest rates to stave off inflation, an approach that progressive economists worry could prematurely choke off the economic recovery. And his regulatory record is also drawing scrutiny: He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge. (Regulatory policy is set in Washington, and Fed insiders say regional bank presidents play only a limited role overseeing banks in their districts.)\n\nPerhaps the loudest criticism has focused on the fact that Mr. Williams, like every other person to lead the New York Fed in the bank\u2019s century of history, is a white man.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe New York Fed has never been led by a woman or a person of color, and that needs to change,\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said in a statement last week.\n\nThe search committee promised to consider a diverse pool of candidates, and the two leaders of the search said they had succeeded. Neither of the other two finalists for the job \u2014 Raymond McGuire, an executive at Citigroup, and Mary J. Miller, a former Treasury official \u2014 is a white man, and the search committee also interviewed other candidates who would have brought diversity to the Fed. One such candidate, Peter Blair Henry, who recently stepped down as dean of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said that the search committee had pushed him to pursue the job, but that he had declined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just one data point, but if the effort they put into trying to persuade me to be a candidate is any indication, then they took diversity pretty seriously,\u201d said Mr. Henry, who like Mr. McGuire is African-American.\n\nBut Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who has studied the Fed, questioned whether there were really so few qualified candidates who weren\u2019t white men. And she said that the closed-door nature of the process made it hard for the public to evaluate how the search committee had carried out its work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an opaque and pretty byzantine process,\u201d Ms. Binder said. \u201cThe fact that it is so cloistered from public view and really has very little if any public accountability for how that choice is made \u2014 given the importance of the position, it\u2019s really quite glaring.\u201d", "title": "New York Fed Names John Williams President, Bucking Calls for Diversity", "authors": ["Ben Casselman"]}

{"date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "text": "Indeed, despite the governor\u2019s carefully staged kumbaya moment, there are many logistical, political and practical questions about what the future holds for the reunited Democrats and what changes might be afoot.\n\nThe most immediate answer, of course, is not much: Despite the I.D.C.\u2019s eight senators joining with Ms. Stewart-Cousins\u2019s 21 members, the Democrats are still short of a majority in the 63-seat chamber, something that Republicans who control the chamber were quick to note, and mock, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSimple math tells you that 29 out of 63 is not a majority,\u201d said Senator Rich Funke, an upstate Republican, who also called Mr. Cuomo\u2019s announcement \u201cworst deal to take place in New York City since the Yankees\u2019 10-year deal with A-Rod.\u201d\n\nThe possible addition of two more Democrats through special elections on April 24 will still leave the party just shy of the magic 32 needed for a majority because of the continued defection of State Senator Simcha Felder, a Brooklyn Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans. On Wednesday, Mr. Felder, too, seemed to tamp down expectations, repeating that while he had no loyalty to any party, he seemed happy enough with the G.O.P. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that I would have to feel a compelling reason to leave,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, there are some indications that things will be different \u2014 particularly for members of Mr. Klein\u2019s now-defunct faction \u2014 when the Legislature returns to Albany on April 16. Thanks to their agreement with the G.O.P., members of the I.D.C. had enjoyed the perks of committee chairmanships, which come with the power to steer legislation and handsome bonuses (known as \u201clulus\u201d in Albany parlance). Two members of Mr. Klein\u2019s conference had also been paid as vice-chairs of committees, a practice the state comptroller ruled improper in recent weeks.\n\nBut those chairmanships are likely to be taken away by the Republican leader, State Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, who is said to have only heard about the pending reunification early Wednesday from Mr. Klein, his longtime political partner. The I.D.C. also had enjoyed other benefits, including larger staffs and offices; the status of those perks is still under discussion, according to Scott Reif, a spokesman for Mr. Flanagan.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Mr. Klein himself seemed to confirm this, saying, \u201cClearly, things are going to change.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Thursday, at Foley Square in Manhattan, a succession of Democratic primary challengers to I.D.C. members blasted the deal as \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d particularly because it came after the passage of the state\u2019s $168 billion budget, during which time Mr. Klein \u2014 then regarded as one of four leaders in top-level negotiations \u2014 was still cooperating with Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to remember those who were in bed with the Republicans \u2014 the party of Trump,\u201d said Allan Roskoff, the president of the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club, which advocates for gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual rights.\n\nOthers \u2014 including Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Democratic challenger, the actress Cynthia Nixon \u2014 have also suggested that the timing of reconciliation was orchestrated to inoculate the governor and the I.D.C. from primary challenges, a theme picked up by Republicans as well. (One speaker at the Foley Square event called the I.D.C. deal \u201cthe Democratic Primary Discouragement Act.\u201d)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d said Mr. Reif. \u201cThe only reason that any of this is happening now is because Andrew Cuomo is scared to death of Cynthia Nixon.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuomo and his surrogates rejected this narrative, saying they had been working on a deal between Ms. Stewart-Cousins and Mr. Klein since last summer, and had fostered a tentative deal in November. \u201cIt had nothing to do with it,\u201d the governor said on Wednesday, in response to a question about Ms. Nixon.\n\nThe governor has also emphasized that the deal he announced is actually secondary to efforts in the fall to elect a wave of Democrats at every governmental level.\n\nHow the Senate might operate on a daily basis is also an open question. Under rules adopted for this session, the I.D.C. is regarded as a separate conference in the chamber and part of a ruling coalition. Indeed, even if Mr. Felder were to side with Democrats, Republicans argue that rules might not allow a change in majority leadership, because rules cannot be changed without 38 votes, beyond even unified Democrats. Democrats disagree, but legal battles could follow.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the Senate \u2014 and its now shifting loyalties \u2014 has also led to speculation that little, if anything, will get done between now and the end of the legislative session in June.\n\nOn Thursday, no physical changes were visible in Albany; Mr. Klein\u2019s suite of offices, on the top floor of a legislative office building, were intact. Mr. Klein said he expected to conference with his fellow Democrats in the Senate when the Legislature returns to work. He said he would also dip into the I.D.C.\u2019s campaign funds \u2014 some $1.2 million as of January \u2014 to support Democrats, as well as fending off primary challenges to his fellow I.D.C. alumni.\n\nMr. Klein said he remained proud of what the I.D.C. had accomplished \u2014 voting to pass things like paid family leave, a raise in the minimum wage and same-sex marriage \u2014 over its seven years of dissidence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI still believe, at the time,\u201d he said, \u201cit was a good thing.\u201d", "title": "New York\u2019s Democrats Ended a 7-Year Civil War.

The right to an itemized bill in plain English.\n\nPatients can\u2019t detect and dispute improper charges if their bills involve dozens of pages of medical abbreviations. Studies have found that 30 percent to over 50 percent of hospital bills contain errors. I interviewed a parent whose bill included thousands for his newborn\u2019s circumcision \u2014 even though his son was never circumcised. If a contractor charged you for a kitchen when he only renovated the bathroom, it would be fraud. When hospitals do the same it\u2019s regarded as an honest mistake. I have seen the bill a patient got for a hip replacement in Belgium. It is easier for me to understand than an American bill even though it\u2019s in Flemish.\n\nImage\n\n2. The right to never receive a surprise out-of-network bill.\n\nOne New Jersey couple went to a hospital, a doctor and an anesthesiologist within their insurance network for the birth of their daughter. But when their newborn had trouble breathing, requiring a stint in intensive care, they discovered that the pediatricians there were not in any network, resulting in a surprise bill for $10,000. A number of states are passing laws to shield individuals from surprise charges. But the laws put the onus on the patient to dispute the bill. The providers can still attempt to collect, and they do so aggressively.\n\nImage\n\n3. The right to accurate information about the provider network in my insurance plan.\n\nDoctors must be clearly in-network or not.

If my doctor or insurer stops participating in my network within that year or in the midst of treating me for an acute disease, I should still be billed as an in-network patient.

Then that therapist leaves the network or the patient is scheduled with a different therapist who doesn\u2019t participate, resulting in a $450 bill.\n\nImage\n\n5. The right to be informed of conflicts of interest.\n\nPatients should know if their doctors own a financial stake in a testing or procedure facility before a test or procedure is ordered or scheduled.

It brightened its usually drab pages with 62 color photographs from the historic event.\n\nIt even printed the leaders\u2019 joint declaration professing a goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nBut, like other state-run North Korean news media, the newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, gave no hint to its readers whether Mr. Kim would genuinely consider giving up his nuclear weapons, or what he might demand in return.", "title": "North Korean News Outlets Fawn Over Kim but Offer Few Clues on Nuclear Plan", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "text": "Seoul and Pyongyang have a long history of this. In 1992, there were the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression and Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North and the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. At the historic 2000 summit, there was the South-North Joint Declaration, after which President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea famously declared: \u201cThere is no longer going to be any war. The North will no longer attempt unification by force, and at the same time we will not do any harm to the North.\u201d\n\nAnd in October 2007, there was the so-called \u201cpeace declaration\u201d in the eight-point agreement signed by Kim Jong-il and President Roh Moo-hyun. \u201cThe South and the North both recognize the need to end the current armistice regime and build a permanent peace regime,\u201d it read.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it: All of these deals were then trash-canned. The North Korean promises in them were worthless, indeed deceitful. These agreements only seemed to hold force until, well, they no longer did, when Pyongyang unilaterally decided to ignore, violate or repudiate them.\n\nThis behavior is wholly of a piece with North Korea\u2019s nuclear discussions with the United States, and with its performance in the Six-Party Talks. In its negotiating playbook, situational ethics rule. Accepting foreign constraints on North Korean power is regarded not only as foolish, but also as positively unpatriotic.\n\nAlas, the South Korean government now seems eager to swallow another order of sucker-bait. Ahead of this week\u2019s planned summit, in return for a peace bridge to nowhere, it has already agreed to leave human rights off the table. (President Trump, for his part, gave his \u201cblessing\u201d to these misbegotten talks.)\n\nWhy, given the precedents? Because the Sunshine Policy is something of a secular religion in South Korea \u2014 at least among its adherents, who include main players in the current government \u2014 and, like all faiths, it is immune to empirical falsification. Sunshiners also seem to be convinced that only they can coax the North onto the path of common sense.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not underestimate the political psychopathology of appeasement: People grow weary of the prospect of endless conflict with an implacable enemy and want to believe in solutions even if there are none. (Western Europe suffered a similar condition regarding the Soviet Union in the 1970s and \u201980s.)\n\nThe problem is that North Korea can walk away from its peace promises at any time. And when it eventually does, it will be able to blame whomever it wishes for this tragic result \u2014 potentially polarizing politics in South Korea, igniting tensions in Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington or fracturing the loose coalition of governments that rallied around sanctions against it. In the meantime, Pyongyang will hold the other parties hostage to the fear that if any of its new demands aren\u2019t met, it will quit the peace process.", "title": "Opinion | North Korea\u2019s Phony Peace Ploy", "authors": []}

Read our analysis here.]\n\nThe Trump administration has tightened sanctions on North Korea with China\u2019s help and, mindful that the North has failed to deliver on its promises in the past, insisted that Mr. Kim make substantial progress dismantling his nuclear arsenal before the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign is eased.\n\nBut by agreeing to pursue a peace deal this year, Mr. Moon held out the prospect of progress toward one of North Korea\u2019s top goals before the North has given up its nuclear weapons, and perhaps measures to withdraw troops from inside the Demilitarized Zone, the heavily armed buffer area between the two Koreas, and create a joint fishing zone around the disputed western sea border, a scene of bloody naval skirmishes between the two Koreas.\n\nMr. Moon also dangled an economic incentive, reaffirming promises made in the past by the South of huge investments to help improve the North\u2019s road and train systems. But those agreements collapsed as the North persisted in developing nuclear weapons, and Mr. Moon\u2019s aides have said that such assistance can only come after the North makes progress toward denuclearization and sanctions are lifted.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Washington, Mr. Trump signaled his support of Mr. Moon\u2019s position, writing early Friday on Twitter: \u201cGood things are happening, but only time will tell!\u201d Fifteen minutes later, he declared in an all-caps tweet, \u201cKOREAN WAR TO END!\u201d and said that all Americans should be \u201cvery proud\u201d of what was taking place on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDuring an appearance in the Oval Office with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday, Mr. Trump said he believed that the North Korean leader was serious about making a deal to give up his nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s playing,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who faulted his predecessors for their handling of the threat from North Korea, saying they had allowed themselves to be duped.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be played, O.K.?

The Chinese Foreign Ministry praised the courage of the two Korean leaders, and said it welcomed \u201cthe new journey\u201d for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe tone of the summit meeting \u2014 much of which was broadcast live in South Korea but not North Korea \u2014 was convivial and at times jocular, with Mr. Kim showing surprising honesty about the differences in conditions between the two nations.\n\nYoon Young-chan, Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, said Mr. Kim acknowledged the poor road conditions in his country, a startling admission for a member of his ruling family, which is considered godlike and faultless among North Koreans. Mr. Kim also revealed that the North Koreans who visited the South during the Winter Olympics in February all admired the bullet train there.\n\nAfter Mr. Moon spoke of wanting to visit North Korea, Mr. Kim said, \u201cIt will be very embarrassing,\u201d alluding to roads there.\n\nMr. Kim also repeated a lighthearted line he had used in his meeting with South Korean envoys who visited Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, last month, apologizing to Mr. Moon for disturbing his sleep with missile tests and forcing him to attend meetings of his National Security Council.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI heard you had your early-morning sleep disturbed many times because you had to attend the N.S.C. meetings because of us,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cGetting up early in the morning must have become a habit for you. I will make sure that your morning sleep won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon joked back: \u201cNow I can sleep in peace.\u201d\n\n[The Korean leaders\u2019 meeting was a carefully choreographed dance, with a surprise step.

And they said Mr. Moon would visit Pyongyang in the fall.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Moon, a progressive leader who says he likes to see South Korea \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d in pushing the peace effort forward, is trying to broker a successful summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, which is expected in late May or early June.\n\nMr. Kim rattled the region last year by testing long-range missiles and trading threats of nuclear war with Mr. Trump. But then he abruptly shifted gears, saying he was willing to give up his nuclear weapons for the right incentives and proposing the meeting with Mr. Trump.\n\nLast weekend, Mr. Kim announced an end to all nuclear and long-range-missile tests, saying that his country had mastered how to mount nuclear warheads on missiles and no longer needed to conduct tests. Mr. Kim said North Korea had adopted a \u201cnew strategic line\u201d focusing on economic development.\n\nSkeptics say Mr. Kim is trying to improve ties with South Korea to steer it from the United States and escape sanctions that are increasingly hurting the North\u2019s economy. Indeed, many conservatives in the South fear that the North\u2019s goal remains to be accepted as a nuclear power in return for freezing its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile programs.\n\nThe declaration by Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon \u201cis breathtaking in its scope and ambition,\u201d David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said by email. \u201cBut how to achieve all the goals laid out in the document, given the current situation?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUnless \u201ca firm foundation\u201d for North Korea\u2019s verifiable nuclear disarmament were laid out, he added, most of the other commitments in the agreement were \u201cmerely wishes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnalysts have warned that once negotiations begin with the United States, North Korea could push them into a stalemate by trying to drag Washington into nuclear arms reduction talks.\n\nTo prevent that, South Korea and the United States are trying to persuade North Korea to agree to a specific timeline for complete denuclearization: as soon as possible and no later than the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s current term, in early 2021, according to South Korean officials and analysts.\n\nDuring their morning talks, Mr. Kim pushed for more summit meetings with Mr. Moon, saying he would like to visit the presidential Blue House in Seoul. He said North Korea would cooperate to make a \u201cbetter world.\u201d\n\nBut he also voiced caution, suggesting South Korea and the United States deserved blame for scuttling previous deals.\n\n\u201cAs the expectations are high, so is the skepticism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, we had reached big agreements, but they were not implemented for more than 10 years.

They stood in North Korea, shaking hands for a few seconds, before returning to the South.\n\nMr. Kim found a moment to make light of his country\u2019s missile and nuclear tests, which have caused such deep concern in recent years.\n\n\u201cI heard you had your early-morning sleep disturbed many times because you had to attend the N.S.C. meetings because of us,\u201d Mr. Kim said with a smile, referring to the security council. \u201cGetting up early in the morning must have become a habit for you. I will make sure that your morning sleep won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d \u201cNow I can sleep in peace,\u201d Mr. Moon replied.\n\nIn one conversation, Mr. Kim made reference to several delicate points in relations between the two sides.\n\n\u201cOn my way here I saw that those who had been nervous about any shelling from the North Korean Army \u2014 including the Yeonpyeong Island residents, North Korean defectors and displaced people \u2014 do have high hopes for our meeting today,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s mention of Yeonpyeong Island refers to a 2010 attack from the North that killed two South Korean marines and two civilian construction workers. The \u201cdisplaced people\u201d is a reference to Korean families who were separated during the Korean War.\n\n\u201cI look forward to making the most of this opportunity so that we have the chance to heal the wounds between the North and the South,\u201d Mr. Kim added. \u201cThe demarcation line, which is in fact not high, may disappear with many people stepping on it and passing over it.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon mentioned a recent bus crash in North Korea that killed 32 Chinese tourists and four North Korean workers.", "title": "North and South Korean Leaders\u2019 Own Words in Meeting at the DMZ", "authors": []}

His off-season strength workouts were more straightforward than the hours in the gym players like Syndergaard often spend, and they were carried out among many people older than deGrom at a rehabilitation center in his hometown, DeLand, Fla.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an elastic, tall and lanky person, so he doesn\u2019t need to hit the gym and get so strong,\u201d Syndergaard said.\n\nAnd in terms of a diet, well, deGrom\u2019s teammates might best explain his approach to nutrition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be 260 pounds if I ate what he eats,\u201d said Jay Bruce, the Mets\u2019 right fielder.\n\n\u201cHe can go to McDonald\u2019s,\u201d added Travis d\u2019Arnaud, the Mets\u2019 injured catcher, \u201cget two Big Macs and fries, and stay the same or probably even lose weight.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough most pitchers rest their arms during much of the off-season, deGrom plays catch nearly year-round with his father in his childhood backyard. Teammates joke that deGrom could roll out of bed and pitch, while others need hours to prepare their bodies. The day after starts, deGrom\u2019s arm is sprightly enough to fling a football 50 yards.\n\n\u201cIf I tried to do that, my arm would go flying with the football,\u201d pitcher Zack Wheeler said, adding with a laugh, \u201cHe recovers well and his body treats him right, even though he probably doesn\u2019t treat it right.\u201d\n\nDeGrom does care for his body; he is a professional baseball player, after all, making $7.4 million this season. He just does it a bit differently from many of his teammates. Nonetheless, it has worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the start of 2014, the season in which he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, to the start of this season, deGrom\u2019s 2.98 earned run average ranked ninth \u2014 better than standouts such as Jon Lester of the Chicago Cubs, Stephen Strasburg of the Washington Nationals and Dallas Keuchel of the Houston Astros. He is lauded for his pitching smarts, too, not just throwing hard, and is 2-0 with a 3.06 E.R.A. to start this season.\n\n\u201cJake\u2019s got a routine that is probably different than 99.9 percent of the guys in here,\u201d the Mets\u2019 captain, David Wright, said. \u201cHe gets his work in and prepares, but there are just a few things about him that are offbeat.\u201d\n\nDeGrom was always thin but not tall. As a high school freshman he was 5-foot-2, but he hit a growth spurt at Stetson University, where he was a shortstop with a weak bat. He converted to pitcher before the Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 draft. After struggling to add weight in the past \u2014 pitchers often seek more mass to help throw \u2014 he gave up. For the past several years, deGrom weighed 183 pounds.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Asked if he ate fruits and vegetables, deGrom insisted he did. In the off-season, he said, he and his wife, Stacey, cook steaks or chicken.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut during the season, many of deGrom\u2019s meals come from the clubhouse dining room, and even then he doesn\u2019t always choose the healthiest option.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against eating good foods,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI just like to enjoy some McDonald\u2019s every once in a while.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the off-season, deGrom worked out at CORA Physical Therapy in his hometown, which, he said, is frequented by older adults and where he underwent rehabilitation from Tommy John and ulnar nerve surgeries. Unlike Syndergaard, who has private trainers, deGrom followed whatever workouts Dustin Clarke, the Mets\u2019 strength and conditioning coach, sent him. He compared his body type to that of Chris Sale, the Boston Red Sox\u2019 hard-throwing ace whose fatty diet belies his 6-foot-6, 180-pound frame.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more about leverage, and being long and lanky,\u201d deGrom said, adding, \u201cIf we were in the weight room like Noah, we\u2019d probably be hurt.\u201d\n\nWhat also sets deGrom apart is how much he values running sprints and year-round throwing. He noticed that Max Scherzer and Clayton Kershaw, two multiple winners of the Cy Young Award, ran hard sprints in between starts, so he does the same.\n\nIn this era of conserving the finite life of the pitching arm, deGrom swears by constant throwing. Over the winter, he fired around 40 throws with his father from shorter distances three times a week.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into spring, my arm felt great because I kept it moving,\u201d he said. Any other approach feels illogical to him. \u201cYou work out and build this muscle, but it\u2019s not used to throwing? You throw that much throughout the year and then you want to stop for two months?\u201d\n\nDeGrom\u2019s approach has worked in the sense that he was the only Mets starter to stay healthy in 2017 and he finished with his first 200-inning campaign. Between starts during the season, he threw two abbreviated bullpen sessions, instead of one longer one, to keep his mechanics sharp. In future off-seasons, deGrom said, he might not rest his arm at all.\n\nThere is now also yet another key difference with Syndergaard.\n\nOver the winter, deGrom chopped off his trademark long locks. Fans may have thought he cared a lot about his hair, but when he decided to get rid of it, he asked Wright to trim it in the clubhouse bathroom. Just like that, it was gone. Teammates were not surprised.\n\n\u201cIt used to be legs, limbs and hair coming at you, but now it\u2019s legs and limbs,\u201d d\u2019Arnaud said.", "title": "Not Necessarily Thor: One Mets Ace Is Not Like the Other", "authors": ["James Wagner"]}

{"date": "2018-04-20 00:00:00", "text": "This week\u2019s issue features an essay adapted from Jesmyn Ward\u2019s introduction to a new edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d In 1925, Edwin Clark reviewed the novel for the Book Review. Below is an excerpt.\n\nOf the many new writers that sprang into notice with the advent of the post-war period, Scott Fitzgerald has remained the steadiest performer and the most entertaining. Now he has said farewell to his flappers and is writing of the older sisters that have married. To use a phrase of Burton Rascoe\u2019s \u2014 his hurt romantics are still seeking that other side of paradise. And it might almost be said that \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d is the last stage of illusion in this absurd chase.\n\nThe story of Jay Gatsby of West Egg is told by Nick Carraway, who is one of the legion from the Middle West who have moved on to New York and finds in Long Island a fascinating but dangerous playground. Gatsby\u2019s fortune, business, even his connection with underworld figures, remain vague generalizations. Of his uncompromising love \u2014 his love for Daisy Buchanan \u2014 his effort to recapture the past romance \u2014 we are explicitly informed. This patient romantic hopefulness against existing conditions symbolizes Gatsby.\n\nNick Carraway had known Tom Buchanan at New Haven. Daisy, his wife, was a distant cousin. The post-war reactions were at their height \u2014 everyone was restless. Buchanan had acquired another woman. Daisy was bored, broken in spirit and neglected. Gatsby, his parties and his mysterious wealth were the gossip of the hour. At the Buchanans Nick met Jordan Baker; through them both Daisy again meets Gatsby, to whom she had been engaged before she married Buchanan. The inevitable consequence that follows is almost incidental, for in the overtones the decay of souls is more tragic. With keen psychological observation, Fitzgerald discloses in these people a meanness of spirit and absence of loyalties. He cannot hate them, for they are dumb in their selfishness, and only to be pitied. A curious book, a mystical, glamourous story of today.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

Five years ago, Liesl Schillinger reviewed \u201cThe Interestings\u201d and considered Wolitzer\u2019s place in American fiction. Below is an excerpt.\n\nH. L. Mencken once wrote that his definition of happiness included \u201ca comfortable feeling of superiority to the masses of one\u2019s fellow men.\u201d And yet his quest to be exceptional didn\u2019t appear to make him all that happy. But does the compulsion to excel make anybody happy?\n\nThat\u2019s the question that preoccupies Jules Jacobson, the ambitious protagonist of Meg Wolitzer\u2019s remarkable novel, \u201cThe Interestings,\u201d whose inclusive vision and generous sweep place it among the ranks of books like Jonathan Franzen\u2019s \u201cFreedom\u201d and Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s \u201cMarriage Plot.\u201d \u201cThe Interestings\u201d is warm, all-American and acutely perceptive about the feelings and motivations of its characters, male and female, young and old, gay and straight; but it\u2019s also stealthily and undeniably a novel of ideas. Wolitzer has been writing excellent fiction for 30 years, and it has always been this astute. From the start, her subject has been the practical, emotional and sexual fallout of women\u2019s liberation, particularly as it affects mothers and children. But here she has written a novel that speaks as directly to men as to women.\n\nIn \u201cThe Interestings,\u201d Jules Jacobson poses a broad question, asking herself what the boys (now men) and girls (now women) she has lionized since her teens, and emulated throughout her adult life, have lost through their persistent, rarely rewarded efforts to opt in. She wonders if all of them have inaccurately defined success, believing they would only matter if they were extraordinary.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

In a 1966 review of Coover\u2019s first novel, \u201cThe Origin of the Brunists,\u201d Webster Schott praised the young author\u2019s talent and forecast his success.\n\nRobert Coover writes his first novel as if he doesn\u2019t expect to make it to a second. Everything goes into it, including plots for several grim short stories and more social novels, and notes for a juicy essay on how West Condon ministers and their wives celebrate the Feast of the Resurrection. It begins as an account of the founding of a crackpot religious sect named for an Italian-American coal miner who miraculously survives a mine disaster that kills 98 others. En route to the final formalization of the Brunists \u2014 election of bishops and cutting up the territory \u2014 Mr. Coover takes apart the economy, power structure, social order and sexual codes of a small town berserk with holiness. Burning with ambition, \u201cThe Origin of the Brunists\u201d achieves much that this young teacher at Bard College hopes for. It is a novel of intensity and conviction \u2014 even though he forgets which of his many stories he most wants to tell and cries uncle in the clutch. If he can somehow control his Hollywood giganticism and focus his vision of life, he may become heir to Dreiser or Lewis.\n\nThe strength of this novel derives from the old tradition. It brings us the news about mining, petty journalism, small-town nonculture and the weird fusion of truth and wish that sometimes underpins religious belief. It\u2019s impregnated with stories. It creates characters. But it offers no new or terrifying revelations. The reason: Mr. Coover himself is unable to decide whether the Brunists are tragic or comic figures, whether West Condon is a joke or a condition.\n\nIt\u2019s a pity Mr. Coover ran out of ideas before words. He has a splendid talent. There\u2019s no joy in seeing it too lie spent.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

In a 1998 review of \u201cGain,\u201d Bruce Bawer marveled at Powers\u2019s prescient commentary on American life. Read an excerpt below:\n\n\u201cThree Farmers on Their Way to a Dance,\u201d which appeared when Powers had not yet turned 30, was nothing less than enthralling in its ambition and promise. Since then he has continued to explore some of the darker ironies, absurdities and tragedies of life in the American century. Dense, challenging, aphoristic and swarming with recondite allusions and puns, these novels display an authoritative grasp of a breathtaking range of subjects. But while Powers never seems out to impress or obfuscate, his conspicuous intelligence and virtuosity have also won him a reputation as difficult, even inaccessible.\n\nHis sixth novel, \u201cGain,\u201d seems designed to change all that. Like his earlier books, it is erudite, penetrating and splendidly written; alongside them, though, it seems positively straightforward. Powers cuts back and forth between two narratives. One relates the history of a small family soap-and-candle business, Jephthah Clare & Sons of Boston, which over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries grows into a giant worldwide conglomerate. The other story, set in the present day, concerns Laura Bodey, a divorced 42-year-old real estate saleswoman.\n\nNeither of the novel\u2019s parallel narratives contains so much as a single surprising plot development. Yet the book holds one\u2019s interest anyway, mainly because Powers makes a compelling tale out of the evolution of American business practices over nearly two centuries. Powers\u2019s account of how Clare\u2019s management acquires a concept of the corporate image and then consciously strives to establish the corporation as \u201ca person\u201d not only \u201cin the eyes of the law\u201d but \u201cin the minds of its customers\u201d is perceptive and valuable.\n\nPowers so powerfully communicates his sense of the corporate world\u2019s tyranny over the 20th-century American soul that one may almost forget the century\u2019s far more monstrous tyrannies \u2014 which were, of course, vanquished through the efforts and example of the capitalist democracies. Yet if one may reasonably dispute the novel\u2019s implicit politics, there is no gainsaying the remarkable artistry and authority with which Powers, in this dazzling book, continues to impart his singular vision of our life and times.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}
