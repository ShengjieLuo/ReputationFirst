It was built by Horne Brothers Construction, which at the project\u2019s peak hired about 50 people to drive piles and install the solar panels.\n\nAnd then there are the Vinsons, the farming family who now have a steady income from leasing their land that allowed Tommy\u2019s mother, Martha, to comfortably retire.\n\nOn a brisk day this month, the Vinsons sidestepped puddles of melting snow as they walked through rows of solar panels. But the sun was still shining, and the air above the panels shimmered with heat. Built on a 30-acre site, the project now produces enough power for 1,000 homes \u2014 including, potentially, that of the Vinsons, who live just a mile away.\n\nIn North Carolina, state laws and tax incentives that favor solar projects selling power directly to the electrical grid have helped the industry expand to the point where it now powers more than 400,000 homes and employs around 7,000 people.\n\nSolar\u2019s Expansion Is Tied to Its Plummeting Cost How the so-called levelized cost of energy \u2013 the average price per megawatt hour that projects need to charge to break even over their lifetime \u2013 has changed for nuclear, coal, gas, solar and wind. $150 100 50 0 Nuclear Coal Gas Wind Solar 2010 2012 2014 2016 $150 100 50 0 Nuclear Coal Gas Wind Solar 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n\n\u201cEverything you see here, with the exception of the module, was built in America,\u201d said Tom Kosto, the executive vice president of Horne Brothers Construction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kosto\u2019s company has expanded in the last three years to 350 full-time employees, from just 30, and he said he planned to hire 100 more people this year. He pays his employees an average of $17.31, with benefits. But he said the tariffs would force his company to cut back on its expansion plans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a profitable company, but with one stroke of the pen, they can take that away,\u201d Mr. Kosto said. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re putting thousands of jobs at risk for jobs that aren\u2019t coming back.\u201d\n\nThe move is expected to hit utility-scale solar projects like this one, which sell their electricity to power companies, particularly hard. Home and business owners may decide to continue buying solar panels for their rooftops, even if the price is a little higher. But when solar projects sell to a utility company, they compete with other sources of energy, and every cent counts.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

As a result, the number of solar installations has soared to 12 gigawatts last year, from less than one gigawatt in 2010.\n\nWhile the tariffs are likely to slow the adoption of solar power in the United States, they will not entirely halt the industry. An analysis by GTM Research found that solar installations will continue to rise from 2018 to 2022, though there will be 11 percent fewer panels installed as a result of the tariffs.\n\nOne reason for the muted effect: Solar cells and modules account for one-third or less of the overall cost of solar systems, and the industry has been relentlessly cutting the costs of all components. All told, the tariffs will increase the cost of utility-scale solar projects by about 10 percent and residential rooftop systems by just 3 percent \u2014 raising them roughly to prices seen two years ago.\n\nBut even a small price increase could slow the industry\u2019s growth in states where solar already faces fierce competition from cheap natural gas, such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or Texas. \u201cIn the Southeast in particular, we were just starting to see solar compete at the margins with natural gas,\u201d said MJ Shiao, a solar analyst at GTM Research.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Solar Tariffs Are Clouding the Industry\u2019s Future", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Brad Plumer"]}

We cannot let these actions to continue to go unpunished.\u201d\n\nThe new law made Monday an important date for action. The law required Mr. Trump to begin imposing sanctions on large purchasers of Russian military equipment. But the State Department said it did not need to do so at this point because it had been using the threat of the law in recent months to press customers to cancel potential deals that would have been worth billions of dollars to Russia.\n\nThe law also directed Mr. Trump to produce a list of \u201csenior political figures and oligarchs\u201d in Russia. No actions were required against those on the list, but it was meant to signal those close to Mr. Putin that they had much to lose if Moscow does not pull back from its intervention in Ukraine and its interference in Western elections, and the prospect of being included alarmed many in Russia.\n\nGrilled by Democrats during a congressional hearing, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rejected suggestions that the administration was delaying action on Russia and said that additional action would be taken. \u201cThere will be sanctions out of this report,\u201d he said.\n\nBut when Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed him on whether he agreed that Mr. Putin \u201chas acted like a thug,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\n\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m not going to use that terminology,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cbut there are clearly issues that we need to address and that we have done with sanctions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go through the list,\u201d Mr. Kennedy replied. \u201cUkraine, Crimea, Syria, he meddled in our election, he\u2019s helping North Korea cheat.

He\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\n\nThe announcements came just days after two senior Russian intelligence officials traveled to Washington to meet with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director. Sergey Y. Naryshkin, director of the foreign intelligence service, was in Washington last week for consultations on terrorism, according to Russian state media, even though he was sanctioned by the American government under President Barack Obama.\n\nAccording to an American official, he was accompanied by Alexander V. Bortnikov, director of the domestic intelligence service, who has not been sanctioned. The C.I.A. would not confirm the meeting but said any interactions would have been in accordance with American law.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The document said that inclusion on the list did not mean involvement in \u201cmalign activities.\u201d\n\nDmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, called it an \u201cenemies list\u201d that could unfairly tar those on it. \u201cThe fact that this list was made public can potentially do damage to the image and reputation of our enterprises, businessmen, politicians and officials,\u201d he told reporters, calling the roster \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u201cDe facto everyone is called the enemy of the United States,\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cIf you read the text and the title of this document, all this is done in accordance with the law on countering the enemies of the United States.\u201d\n\nGovernment figures on the list include more than 40 of Mr. Putin\u2019s closest advisers; all 30 members of the cabinet of ministers, including Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev; and the heads of many important state agencies and state-run companies. At least 22 listed people had already been sanctioned by the Obama administration.\n\nThe list was met with a combination of disbelief and derision in Russia, as mocking comments ricocheted around social media. Some joked that it had taken the Trump administration six months to photocopy the Forbes list of Russian billionaires, since they were all included, as well as the link detailing senior officials on the Kremlin website. Treasury officials confirmed that they did rely on Forbes, among other publicly available sources.\n\n\u201cThe list looks like the book \u2018Who\u2019s Who in Russian Politics,\u2019\u201d Arkady V. Dvorkovich, a deputy prime minister included on the list, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.

One man on the list, Kirill Shamalov, who married one of Mr. Putin\u2019s daughters, might no longer be in the billionaire\u2019s club since they have recently split, Bloomberg reported.\n\nKaspersky Labs issued a statement objecting to its founder\u2019s inclusion, saying the company did not have political influence, and Mr. Kaspersky commented on his own Twitter account, emphasizing that the company helps protect customers \u201cregardless of their origin.\u201d\n\nThe businessman Gavril Yushvaev, who said he had invested $500 million in Western start-ups, told the online news website The Bell that his overseas partners had been calling to say that they would ignore the list. \u201cEverybody needs people who can invest, regardless of these lists,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not upset.

Daniel S. Hamilton, a former State Department official who directs the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University, says that Mr. Trump \u201cuses these tweets and social media to secure his political base,\u201d and \u201cwhether the tweets turn into a policy or not is a whole different question.\u201d\n\nOne cannot ignore presidential tweets, Mr. Hamilton said, \u201cbut their purpose is not to make daily policy pronouncements.\u201d Mr. Trump is well aware of their impact and timing, and when he tweets so early in the morning, Mr. Hamilton said, \u201cit sets up the media for the whole day.\u201d\n\nFor those around Mr. Trump in Washington, the daily battle is to \u201ctry to temper his temperament,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cBut for the allies it\u2019s very hard to read.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut when Mr. Trump\u2019s threats are not followed through \u2014 or are tempered by White House staff, Congress or the courts \u2014 that undermines American credibility, too.\n\nWhile allies do not necessarily take his Twitter posts as policy pronouncements, they still create significant confusion, said Pierre Vimont, former French ambassador to Washington and former top aide to the European Union foreign policy chief.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven in areas where allies agree \u2014 for example, on the threat posed by North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong-un \u2014 \u201cwe have a hard time understanding the real policy line from Washington,\u201d Mr. Vimont said.\n\nThere are clear differences with European allies on climate change, multilateral trade and Jerusalem, he said, \u201cbut even on Ukraine and Syria, where we could agree, we have difficulty understanding where U.S. leadership is, what they are really looking for.\u201d\n\nOn Iran, for example, many Europeans agree with those protesting against the Islamic government, but believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s full-throated support for them on Twitter helps the hard-liners and hurts the moderates.\n\nThe Europeans are united in trying to keep a dialogue going with Iran and to preserve the nuclear accord, which many say should be improved but kept separate from other issues.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France criticized the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia last week for encouraging the antigovernment protests, saying the stance \u201cis almost one that would lead us to war.\u201d Mr. Macron said France wanted to avoid \u201csurreptitiously rebuilding an \u2018axis of evil,\u2019\u201d a reference to the countries singled out by former President George W. Bush \u2014 Iran, North Korea and Iraq.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s tweets do shape how others react,\u201d said Leslie Vinjamuri of SOAS, University of London. \u201cIf they were once aimed at his base, they now seem a way for Trump to shout back at the world, and he keeps circling back to the same issues. In some ways, he\u2019s predictable, emotional and erratic, but he\u2019s not consistent.\u201d\n\nBut no one can ignore the president of the United States, Ms. Vinjamuri said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. still matters, and people are a bit afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hedging going on, countries abstaining but not voting against him. But that\u2019s not enough for Trump. This is a man who wants loyalty.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Twitter Threats Put American Credibility on the Line", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"]}

USA! USA!\u201d Trump\u2019s America is, in the end, a reflection of himself: male, militaristic, white, mean and macho.\n\nHe made a gesture here and there \u2014 backing paid family leave and saying he would let immigrants brought to the United States as children stay and become citizens over a 12-year period \u2014 but his core message was nationalistic, nativist, harsh and defiant.\n\nThis was \u201cVolk und Vaterland\u201d in American guise, stamped with his speechwriter\u2019s clunky and clich\u00e9-ridden prose: \u201cIf there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\u201d\n\nAnd if there\u2019s a border, we build a wall. And if there\u2019s a chance to display bigotry, we seize it.\n\nRussia was the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Trump barely mentioned it, even as the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election gathers pace.

Federal workers deemed to be disloyal were to be summarily fired. Gun control, of course, was a non-subject. This is the America that Trump imagines he is making great again.\n\nAs for immigrants, the president had not a kind word. You would not guess from Trump\u2019s words that a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015 found that the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion. Nor that of the companies that made the Fortune 500 list in 2017, 43 percent were founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant, according to research from the Center for American Entrepreneurship.\n\nTrump is not interested in hope, any more than he is interested in facts.

His first anniversary in the White House on Saturday coincides with a possible federal funding hiatus. Slashing corporate taxes was a Republican success. But the wrangling over a government shutdown is indicative of the partisan deadlock to come.\n\nMembers of Congress sparred on Friday over proposals to authorize stopgap funding until mid-February \u2014 the fourth such temporary measure since October, if it happens. Among other things, the negotiations have been caught up in a battle over immigration. Democrats are seeking to protect from deportation an estimated 700,000 individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The Trump administration said in September that existing protections will expire in March without congressional action.\n\nAt least some Democrats see funding measures \u2014 which Republicans can\u2019t pass in the Senate without support from some of them \u2014 as one of their few areas of leverage. Yet a prolonged shutdown is an expensive way to make a point. The Office of Management and Budget, citing independent forecasters, estimated that the 16-day gap in 2013 knocked 0.2 to 0.6 percent off that year\u2019s fourth-quarter gross domestic product.\n\nEven if lawmakers arrive at a deal, the wrangling is a preview of future rancor. Congress will quiet down later this year as members turn their attention to the fall midterm elections, which might prove bruising for Republicans. The sitting president\u2019s party has suffered in 16 of the 18 postwar midterm elections, with an average loss of about 26 seats in the House. If Democrats manage to flip the lower chamber or even the Senate, they could essentially rule out major legislation, as Republicans did during most of Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nIt all suggests that the tax bill, passed last month, might come to be Mr. Trump\u2019s equivalent of his predecessor\u2019s health care overhaul. The Affordable Care Act became law 14 months after Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration, but the roadblocks to ambitious action hardened from then on. While the Trump administration wants to push an infrastructure-spending package, congressional leaders have more or less abandoned hopes for major changes to welfare programs and other items on their wish list.

It\u2019s hard to imagine an audience less receptive to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Yet, whether he is seeking reconciliation or pitching for strongman status, his mere presence is a rebuke to the elites who got him badly wrong.\n\nMr. Trump will stand out among the 3,000-odd political leaders, financiers and company executives due to convene in the Swiss resort on Jan. 23. His threats to raise barriers to the movement of goods and people, his rejection of the Paris climate change accord and his belligerence toward North Korea have convinced the gathering\u2019s wealthy and mostly liberal delegates that the United States is giving up on global leadership. Indeed, this year\u2019s Davos theme \u2014 \u201cCreating a shared future in a fractured world\u201d \u2014 seems an attempt to mitigate Mr. Trump\u2019s influence.\n\nThe self-proclaimed billionaire will be the first sitting United States president to attend the gathering since Bill Clinton in 2000. Just as President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s right-wing credentials made it possible for him to visit Communist China, Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-globalization stance has enabled him to risk a trip to the European mountain resort. Imagine the vitriol that Barack Obama would have endured at home if he had put in an appearance.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump hopes to achieve is less clear. There will be optimism that his visit is a sign that White House moderates have gained the upper hand. Even so, it is hard to imagine Mr. Trump giving a conciliatory speech or defending globalization, as the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, did last year.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely that he will be party pooper in chief, reasserting his isolationist policies while reminding the crowd of what it failed to foresee. At Davos two years ago, delegates dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning the presidential election. A year later, attendees talked up his pragmatic deal-making credentials \u2014 only to watch Mr. Trump\u2019s dark and foreboding inaugural address.\n\nThe Davos crowd does not object to autocrats: Mr. Xi and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have received applause in previous years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, another nationalist, will deliver this year\u2019s keynote speech. Ultimately, Mr. Trump will not be that different to the other wealthy attendees on the ski slopes, debating what the masses really think.", "title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 Agenda Is Crashing Davos Party", "authors": ["Una Galani"]}

ALEXIS SOLOSKI\n\nDark Ride (1981)\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the first plays that pushed Soho Rep beyond dramatic classics, this eccentric Len Jenkin drama had a story, impossible to parse, which somehow involved occultists, oculists and a stolen diamond.

One potential candidate is in prison. Another was kept under effective house arrest until he withdrew. A third is on trial and will be disqualified if his conviction is upheld.

According to PropertyShark, between Jan. 1 and Dec. 6, 2017, the median sales price of homes was $893,700, a year-on-year decrease of 10 percent based on 396 transactions. Of 54 neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, the site ranked Turtle Bay 39th in median sales price. The most expensive was TriBeCa, at $4,683,950 million; the least expensive, Bedford-Stuyvesant, at $799,000.\n\nAs of Jan. 8, the real estate site StreetEasy calculated the median rent of a one-bedroom apartment in Turtle Bay at $3,200, based on 113 available listings and a map that extends the southern border to 42nd Street.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

They ranged from a one-bedroom co-op on East 51st Street, priced at $315,500, to a four-bedroom duplex penthouse condo with a private swimming pool at 50 United Nations Plaza, priced at $56 million (a bargain compared to its original asking price of $70 million).\n\nThe Vibe\n\nTurtle Bay is an enclave with its own surprising pockets. Beekman Place, a two-block stub between 49th and 50th Streets east of First Avenue, where Irving Berlin lived for more than 40 years (his home was sold to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), has the scrubbed, hushed perfection of a movie set. Peter Detmold Park, a patch at 454 East 51st Street with a dog run, includes a bridge that juts over the F.D.R. and connects to a paved slice of riverside. Amster Yard is a courtyard and sculpture garden at 211 East 49th Street with original and reconstructed 19th-century buildings at the entrance of Instituto Cervantes. And Greenacre Park is a refuge at 217 East 51st Street with honey locust trees and a 25-foot waterfall.\n\nThe Schools\n\nTurtle Bay has no public schools; residents are zoned for elementary and middle schools near its borders and, like all New Yorkers, attend high school throughout the five boroughs.\n\nP.S. 59, Beekman Hill International, at 233 East 56th Street, serves about 620 students in first through fifth grades. On 2016-17 state tests, 77 percent met standards in English versus 40 percent statewide; 80 percent met standards in math versus 45 percent statewide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJ.H.S. 104, Simon Baruch Junior High School, at 330 East 21st Street, serves more than 1,100 students in sixth through eighth grades. On state tests, 67 percent met standards in English versus 41 percent statewide; 68 percent met standards in math versus 33 percent statewide.\n\nA nearby secondary school, the High School of Art and Design, at 245 East 56th Street, enrolls about 1,500 students in ninth through 12th grades. The average 2015-16 SAT scores, the last for which data was available, were 479 for critical reading and 464 for mathematics, compared with 494 and 508 statewide.\n\nThe Commute\n\nGrand Central Terminal, at 42nd Street and Park Avenue, provides access to the 4, 5, 6, 7 and S trains, as well as Metro-North Railroad. The 4, 6, E and M trains stop at the Lexington Avenue/51st Street M.T.A. station. Buses are available on the M15, M42, M50, M101, M102 and M103 lines.\n\nThe History\n\nNamed for a cove that was later filled in, Turtle Bay has a history that is as disjointed as an exquisite corpse. (Whether the name was a homage to actual reptiles is dubious; it is more likely a corruption of the Dutch word \u201cdeutal,\u201d or bent blade, referring to the inlet\u2019s shape.)

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThere are still many drinkers who have yet to experience the hazy, citrusy brew,\u201d said Meaghan Quinn, a spokeswoman for Samuel Adams.\n\nThe fervor around these beers is ripe with hyperbole, but in the best examples, it\u2019s warranted. Hazy I.P.A.s offer lush, juicy flavors that beers have never had before. Brewers are harnessing the citrus and tropical notes of new hop varieties while eschewing their characteristic bitterness, a trick they achieve by loading their hops late in the brewing process, and in huge quantities.\n\nThese beers seem to defy large-scale production and cross-country shipping; many brewers intentionally keep batches small to ensure freshness through high turnover. But Sierra Nevada in particular has consistently made world-class beers in big volume, and these ephemeral I.P.A.s will be its biggest test.\n\nThe beers\u2019 haze has traditionally come from hop particles that mix with yeast in suspension. The result is hop flavors that, rather than wafting up to your nose from the glass, burst in your mouth after each sip.\n\nAs the New England style has proliferated, breweries have turned to high-protein grains, like oats and unmalted wheat, to build a more stable haze for their beloved hops to nest in. Others use additives like pectin or even flour, igniting debate in the most fervent corners of the craft-beer world.\n\nSierra Nevada uses oats in its recipe for Hazy Little Thing. But it also employs other tricks for quality control, including one common among wheat beer producers: When sending kegs to restaurants and bars, the company instructs distributors to ship them upside down. That way, the bartender is forced to flip them upon delivery, stirring up the proteins and restoring the haze.\n\nToday, an I.P.A.\u2019s cloudy appearance has become its signifier, even a status symbol, flooding Instagram feeds and inspiring hashtags like #hazyipa and #newenglendipa. Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery, has declared the New England ales \u201cthe first beer style based around Instagram culture and based around social media.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in the beginning, haze wasn\u2019t the goal; it was a side effect. \u201cWe never set out to brew an I.P.A. that was hazy,\u201d said John Kimmich, a founder and the head brewer of the Alchemist in Waterbury, Vt. \u201cOur I.P.A. was hazy because we brewed it the way I wanted it to taste.\u201d\n\nMr. Kimmich is the creator of Heady Topper, the ale that popularized the style and still sells out hours after a shipment hits New York City. His beer brims with flavors of tropical fruit and pine, balanced with a keen, citrus-peel bitterness. When he began brewing Heady Topper in 2004, his goal was to load up on hop flavors using \u201cdry hopping,\u201d or adding hops during fermentation rather than during the boiling process. This coaxes more aroma than bitter flavor from the hops; the sheer volume of hops happened to turn the beer hazy.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike many brewers of this style, Mr. Kimmich is intent on keeping his operation and availability regional. In true Vermont fashion, it doesn\u2019t take much to get him started about corporate greed and his allegiance to helping the local community.\n\nSome might question the need to sell a beer this perishable nationwide. Fresh, locally made beer is readily available these days in most metropolitan areas.\n\nBut the hazy-I.P.A. trend hasn\u2019t swept the middle of the nation yet, and Samuel Adams hopes to bring some people their first taste of the style. The company is keeping an eye on distributors to ensure that consumers get their beer fresh.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the company is banking on the beer\u2019s staying good for a while; it is setting an expiration date of three months for its New England I.P.A.\n\nMr. Kimmich is most excited about the new beer from Sierra Nevada, a company he idolized early in his career, as a brewer in the 1990s at the Vermont Pub and Brewery.\n\n\u201cSierra Nevada? Those guys,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many countless beers have they inspired with their pale ale?\u201d\n\nHow the New Brews Taste\n\nNew England-style I.P.A.s walk a spectrum from bitter to sweet. This is a case where balance isn\u2019t always preferred: If you already love I.P.A.s, there are many bitter ones to satisfy you. If you don\u2019t, the sweet variety could be your gateway drink.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow that two of the nation\u2019s largest craft brewers have entered the scene, with Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing (6.7 percent alcohol by volume) and Samuel Adams New England I.P.A. (6.8 percent A.B.V.), how do they fit into that spectrum?\n\nIn terms of flavor, both are a tier below their small-batch counterparts, missing the vibrant fruitiness that distinguishes the best of breed. Samuel Adams\u2019s beer evokes citrus but not in the literal, tastes-like-juice way that is the New England style; it\u2019s scarcely different from an ordinary I.P.A.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada beer has more pleasant flavors of dried apricot and dried pineapple, and is the better choice if you can\u2019t find something fresh and local.\n\nBut in many parts of the country, local examples will be more expressive and worth seeking out. In New York, Other Half Brewing is the king of hazy I.P.A.s, so much so that its cans are nearly impossible to find. But they are worth the hunt \u2014 lean, racy and sharp with hops.\n\nGreenpoint Beer & Ale\u2019s Instant Credibility (7.8 percent A.B.V.) punches with aggressive bitterness and an undercurrent of pulpy orange and mango nectar. Also lovely is its spiritual opposite from upstate, Industrial Arts Wrench (6.8 percent A.B.V.), which embodies the sweet end of the spectrum with a silky mouth feel and flavors that verge on pineapple juice. I.P.A. skeptics, start here.\n\nAs the originator of the New England style, the Alchemist\u2019s Heady Topper (8 percent A.B.V.) has one foot in the traditional I.P.A. style, with familiar notes of pine, grapefruit and resin turned up in the foreground, washing over a background of fruit-driven hops.\n\nMr. Kimmich, Alchemist\u2019s brewer, calls it \u201cbalanced,\u201d and hopheads will attest to that. It won\u2019t bring new fans to hoppy beers, but it\u2019s a treat for the already converted.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

He added, \u201cWhile most decisions taken by even a Fed chairman are in the end not make-or-break, most Fed chairs face at least one profoundly consequential decision during their tenure.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has discussed some vice-chairman candidates who could fit the bill, including Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Fed governor and director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, and Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, who is widely respected as both an investor and a commentator on monetary policy, according to a person who has participated in some of those conversations.\n\nThe White House has not said when it plans to announce a decision.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s board of directors, which is at an earlier stage in its search, has said that it was focused on finding a technocrat who understood the bank\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut technocrats come in many flavors, and there are signs that the New York Fed would like someone in the mold of Mr. Dudley or Ms. Yellen, both of whom have emphasized the effects of monetary policy on ordinary people.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Scott is executive vice president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a nonprofit that backs community development projects.\n\nThe leaders of the search committee are Sara Horowitz, the executive director of a New York labor union, and Glenn Hutchins, a private equity executive who has long been a major donor to Democratic political candidates. The fourth member is David M. Cote, chairman of Honeywell International.\n\nThe committee has hired two search firms, one of which specializes in identifying a diverse field of candidates. It also made a point of meeting with a group of liberal activists, including labor unions and community development groups, in addition to the standard roster of banks and business officials.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe divergent selection processes are an artifact of the Fed\u2019s structure: A board of political appointees in Washington oversees the operations of 12 regional reserve banks, which are privately owned by the commercial banks in each region. The New York Fed is owned by major banks including Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase as well as smaller community banks.\n\nAlthough the regional reserve banks have lost much of their original autonomy, they retain the power to select their own presidents, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.\n\nMonetary policy is made by a committee comprising the Fed\u2019s governors and five of the regional presidents. The president of the New York Fed holds one of those votes on a permanent basis, a reflection of New York\u2019s longstanding role as the nation\u2019s financial center, and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The remaining four votes rotate among the other 11 regional banks.\n\nWhile private ownership of central banks was once quite common, most developed nations have converted to fully public systems, and the list of holdouts is dwindling. Austria took ownership of all shares in the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 2010. South Africa said in December that it would move to take full ownership of the South African Reserve Bank.\n\nAndrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist and a former Fed official, said it\u2019s past time to make the Fed a fully public institution, too. Mr. Levin has proposed that the federal government should take ownership of the regional reserve banks, and that the selection of regional reserve presidents should be a public process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important public officials in the United States and that person is being chosen by a private board of directors of a private institution,\u201d he said, referring to the New York Fed\u2019s current search.\n\nBut some liberal activists who, under the Obama Administration, pushed for the government to take control of the reserve banks now see the New York Fed\u2019s independence from Washington as potentially valuable.\n\nShawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, a consortium of groups that lobbies the Fed to prioritize employment and wage growth when making monetary policy, said his organization is pushing for the New York Fed to make a statement with its decision.\n\n\u201cThe next president needs to have a real and demonstrated commitment to full employment, by having worked for the public interest and low-income people in their career,\u201d he said.", "title": "Two Federal Reserve Openings Provide One Chance to Counter Trump", "authors": ["Binyamin Appelbaum"]}

{"date": "2018-01-13 00:00:00", "text": "Over the past few years, the discussion of crime and violence in the United States has focused on police brutality, mass incarceration and the sharp rise in violence in cities like Baltimore, St. Louis and Chicago. This is entirely appropriate: Any spike in violence should garner attention, and redressing the injustices of our criminal justice system is a matter of moral urgency.\n\nBut it is also worth reflecting on how much the level of violence has fallen in this country over the past 25 years and how widespread the benefits of that decline have been. From the 1970s through the early part of the 1990s, the murder rate in some cities in the United States rose to levels seen only in the most violent, war-torn nations of the developing world. In the years since, violent crime has decreased in almost every city, in many cases by more than 75 percent.\n\nFor well-off urbanites, the decline of crime is most visible in sanitized, closely guarded city spaces where tourists and others can now comfortably wander about. But far more consequential have been the changes in low-income, highly segregated urban communities. Indeed, my research has shown that the most disadvantaged people have gained the most from the reduction in violent crime.\n\nStart with the lives saved. Though homicide is not a common cause of death for most of the United States population, for African-American men between the ages of 15 and 34 it is the leading cause, which means that any change in the homicide rate has a disproportionate impact on them. The sociologist Michael Friedson and I calculated what the life expectancy would be today for blacks and whites had the homicide rate never shifted from its level in 1991. We found that the national decline in the homicide rate since then has increased the life expectancy of black men by roughly nine months.", "title": "Opinion | Two Lessons of the Urban Crime Decline", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "As proof of the happy results when a director and a literary titan align, along comes Ian Rickson\u2019s 60th-anniversary production of \u201cThe Birthday Party\u201d from a writer, Harold Pinter, who relished language just as much as Wilde, but with very different results. The play is running at the Harold Pinter Theater \u2014 how apt! \u2014 through April 14.\n\nNot that Pinter\u2019s disorienting amalgam of mirth and menace was particularly welcomed at its 1958 premiere; the play was greeted with general befuddlement until a celebrated review from Harold Hobson in The Sunday Times of London alerted readers to the playwright\u2019s singular capacity to disturb and provoke. No matter: The production nonetheless closed after a week.\n\nIts current iteration by contrast looks likely to be London\u2019s first theatrical hit of 2018 \u2014 a testament to a starry cast that anchors the piece in a recognizable time and place while allowing its absurdism to shine through. (You can tick off the various textual nods to \u201cWaiting for Godot,\u201d which was first seen in London only several years before \u201cThe Birthday Party.\u201d)\n\nThe setting is one of those rundown seaside boardinghouses that Pinter would have known firsthand when he used to tour the regions as an actor under the stage name David Baron. You can practically smell the damp rising from behind the cracked wallpaper of the living room set.\n\nThe evocatively dreary environs belong to Meg (Zo\u00eb Wanamaker) and her husband Petey (Peter Wight), though questions of ownership and control soon come to define the play. The couple have a lodger, Stanley (Toby Jones), who seems to be a surrogate for the son Meg never had. Stanley is a study in unspecified damage, and an unspoken anger courses beneath his blandly bespectacled visage. It\u2019s not altogether surprising when he reaches toward Meg in what looks like an embrace, only to put his hands around her throat.\n\nPhoto\n\nPetey, a deckchair attendant, keeps absenting himself, allowing Meg and Stanley to pursue their warped interactions unbothered, until into this peculiar trio comes the troubling double-act of Goldberg (Stephen Mangan) and McCann (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor). They have arrived to deliver Stanley to an unseen character called Monty, though who Monty is or what he represents is anyone\u2019s (fearsome) guess.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom this self-enclosed landscape \u2014 we never leave the living room \u2014 Pinter maps out themes of dominance and usurpation that he would revisit throughout a lifetime of plays that shifted over the years from the domestic to the more overtly political. His gift for ambiguity, too, is everywhere evident: Meg refers more than once to a boardinghouse that is \u201con the list,\u201d by which she presumably doesn\u2019t mean the tourist itinerary. (Is it under surveillance? Has it been condemned?)\n\nComedy, of which there is plenty, arises from the characters\u2019 capacity for surprise \u2014 Goldberg for no apparent reason sticks out his tongue \u2014 and from Pinter\u2019s self-evident delight in the effect of certain words. Ms. Wanamaker\u2019s Meg looks taken aback early on by Petey\u2019s use of the adjective \u201csucculent\u201d \u2014 one that is clearly more suggestive than she is used to.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fourth-quarter estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months, and it could increase or drop by as much as a percentage point, based on previous recalculations. After all, government statisticians have to put together the fourth-quarter estimate without complete data on construction, trade and inventories.\n\nMr. Trump inherited an improving economy, and during his first year in office, the trend continued and growth accelerated. Supporters credit Mr. Trump with revving up business and consumer confidence, and say tax cuts and eased regulation are fueling capital investment and job creation. They also point to a booming stock market, though market gains are not necessarily a gauge of economic underpinnings.\n\nThe president ticked off those items on Friday when he hailed America\u2019s economic strength at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, where global leaders have been sharing encouraging economic news all week.\n\nThe American economy recovered from a plodding start in the first three months of 2017, when sharp cuts in consumer spending limited G.D.P. growth to 1.2 percent on an annualized basis. It sprang back over the next six months, with the rate reaching 3.1 percent in the second quarter and 3.2 percent in the third.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, holiday shoppers were enthusiastic, and spending on business and residential housing was up. A persistent appetite for foreign goods continued to widen the trade deficit \u2014 it reached nearly $72 billion for goods alone in December \u2014 and dragged down gains. But inventory declines that detracted from G.D.P. last quarter should rebound over the next as businesses refill empty shelves.\n\nThe American economy\u2019s performance has also been buoyed by simultaneous growth in nations around the world, which has fueled trade and enabled foreign consumers to buy more American-made products.\n\nFor several years after the recession, the United States\u2019 steady if unremarkable growth was a bright spot compared with struggling economies abroad. Under President Barack Obama, who took office when the economy was floundering, yearly growth averaged 2.1 percent during the recovery.

In several, growth rates outpaced that of the United States. Among large economies in the Group of 7, the United States ranked fifth, according to a report from the World Economic Forum. On a list of 29 advanced economies, it ranked 10th, though it sank close to the bottom in terms of equitably sharing the gains.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExhilarating stock market gains have also been a worldwide phenomenon. Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, pointed out that the major stock indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, Germany and South Korea registered gains comparable to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, if not better.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. performance doesn\u2019t stand out relative to the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe I.M.F. warned against assuming that the current economic cycle would go on indefinitely, however, particularly given the towering debt of the United States and other countries. By borrowing so much, the government can crowd out other investors and drive up interest rates. At the same time, giant deficits crank up pressure to cut government spending on health care and housing, policing and schools. With less money to go around, spending dries up and consumer demand \u2014 the economy\u2019s primary engine \u2014 slows.\n\n\u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers must stay mindful that the current economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the I.M.F.\u2019s chief economist.\n\nDespite all the attention that the growth statistics engender, economists warn against reading too much into G.D.P. figures. In recent years, more and more experts have noted the increasing difficulty in measuring a knowledge-based economy where services like Facebook and Google are free and innovations and improvements often lack an accurate price tag.\n\nAn additional, unexpected flaw in recent United States data may come more sharply into focus this year. G.D.P. figures may have been artificially lowered over the last decade because of tax policies that encouraged domestic-based multinationals to shift billions of dollars in domestic profits overseas.\n\nAfter Ireland became a tax haven, its growth rate suddenly rocketed to more than 25 percent in 2015. At least a portion of what was counted, however, had been generated in the United States and should have been counted toward American growth, said Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. A significant chunk of the United States trade gap has been caused by companies overstating imports from their foreign subsidiaries and underreporting exports, Mr. Auerbach said.\n\nOne analysis estimated that such accounting methods subtracted $280 billion from the tally of the nation\u2019s output in 2012. The new tax law reworks many of those international provisions. Those changes \u201cshould somewhat temper the incentives\u201d to book money offshore, said Fatih Guvenen, one of the authors of the analysis, \u201cbut still doesn\u2019t eliminate them.\u201d\n\nThe tax-code changes could muddy attempts to measure growth in 2018, and possibly 2019, though. If enough companies stop disguising significant domestic profits as foreign, G.D.P. in the United States would suddenly expand \u2014 without any underlying change in output.\n\n\u201cOver the next couple of years, I think there will be a one-time jump in the level of G.D.P. because the profits that Apple, Google, Facebook and others attributed to an offshore tax haven affiliate will now appear in their U.S. accounts,\u201d said Mr. Guvenen, an economics professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf it happens at a larger scale, it will give the appearance of faster G.D.P. growth,\u201d he said.", "title": "U.S. Economy Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter", "authors": ["Patricia Cohen"]}

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "The timing of the move has caused tensions between Mr. Tillerson and the White House. Mr. Friedman, who worked as a lawyer for Mr. Trump, pushed to move the embassy this year, and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who oversees the president\u2019s Middle East peace initiative, backed him.\n\nBut Mr. Tillerson petitioned Mr. Trump in a meeting on Thursday for more time to upgrade the security of the building, and the president agreed. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see from the secretary is that we will do this at the pace of security, not at the pace of politics,\u201d said the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, Steven Goldstein.\n\nThe Arnona building sits near the Green Line, which served as the de facto border of the state of Israel from 1949 until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. While the building, which now issues visas and offers consular services to American citizens, would need to be retrofitted for the ambassador to conduct classified operations, it is a fairly new structure with better physical security than the embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe timetable for moving the embassy became a charged footnote to Mr. Trump\u2019s landmark decision. When the president signed a proclamation in December recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, he quietly signed another document waiving a congressional demand that the United States move the embassy to Jerusalem within six months.\n\nAt the time, White House officials said practical and logistical considerations drove the decision. The State Department, they said, could not open a functioning embassy in Jerusalem on the timetable stipulated under a 1995 law that requires the president to sign a national security waiver every six months to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\nScouting a site, commissioning a design and building the embassy compound could take up to six years, according to State Department officials, and cost $600 million to $1 billion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

American ambassadors have sometimes shuttled between offices in countries like Myanmar, which built new capital cities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut putting off the move also had diplomatic advantages for a White House eager to keep alive the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It avoided creating a tangible symbol of Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy and spared the White House a series of decisions \u2014 like where in the city to place the embassy \u2014 that would begin to define the geography of the president\u2019s deliberately general statement about Jerusalem.\n\nSince Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, however, relations between the United States and the Palestinians have curdled. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, vowed never again to take part in peace negotiations brokered by the United States. In a recent speech to Palestinian officials, he said of Mr. Trump, \u201cMay your house be destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe administration, in turn, said it would withhold $65 million \u2014 or more than half the funding that the United States generally provides \u2014 to a United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees.\n\nThe decision was a rebuke to the United Nations, whose members voted by a lopsided margin last month to condemn the United States for its Jerusalem decision. It also reflected the view of some in the White House that the organization, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, needed to be overhauled and was impeding, rather than aiding, the peace process.\n\nMoving the embassy quickly, officials said, could also be a political boon for Mr. Trump in a midterm election year, given the popularity of his decision to recognize Jerusalem with evangelical voters and hard-line pro-Israel Americans like the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson.\n\nMr. Trump, a former property developer, has taken a personal interest in the location and cost of embassies. This month, he said on Twitter that he had canceled a planned visit to London out of pique that the Obama administration had sold \u201cthe best located and finest embassy in London for \u2018peanuts,\u2019 only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars.\u201d\n\nThe George W. Bush administration made the decision to close the embassy at Grosvenor Square in Mayfair and build a new tower south of the Thames River, at a cost of more than $1 billion.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said of the Jerusalem embassy: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at doing a beautiful embassy, but not one that costs $1.2 billion.

{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "With South Korea, the White House\u2019s overarching goal for renegotiating the trade pact is to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit, which was $17 billion in 2016. But analysts view such a goal with skepticism, saying that the tendency of the United States to import more than it exports is linked to larger economic factors like saving and spending rates, not the terms of trade agreements.\n\nEach side was likely to look to the other on Friday to articulate their goals for the renegotiation, said Wendy Cutler, the former chief United States negotiator for the deal. The United States will probably focus on areas of the agreement that it believes have not met its expectations, Ms. Cutler said, including trade in automobiles and, potentially, financial services and procedures related to importing goods.\n\nShe noted that the Trump administration had not notified Congress of its intention to renegotiate the agreement, something that is required before substantial changes are made. That may suggest that the United States is not seeking to significantly alter the terms of the deal or that, although it is seeking changes from South Korea, it is not willing to make big concessions itself.\n\nThe United States Korea Free Trade Agreement, America\u2019s largest trade pact after the North American Free Trade Agreement, was negotiated during the President George W. Bush\u2019s administration and signed by the two countries in 2007. It set off enormous protests from Koreans in 2008 over concerns about the safety of imported goods, such as beef. And it was not ratified by Congress until 2011, after President Barack Obama reworked the pact.\n\nThe agreement took effect in March 2012, cutting almost all tariffs and many other trade barriers between the countries. The deal opened South Korea, now the United States\u2019 seventh-largest export market for goods, to imports of American agriculture, services and investment, and the American market to Korean cars and other manufactured goods like washing machines.\n\nTrade officials estimated in 2007 that the lower barriers to trade under the agreement would increase annual exports of American goods by up to $11 billion, a claim that Mr. Obama repeated.\n\nBut, as the Trump administration has argued, that did not happen.\n\n\u201cSince KORUS went into effect, our trade deficit in goods with Korea has doubled from $13.2 billion to $27.6 billion, while U.S. goods exports have actually gone down,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer, said in a statement in July. \u201cThis is quite different from what the previous administration sold to the American people when it urged approval of this agreement. We can and must do better.\u201d\n\nMuch of the American trade deficit in goods with Korea is generated by automobiles, a key reason cars will probably be a primary focus of the talks. Korean car brands like Hyundai and Kia are popular in the United States, but American carmakers have struggled to gain as much ground in South Korea as their European and Asian competitors.", "title": "U.S. and South Korea Start Trade Talks Amid Rising Tensions", "authors": []}

We now know that the president at the time, Steve Penny, called the mother of Maggie Nichols the day after her coach overheard her discussing Dr. Nassar\u2019s treatment and raised the alarm \u2014 to dissuade them from reporting the doctor directly to law enforcement. The confidential $1.25 million settlement the organization struck with McKayla Maroney required her to remain silent.

But senior operatives insisted on additional combat exercise and dry runs on an adjacent airstrip, and while they were carrying out that training, the plane took off for Yemen. There, the militants executed the pilot; they then forced the co-pilot to fly the jetliner to Somalia.\n\nAs the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, held discussions with Somalia\u2019s president, Mohammed Siad Barre, Colonel Wegener\u2019s commandos quietly flew to Mogadishu, under the direction of Hans-J\u00fcrgen Wischnewski, the minister designated to deal with the crisis. The militants were falsely told that their comrades had been released.\n\nAround 2 a.m. on Oct. 18, Somali soldiers lit a fire 65 yards in front of the jet, creating a diversion. As the hostage takers entered the cockpit to see what was going on, Colonel Wegener and his commandos stormed the aircraft. Over the next seven minutes, three militants were killed and the fourth was wounded. Three passengers, a flight attendant and a commando were injured. But all 86 passengers, along with the four surviving crew members, were saved.\n\nLater that night, three members of the Red Army Faction \u2014 Gudrun Ensslin, Jan-Carl Raspe and Andreas Baader \u2014 were found dead in their cells, having committed suicide, and Mr. Schleyer, the abducted executive, was murdered.\n\nMr. Schmidt later said that he would have resigned if the operation had failed.\n\nMr. Wegener continued to command GSG-9 until 1979.

She encourages those who want to be helpful to \u201cbear witness,\u201d to offer friendship without probing questions or unsolicited advice, help if it is needed and wanted, and a listening ear no matter how often mourners wish to tell their story.\n\nTo those who grieve, she suggests finding a nondestructive way to express it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell your story to another human, find another way: journal, paint, make your grief into a graphic novel with a very dark story line. Or go out to the woods and tell the trees. It is an immense relief to be able to tell your story without someone trying to fix it.\u201d\n\nShe also suggests keeping a journal that records situations that either intensify or relieve suffering. \u201cAre there times you feel more stable, more grounded, more able to breathe inside your loss? Does anything \u2014 a person, a place, an activity \u2014 add to your energy bank account?

In the next round, she will face the crafty Anastasija Sevastova, who beat Sharapova at last year\u2019s U.S. Open.\n\n\u201cI missed a lot of swing volleys at the U.S. Open,\u201d Sharapova said of that loss to Sevastova. \u201cJust going back home, my father made me hit swing volleys till I was blue in the face. It\u2019s not an easy match, not an easy match for anyone, especially for an aggressive player like I am. You know, she\u2019s an opponent that tests my patience, and I\u2019m willing to be there and out there for as long as it takes.\u201d\n\nIf Sharapova survives that match, she will most likely face a revitalized Angelique Kerber in the third round. Kerber won the title here in 2016 and eventually rose to No. 1 before struggling through the 2017 season. But she is back on the rise under new management: her veteran coach Wim Fissette. And after winning the title in Sydney last week, she defeated Anna-Lena Friedsam, her German compatriot, 6-0, 6-4 in Melbourne on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cEvery draw is different and has its own challenges, and people are saying I have a tough draw,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cThese are the players I want to be playing.\u201d\n\nAfter having watched from afar, playing, in her view, definitely beats the alternative.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a teenager I didn\u2019t think I would be playing past 30, definitely not, and here I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I might surprise myself on when I finish, and I don\u2019t know when that will be.\u201d", "title": "Unseeded Maria Sharapova Returns to Australian Open as a Star", "authors": ["Christopher Clarey"]}

But in early adolescence she lost interest in science fiction, because, she recalled, the stories \u201cseemed to be all about hardware and soldiers: White men go forth and conquer the universe.\u201d\n\nShe graduated from Radcliffe College in 1951, earned a master\u2019s degree in romance literature of the Middle Ages and Renaissance from Columbia University in 1952, and won a Fulbright fellowship to study in Paris. There she met and married another Fulbright scholar, Charles Le Guin, who survives her.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn their return to the United States, she abandoned her graduate studies to raise a family; the Le Guins eventually settled in Portland, where Mr. Le Guin taught history at Portland State University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBesides her husband and son, Ms. Le Guin is survived by two daughters, Caroline and Elisabeth Le Guin; two brothers, Theodore and Clifton Kroeber; and four grandchildren.\n\nBy the early 1960s Ms. Le Guin had written five unpublished novels, mostly set in an imaginary Central European country called Orsinia. Eager to find a more welcoming market, she decided to try her hand at genre fiction.\n\nHer first science-fiction novel, \u201cRocannon\u2019s World,\u201d came out in 1966. Two years later she published \u201cA Wizard of Earthsea,\u201d the first in a series about a made-up world where the practice of magic is as precise as any science, and as morally ambiguous.\n\nThe first three Earthsea books \u2014 the other two were \u201cThe Tombs of Atuan\u201d (1971) and \u201cThe Farthest Shore\u201d (1972) \u2014 were written, at the request of her publisher, for young adults.

The book won the two major prizes in science fiction, the Hugo and Nebula awards, and is widely taught in secondary schools and colleges.\n\nMuch of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s science fiction has a common background: a loosely knit confederation of worlds known as the Ekumen.

There were two made-for-television versions, one on PBS in 1980 and the other on the A&E cable channel in 2002.\n\nAmong the other adaptations of her work were the 2006 Japanese animated feature \u201cTales From Earthsea\u201d and a 2004 mini-series on the Sci Fi channel, \u201cLegend of Earthsea.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of the 1980 \u201cLathe of Heaven,\u201d she had little good to say about any of them.\n\nMs. Le Guin always considered herself a feminist, even when genre conventions led her to center her books on male heroes. Her later works, like the additions to the Earthsea series and such Ekumen tales as \u201cFour Ways to Forgiveness\u201d (1995) and \u201cThe Telling\u201d (2000), are mostly told from a female point of view.\n\nIn some of her later books, she gave in to a tendency toward didacticism, as if she were losing patience with humanity for not learning the hard lessons \u2014 about the need for balance and compassion \u2014 that her best work so astutely embodies.\n\nAt the 2014 National Book Awards, Ms. Le Guin was given the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She accepted the medal on behalf of her fellow writers of fantasy and science fiction, who, she said, had been \u201cexcluded from literature for so long\u201d while literary honors went to the \u201cso-called realists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe also urged publishers and writers not to put too much emphasis on profits.\n\n\u201cI have had a long career and a good one,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cHere at the end of it, I really don\u2019t want to watch American literature get sold down the river.\u201d", "title": "Ursula K.

Partners in their firms would be limited to $3,850 in each election cycle, roughly the same general election cap as exists for borough president candidates under city rules, the report said.\n\n\u201cMy campaign will meet and exceed these recommendations,\u201d Mr. Vance said in a statement.\n\nDonations to candidates running for district attorney from defense lawyers are legal in New York and have been made since the 19th century. Individual contribution limits are based on the number of voters in a county. In Manhattan, the legal donation limit in a general election is $50,000.\n\nThe recommendations in the 38-page report are aimed at limiting the influence of donations on the criminal justice system. The report said district attorneys should never accept donations from people under investigation or indictment, or from assistant district attorneys.\n\nIt also recommended prosecutors enforce a strict separation between their campaign and office staffs, so that the district attorney\u2019s office has no knowledge of who has offered financial support.\n\nThe report suggested limits of $250 for lawyers with pending cases in counties with smaller populations.\n\nPerhaps the most radical recommendations involved keeping the list of donors secret from sitting district attorneys, and banning prosecutors from soliciting contributions in person.\n\nMr. Vance said he did not expect other district attorneys in the state to follow his lead, but he believed the blind approach to raising money would allay public concerns that lawyers could buy leniency for their clients.

Most do not have any written policy regarding campaign donations, she said.\n\nIf all the state\u2019s district attorneys voluntarily adopted the recommendations, Ms. Rodgers said, it would go a long way toward eliminating the appearance that contributions can buy a prosecutor\u2019s decision.\n\nBut she said a voluntary system has limitations. Some incumbents and challengers may not opt to follow the guidelines. Only a change in state law would ensure everyone across the state is playing by the same rules, she said.\n\n\u201cIt definitely is something that should be addressed by the Legislature,\u201d she said.\n\nSusan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, called Mr. Vance\u2019s decision \u201ca really strong step in the right direction,\u201d but she said the Legislature should now codify the recommendations into law.\n\nEven if voluntarily followed by all candidates, the guidelines may not remove the influence of campaign money entirely. For instance, under the center\u2019s recommendations, district attorneys would still be allowed to attend fund-raising events where they could give campaign speeches. They would be able to see who attended the event, but in theory the candidate would not know how much each person donated. The report also acknowledged that there is no way to stop a candidate from learning the identities of donors through public websites maintained by the city and state election boards.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the $6.1 million in contributions to Mr. Vance, who was re-elected in November, came from lawyers.

The report will aid the agency in its review of applications for lower-risk tobacco products and the potential harm or benefits those pose to individuals and the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, an F.D.A. advisory panel will review an application from Philip Morris International for iQOS, an electronic device that, unlike e-cigarettes, contains tobacco in a stick that the company says heats it but does not burn it. It releases nicotine vapor, which the company says is less hazardous than smoke. If approved, Philip Morris would be the first company allowed by the government to claim its product is less harmful than cigarettes.\n\nAlso this week, on Friday, the agency\u2019s new nicotine steering committee will hold a public hearing on over-the-counter therapeutic products, among them gums, patches and lozenges, designed to help smokers quit.\n\n[READ: The health effects of e-cigarettes]\n\nCessation was one area where the committee\u2019s report did give the booming e-cigarette industry some good news. It pointed out the benefits for smokers trying to quit. But people who continue to smoke cigarettes, alternating with e-cigarettes, do not gain the same health benefits, the committee said. That\u2019s especially important given that most adults who vape also still smoke or use other tobacco products. The report also said the evidence was limited on whether e-cigarettes were effective for quitting smoking.\n\nWhile there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes or their components cause cancer, the committee recommended more long-term research. Some e-cigarettes contain chemicals and metals whose long-term effects \u2014 including on pregnancy \u2014 also need further study, the committee said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmoking rates among adults and teenagers have declined significantly over the last few decades. In 2015, the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has statistics, about 37 million Americans, 15 percent of adults aged 18 and older, smoked cigarettes. The number has declined from nearly 21 percent of every 100 adults in 2005; and 42 percent in 1965.\n\nWith that decline, the e-cigarette industry has emerged as a potential substitute and Big Tobacco has been among the device developers enjoying new profits from the tobacco alternatives. Bonnie Herzog, a Wells Fargo tobacco analyst, predicted the industry will grow about 15 percent to $5.1 billion in retail sales in the United States, in 2018.\n\nThe vaping industry, as well as traditional tobacco companies, are gearing up for a lengthy fight with the F.D.A. over the campaign by the agency\u2019s commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, to slash levels of nicotine in traditional cigarettes to nonaddictive or minimally addictive levels.\n\nDr. Gottlieb is expected to issue an initial proposal, calling for public comment on lower nicotine levels, in the near future.\n\nThe new report reflects the complexity of the issues surrounding e-cigarettes and the balancing act regulators face over the pros and cons of the alternatives to conventional cigarettes.\n\nAdam Leventhal, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, and an author of the report, said his group did an exhaustive literature search, reviewing all studies on youths and e-cigarette use from around the world. Of those, 10 studies were deemed strong enough to address the question. But they did not show that using e-cigarettes caused teens to move on to tobacco, only that the use of e-cigarettes was associated with later smoking of at least one traditional cigarette. The report noted that more than 11 percent of all high school students \u2014 nearly 1.7 million youths \u2014 reported using e-cigarettes within the past month.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cThe evidence was substantial that this association was consistent across a number of research methodologies, age ranges, locations, and research groups in and outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Leventhal said.\n\nThis conclusion is at odds with the findings of the British Royal College of Physicians, which asserts that e-cigarettes are not a gateway to smoking.\n\n\u201cConcerns about e-cigarettes helping to recruit a new generation of tobacco smokers through a gateway effect are, at least to date, unfounded,\u201d the organization notes on its website.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore intriguing was the newest report\u2019s finding of moderate evidence that youths who use e-cigarettes before trying tobacco are more likely to become more frequent and intense smokers.\n\nCritics have long contended that the flavored liquids for the devices are luring adolescents to the habit, at a time when nicotine is especially hazardous for their brain development. Three of the top-selling flavors at e-liquid.com, a large online retailer, include \u201cUnicorn Milk\u201d (strawberries and cream), \u201cTNT\u201d (strawberry, apple and peach) and \u201cI Love Donuts\u201d (blueberries and pastry).\n\nThe authors of the new report cite conclusive evidence that vaping can be addictive, and that exposure to nicotine from e-cigarettes is highly variable, depends on the characteristics of the device, as well as how it is used. They also cited conclusive proof that in addition to nicotine, most e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially toxic substances.\n\nIn terms of second-hand vapor, the committee said there was conclusive evidence that e-cigarette use increases airborne concentrations of particulate matter and nicotine indoors.\n\nThe report concluded that much of the current research on e-cigarettes is flawed, either in methodology or because of industry-financed bias. In addition, the levels of nicotine and other chemicals, including metals, vary in e-cigarettes from brand to brand.\n\n\u201cAnd for kids who initiate on e-cigarettes, there\u2019s a great chance of intensive use of cigarettes. As the regulator, we\u2019ve got to factor all that in,\u201d Mr. Zeller said.\n\nIn July, the F.D.A. delayed the deadline at least four years for e-cigarette companies to apply for approval to keep their products on the market, largely by showing some public health benefit.\n\nSeveral major tobacco companies that produce e-cigarettes declined to comment on the report. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company issued a statement saying it was encouraged by the report\u2019s findings, and highlighted the committee\u2019s point that e-cigarettes \u201care likely to be far less harmful than conventional cigarettes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut public health advocates who objected to the July delay said this report gave them further concern.\n\n\u201cWhat the report demonstrates is that despite the popularity of e-cigarettes, little is known about their overall health effects, and there is wide variability from product to product,\u201d said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cThat makes the case even stronger for F.D.A. regulation.\u201d\n\nThe vaping industry was cautiously optimistic about the report. Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit that advocates for vapor products, said the findings were consistent with those reached by the Royal College of Physicians and other institutions in Britain that have issued reports indicating e-cigarettes are less dangerous than traditional smoking and help with cessation.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of this report, it is more apparent than ever that true leadership is needed in public health to ensure that adult smokers have access to truthful information about the benefits of switching to smoke-free products,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the F.D.A., Dr. Gottlieb said the report would play a critical role.\n\n\u201cWe need to put novel products like e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to fully evaluate their risks and maximize their potential benefits,\u201d he said.", "title": "Vaping Can Be Addictive and May Lure Teenagers to Smoking, Science Panel Concludes", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan"]}

He plays an inspector named Efra\u00edn Robles who rescues a Venezuelan businessman from kidnappers.\n\nHe said the idea to act in the film had come to him after a police operation in a poor neighborhood in Caracas, where he met a young man on the verge of joining a gang. Mr. P\u00e9rez saw no way of talking him out of crime, but noticed how influenced the young man was by what he saw on television.\n\n\u201cHe literally forgot his hunger watching TV,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was there you see the great power of audiovisual mediums, of movies.\u201d\n\nThe film foreshadows the theatrics Mr. P\u00e9rez would become known for in real life. His character \u2014 also a pilot \u2014 chases criminals through the streets of the capital from the air, and in the finale, he scuba dives with a rifle to the yacht of the villain.\n\nMr. P\u00e9rez said the movie also showed the kind of police force that he wished had existed in Venezuela: Mug shots displayed on high-tech screens.

But they have said that they notified residents of the danger and decided which areas to evacuate based on input from weather, fire and flood experts.\n\nLike several other victims in the neighborhood, Alice and James Mitchell chose to stay home because they were not under mandatory evacuation, said their daughter, Kelly Weimer. The couple, married more than 50 years, had left for the wildfire and were still packed in case the floods forced them to leave again.\n\nSo the Mitchells stayed in for dinner to celebrate Mr. Mitchell\u2019s 89th birthday and went to bed early.

A huge hole had taken the place of the living room in Ms. Gower\u2019s home. Initially, Mr. Borgatello tried to get himself out of the mud, using his arms to pull his body up. But after he began shivering, he told Ms. Haigh, he realized he would be warmer if he stayed covered in the muck. Mr. Borgatello was released from the hospital Wednesday, she said, and has repeatedly spoken with some confusion about the night.\n\n\u201cShe looked at least 10 years younger than she was,\u201d said Ms. Haigh, 35, adding that her mother swam at the local YMCA daily and kept her hair platinum blond. \u201cShe would have lived to be 100.

But that means motivating Russians to go to the polls.\n\nAt first, as several Russian news outlets reported, the goal was the \u201c70/70\u201d formula, meaning the administration wanted Mr. Putin to start his fourth presidential term having secured 70 percent of the vote with a turnout of 70 percent.\n\nIt would match the roughly 70 percent support and 70 percent turnout that Dmitri A. Medvedev won in 2008 as Mr. Putin\u2019s substitute for one term as president. At a minimum, by many accounts, Mr. Putin wants to surpass the nearly 64 percent support he received in 2012 with a turnout of more than 65 percent.\n\nTrustworthy polling numbers are elusive, but most analysts believe Mr. Putin will fall well short of his goal, with turnout of around 55 to 60 percent and support at about the same or slightly higher.\n\nPhoto\n\nParticularly vexing for the Kremlin is that Mr. Putin\u2019s current numbers do not match his favorability ratings, which have consistently been above 80 percent since he annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClearly, though, Russian voters are less and less interested in voting, as all manifestations of vitality have been drained from the process. Free elections, a free news media, free political parties and other hallmarks of democracy have been gradually eliminated or sharply restrained, starting even before Mr. Putin first became president in 2000 but accelerating thereafter.\n\nBarely 48 percent of the electorate turned out for the September 2016 parliamentary elections, although the presidential vote is expected to generate greater interest.\n\nThe oddball characters the Kremlin has allowed to oppose Mr. Putin are not about to light any electoral fires, with their support mired in single digits.\n\n\u201cSome figures are allowed in, like backup dancers,\u201d said Lev D. Gudkov, director of the Levada Center. Perhaps the most reliable polling organization on Russian politics, the center just announced it would sit out the election, having been labeled a \u201cforeign agent\u201d for receiving grants from abroad, and thus barred by law from political activity.\n\nThe most recognizable candidate is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 71, a wily nationalist known for his political antics who has been a stalwart of the opposition for decades. Another perennial, Gennadi Zughanov, 73, the Communist Party leader who has run in four presidential elections and nearly won in 1996, has dropped out.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe surprise Communist Party candidate is Pavel N. Grudinin, 57, the director of a farming enterprise whose name, the Lenin State Farm, is redolent of the Communist era. But his ownership stake in what is actually a privatized agricultural company pays him more than $350,000 a year, inspiring the moniker \u201cCommunist Billionaire\u201d on social media.\n\nThe smattering of liberals includes Ksenia Sobchak, 36, a reality TV star and the daughter of Mr. Putin\u2019s political mentor, as well as Grigory Yavlinsky, 65, another longtime opposition figure.\n\nNone represents a real challenge to Mr. Putin.\n\nThere is one surefire way for the Kremlin to electrify the voters \u2014 allowing the candidacy of Alexei A.

He has also called for nationwide protests on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Mr. Navalny was unlikely to pose a real challenge to Mr. Putin given the president\u2019s significant popularity. But an official presidential run would give him a public platform to further publicize his accusations of corruption against the Kremlin, including possibly the president himself, potentially tarnishing what amounts to Mr. Putin\u2019s coronation.\n\nPlus there is always the possibility of an electoral surprise, and Mr. Putin hates surprises. He has shown a marked distaste for elections ever since he helped to organize a losing 1996 mayoral campaign in St. Petersburg.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn about 15 regions of Russia, what Mr. Oreshkin calls \u201celectoral sultanates,\u201d Mr. Putin can count on Soviet-style support. In the Chechen Republic under the strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, for example, Mr. Putin in 2012 received more than 99 percent of the votes cast with more than 99 percent turnout.\n\nThose regions account for only about 10 percent of the electorate, however, and fantastic numbers like those in Chechnya are considered an embarrassment in the modern era.\n\nIf there is an element of competition in the race, it is actually between senior bureaucrats to see who can generate the most support for Mr. Putin. The prize might be a federal post, with expectations high that Mr. Putin will try to dispel a certain sense of stagnation by shaking up his cabinet after the election.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s election campaign becomes an election campaign for his servants, where the electorate is just a platform to demonstrate your skills and political-administrative talents,\u201d wrote Tatyana Stanovaya, the chief analyst for the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank, in an op-ed for Republic.ru.\n\nRegional leaders will resemble carnival barkers as they try to lift the numbers, turning Election Day into something of a festival, Russian news outlets have reported. That includes fairs, flash mobs spurring people to vote and possible prizes like a new iPhone for the most creative selfie posted from a polling place.\n\nMuch of it is aimed at getting young people to the polls.

The N.F.C. championship in Philadelphia next weekend will feature two reserves elevated by injury, a matchup of Nick Foles and Keenum, teammates on that paragon of mediocrity known as the 2015 St. Louis Rams. In a league where the quality of quarterback so often defines the quality of a team, the conference finalists reinforce the value of having a complete roster.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s defense is loaded with stars at every position, but its offense, Diggs noted, is populated by castoffs and misfits and low draft picks. Keenum went undrafted, as did receiver Adam Thielen.\n\nThey stood on the sideline and watched Wil Lutz drill a go-ahead 43-yarder with 25 seconds left, which incited a few Saints personnel to head into in the press box to exclaim that they were headed to the N.F.C. championship. Some fans departed, numbed, perhaps, by the anguish.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKeenum had been waiting his entire peripatetic career for a moment like the one that came next. He had those 25 seconds to guide the Vikings roughly 50 yards \u2014 into the desired field-goal range of kicker Kai Forbath, whose 53-yarder with 1 minute 29 seconds left had pushed Minnesota ahead by 23-21. His task, all at once, was to rescue his defense, demonstrate his season was more revelation than fluke and lift his team, and a fan base grated by playoff misery, to victory.\n\nAfter gaining 19 yards on one completion across the first three plays, to their own 39, the Vikings left the ensuing huddle with Keenum\u2019s words echoing in their ears: \u201cI\u2019m going to give somebody a chance.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Vikings practice the play regularly. It is a staple, receiver Wright said, of their Saturday preparation, and they had actually run it a few times earlier in the game. Wright ran an out, as did tight end Kyle Rudolph. The Vikings had no timeouts, and since those routes direct them toward the sideline, where the clock would stop if they stepped out after making a catch, Wright figured he would be the first option.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was amazing,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt was meant for us.\u201d\n\nAs Diggs tracked the ball, cornerback Terence Newman, watching on the sideline, knew he would catch it. \u201cHave you seen Stefon jump?\u201d he said. Leaping a few feet, Diggs hovered above Saints safety Marcus Williams, who made the critical gaffe of lowering his shoulder to hit him \u2014 but missed, instead striking teammate Ken Crawley.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The retailer\u2019s extra spending on hourly wages is just a sliver of what it could save in taxes, though \u2014 and a tight labor market is likely to have been a more potent driver.\n\nWalmart will raise its hourly rate for starting staff to $11 in the United States, the third upward move in three years. Assuming a 40-hour workweek, the $300 million increase the company expects in its wage bill would suggest fewer than one in 10 workers in the United States will benefit directly. Put another way, the raise is equivalent to just 0.3 percent of the company\u2019s sales and administration costs.\n\nMoreover, the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent means that Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, in theory, had room to give away much more. The company is forecast to make $20.3 billion of pretax profit in 2018. Around three-quarters of that comes from the United States, which suggests a tax savings of $2.1 billion. Factor in the one-off bonuses the company is paying to some staff, at a total cost of $400 million, and Walmart is giving back only around one-third of what it could save in taxes.\n\nIn fairness, there are other demands on Walmart\u2019s tax windfall.

The mainstream appeal of his films helped turn winter sports from a niche pursuit to a widely popular pastime and a multibillion-dollar industry.\n\n\u201cWarren Miller is the man who made the snowball that created the whole industry,\u201d Dirk Collins, a founder of the adventure sports production company Teton Gravity Research, told Outside magazine for a 2004 profile of Mr. Miller.\n\nWithout any cinematic training, while working as a ski instructor in Sun Valley, Mr. Miller created \u201cDeep and Light\u201d in 1949 using a borrowed 16-millimeter movie camera. It was the first of more than 500 feature and promotional films he made.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis feature films hewed to a simple formula, depicting winter-sport athletes in challenging locales, leavened with wipeouts and shots of pretty female skiers. Performers spanned generations, including Jean-Claude Killy, who won three Olympic gold medals in 1968, and Stein Eriksen, who won one in 1952. But in all his movies, the narration of Mr. Miller, who delivered deadpan wisecracks in his trademark baritone, loomed largest.\n\n\u201cLooking back on what set my films apart,\u201d he recalled in his autobiography, \u201cFreedom Found\u201d (2016), \u201cit was the emphasis on entertaining people, which means making them laugh.\u201d\n\nHaving known privation while growing up during the Depression and in his early days as a ski bum, Mr. Miller was no snob. He was inclusive in his embrace of the mountain scene, featuring fads such as freestyle ballet skiing and snow kayaking in his films. His \u201cEscape to Ski\u201d (1988) championed snowboarding at a time when that upstart activity was barred at many ski resorts across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the first 14 years of his career, Mr. Miller provided all the photography, editing and music for his movies, and spent up to eight months traveling to mountain locations around the world. He screened his films in rented halls with live narration, a practice developed by the ski cinema pioneer John Jay.\n\nAs skiing grew in popularity, so did Mr. Miller\u2019s films. By 1960 he was booked for screenings in more than 100 cities. Unable to attend every show, he began recording narration. His audience did not seem to mind. Mr. Miller\u2019s films became an annual autumn rite among skiers looking forward to the season\u2019s first snows.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s films also kept pace with new styles of skiing and innovations in the sport over the decades. In 1954 he filmed Stein Eriksen performing a front flip on skis, one of the earliest examples of what would become known as freestyle skiing. In 1985 he released \u201cSteep and Deep,\u201d a film that featured a fresh generation of extreme skiers who launched from cliffs and performed tricks and showed how far freestyle skiing had come in three decades.\n\nBorn on Oct. 15, 1924, in Hollywood, Mr. Miller was the youngest of three children. His father, Albert, was a radio actor, and his mother, Elena, sewed quilts for the Works Progress Administration during the Depression.\n\nMr. Miller learned to ski as a Boy Scout on trips to the San Gabriel Mountains, north of Los Angeles. In 1942 he enrolled in a naval officers\u2019 training program at the University of Southern California, where he studied astrophysics. He left the university to serve in the Pacific during World War II. Discharged in 1946, he bought his first movie camera with a $100 Navy bonus and set off for the mountains.\n\nIn 1989 Mr. Miller sold Warren Miller Entertainment \u2014 including his archives and the rights to his voice and name \u2014 to his son Kurt and a partner. He continued to narrate films until 2005 as the company changed hands again, first to Time Warner in 2002, then to the Bonnier Corporation, a Swedish publisher. Active Interest Media acquired the company in 2013.\n\nIn September 2009, Warren Miller Entertainment sued a Colorado production company for copyright infringement after Mr. Miller narrated one of its films, arguing that he had relinquished the right to use his name and voice in other ski films when he sold the company. Mr. Miller, in turn, filed a motion to intervene, essentially asking that the Miller company sue him instead. A year later, an arbitration panel determined that Mr. Miller\u2019s appearance in the film did not cause harm to the company and that Mr. Miller was free to use his own name, likeness, voice and brand in anything outside of ski movies.\n\nVideo\n\nIn 2016 he returned to narrate a section of a Warren Miller Entertainment film, \u201cHere, There & Everywhere,\u201d featuring the skier Ingrid Backstrom and the rider Jeremy Jones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to his son Kurt, Mr. Miller is survived by his wife of 30 years, Laurie; another son, Scott; a daughter, Chris Lucero; a stepson, Colin Kaufmann; and five grandchildren.\n\nMr. Miller continued to write a weekly column about the outdoors for several small newspapers in the West and served as honorary director of skiing at the Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., an exclusive enclave whose members have included Bill Gates and former Vice President Dan Quayle.\n\nIn a 2008 speech, Mr. Miller summed up with uncharacteristic seriousness what had led him \u2014 as well as ski bums and heads of state and corporations \u2014 to head for the mountains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our search for freedom, \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2014 man\u2019s instinctive search for freedom.\u201d", "title": "Warren Miller, Ski Bum Turned Filmmaker, Is Dead at 93", "authors": ["Matt Higgins"]}

And in Tennessee, a lawmaker withdrew his proposal to give state backing to school officials who impose restrictive bathroom policies, only eight days after he introduced it.\n\n\u201cI think people are tempering, and I think they\u2019re thinking harder about what can be achieved, what needs to be achieved,\u201d said Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois who has written extensively about the intersection of gay rights and religious freedom. \u201cThere\u2019s been a slow IV drip of common sense to legislators, and you have lots and lots of people speaking to them and saying, \u2018It\u2019s not viable to do an extreme thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor generations, and especially in the 31 months since the United States Supreme Court recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, the legislatures of the South have been a cultural battleground.\n\nMississippi passed, and has so far successfully defended in court, a law allowing people to use their religious beliefs to justify refusing to provide services to gay people. North Carolina was the setting for the legal and cultural clash over restrooms and discrimination protections that drew national attention. Last year, Alabama passed a law allowing faith-based adoption groups to refuse to work with same-sex couples and still keep their state licenses. And a candidate there who had publicly condemned gay people and tried to block same-sex marriages in the state nearly won election to the United States Senate.\n\nOn the other hand, Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia vetoed a bill that lawmakers passed in 2016 to shield religious groups from repercussions if they refused to employ or serve gay people. In Tennessee, two bills that reaffirm the state Constitution\u2019s view that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that criticize the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage as \u201ca lawless opinion with no basis in American law or history,\u201d have sputtered.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd in Texas, where some of the country\u2019s most contentious bills on gay and transgender rights have been brought up, the Legislature is not scheduled to meet at all in 2018. A \u201cbathroom bill\u201d failed twice there last year.\n\nObservers on all sides say it is too early to know with certainty whether more contentious social legislation will eventually emerge this year. But the evidence so far suggests that the pace has slowed markedly.\n\nLawmakers, advocates and experts offer several explanations for this year\u2019s apparent falloff. Washington figures prominently in some of them: Legislators are waiting to see what the Supreme Court decides in a major case involving a baker's refusal to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, some say. And many conservatives are said to be focused on pushing ahead at the federal rather than state level while Republicans control Congress and the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are also worries that lawmakers have been distracted for too long from practical issues like education and infrastructure. And some point to a creeping sense of rancor fatigue.\n\n\u201cAfter you have a bill come up two or three years in a row, or an issue, you sort of lose the fervor,\u201d said Steven Dickerson, a Republican state senator in Tennessee.\n\nSteven W. Long, a South Carolina Republican who sponsored the restroom bill that is mired in the Legislature there, said that he and people who share his views know they may not see swift action.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019re not going to see the results that we want to see overnight. It\u2019s taken us years to get where are, and it\u2019s going to take years to get us where we want to be.\u201d\n\nOne factor that seems to loom large is that, though the bills have often been popular with conservative voters, they go down very poorly with another important constituency: big business. Officials in states hoping to attract major investments from out-of-state corporations \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s second headquarters \u2014 say they drew a lesson from the boycotts and cancellations that North Carolina suffered over its bathroom bill.\n\nIn Georgia, the House speaker told a radio station that any legislation that \u201ccreates headwinds\u201d for economic development was unappealing. The governor\u2019s chief of staff, addressing an event sponsored by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said he urged Republican candidates \u201cto remember when they speak, those headlines go as quick and far as the C.E.O.\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(Those pleas may not be heeded as the campaign for governor heats up: All the major Republican contenders have vowed to support a \u201creligious freedom\u201d proposal like the one Mr. Deal blocked, under significant corporate pressure, and some lawmakers have promised to stir debate in the Legislature this year, however limited it may ultimately be.)\n\nThe economic argument has particular resonance and urgency in the South, where a handful of cities are seen as leading finalists for the Amazon project, which the company has said will lead to 50,000 new jobs. Amazon did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nIn a recent speech near Georgia\u2019s gold-topped Capitol, Mr. Deal seemed to signal that the state ought to set aside legislative proposals that might spook the Seattle-based company or try to read its mind: \u201cWe cannot waste valuable time, energy and effort, when what we should be doing is focusing on enhancing those issues which have already made us an attractive candidate to Amazon.\u201d\n\nSupporters of bills to permit faith-based exemptions from discrimination laws protecting gay people dismiss Mr. Deal\u2019s arguments as convenient cover for a lame-duck governor. In Georgia and beyond, religious conservatives contend that they have not ceded any ground.\n\n\u201cWithin our organizations and groups and constituencies, I think there\u2019s still the same energy,\u201d said Mathew D. Staver, the chairman of Liberty Counsel, which has litigated against same-sex marriage. \u201cThe battle is not just in the courts and in the legislatures; it\u2019s also in the corporate world.\u201d\n\nMr. Staver\u2019s opponents make no apologies for the evolution of their strategy, which now relies heavily on the public pressure that large companies and corporate executives can bring to bear.\n\n\u201cI think Amazon is very much part of this conversation that\u2019s happening with big business in the U.S.,\u201d said Ms. Oakley of the Human Rights Campaign. Companies, she added, are \u201csaying these bills are harmful to our ability to do business, to our employees, to the quality of life that we want our employees to be enjoying. With that voice, I think state legislatures have slowed down the momentum.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the turmoil created by these legislative efforts could resurface at any moment and throw a state legislature into sudden chaos.\n\n\u201cThings kind of ebb and flow sometimes, and most things can catch you by surprise,\u201d Mr. Snowden, the Mississippi lawmaker, observed recently. \u201cBut right now, it seems to be a period of relative calm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen he chuckled and added, \u201cThat\u2019s today.\u201d", "title": "Wary, Weary or Both, Southern Lawmakers Tone Down Culture Wars", "authors": ["Alan Blinder"]}

And the other is that pretty much anything that causes people to clear out from an area can be beneficial for wildlife.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, Dr. Pringle noted, the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea offers respite for rare species such as red-crowned cranes and Asiatic black bears.\n\nTeaming up with Dr. Pringle, Joshua Daskin, a conservation ecologist at Yale University, undertook a laborious search of 500 scientific studies, government white papers, nonprofit reports and park management documents. He sought out comparable wildlife counts, irrespective of the presence of conflict, from 1946 to 2010.\n\nThe researchers then calculated various animal population trajectories over time and compared them with known conflicts. Their final list encompassed 253 populations of 36 species of herbivorous mammals \u2014 including elephants, giraffes, zebras, hippos and wildebeests \u2014 in 126 protected areas throughout Africa.\n\nThe scientists found that it takes relatively little conflict \u2014 just one event every two to five decades \u2014 to push animal populations to lower levels. \u201cEven with the onset of what could be a fairly minor conflict from a human perspective, we see the average wildlife population declining,\u201d Dr. Daskin said.\n\nConflict frequency, in fact, was the most significant variable predicting wildlife trends among 10 other factors the researchers analyzed, including drought, the number of people living near a protected area and the degree of corruption found in a country. The more frequent the conflict, the greater the impact.\n\n\u201cThis continentwide assessment confirms what many case studies have hinted at \u2014 war is a major driver of wildlife population declines across Africa,\u201d said Kaitlyn Gaynor, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied armed conflict\u2019s influence on wildlife.\n\nThe losses are likely the result of a combination of factors, said Dr. Hillman-Smith, who spent 22 years in Garamba conserving the park and its northern white rhinos.\n\nIn times of war, poached bushmeat may feed troops, local people and refugees, while valuable assets like ivory and rhino horn may be used to fund the struggle.

He also demanded a signed affirmation from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the base could and would be successfully defended. For both men, the landmark French defeat \u2014 likewise a siege against a hilly outpost far to the north \u2014 hung over them heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t want any damn Dien Bien Phu,\u201d Johnson told his staff in 1967, while Westmoreland requested a thorough analysis of the 1954 battle \u201cto ascertain that we are taking all countering actions possible in relationship to the analogous Khe Sanh situation,\u201d according to a MACV memo. Khe Sanh likewise took hold of the American public, which bought into the notion of a pivotal battle that would leave one side sprawling and the other limping to final defeat.\n\nWestmoreland threw everything he could at Khe Sanh. During the 77-day siege, American jets flew more than 24,000 sorties, dropping 110,000 tons of bombs on the enemy positions. At one point, Westmoreland even considered the use of tactical nuclear weapons to defend the Marine garrison.\n\nBut Khe Sanh was only a prelude to an even bigger campaign: an all-out and unexpected assault on the more densely populated areas in the South, which, Hanoi hoped, would trigger a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government and the Americans. The attack, during the cease-fire for the lunar new year, known as Tet, involved close to 80,000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong fighters who had sneaked into nearly 100 hamlets, villages, cities and towns across South Vietnam.\n\nThough caught off guard, the Americans and their allies reacted quickly and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy force, an estimated 37,000 in the first few weeks of fighting (separate phases of the offensive, which ran into the summer, brought their losses above 100,000). But it came at great cost: The South Vietnamese lost 21,000 men; the Americans and other allies lost nearly 24,000; and tens of thousands of civilians were killed or wounded. A suicide squad of 19 Vietcong sappers breached the American Embassy grounds in Saigon \u2014 allegedly one of the most secure locations in South Vietnam. Many of the buildings in the ancient capital of Hue were totally razed during a monthlong battle, resulting in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of refugees.\n\nAmerican forces broke the siege of Khe Sanh in April 1968 but withdrew a few months later. Afterward, North Vietnamese forces moved into the area, unopposed, and held it until 1971.\n\nWas Westmoreland duped? Was the attack on the Marines at Khe Sanh simply a ruse to beguile the sclerotic Americans, and especially their obdurate leadership, into believing that Giap was attempting a repeat of the Dien Bien Phu victory? Or were they two separate campaigns? After all, Giap was skeptical of the Tet offensive and paid meticulous attention to Khe Sanh (and, conveniently, was sent to Hungary for medical treatment in the fall of 1967, as the planners behind Tet put the final touches on their offensive).\n\nDuped or not, Westmoreland was replaced soon after the Tet offensive ended. The well-respected CBS newsman Walter Cronkite \u2014 a former supporter of the war \u2014 now thought the best that the United States could hope for was a \u201cdraw.\u201d Johnson chose not to run for a second term as president, and Richard Nixon was elected that fall primarily because of his promise to end the fighting.

The younger generation who has money \u2014 they\u2019re not looking to shop the same way their grandparents did. They\u2019re looking to buy pre-owned, not new.\u201d\n\nThe Geneva-based independent watchmaker Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Journe came to the same conclusion in November 2016, when he announced the F.P. Journe Patrimoine service, allowing buyers to purchase timepieces from collections that are no longer in production. The brand restores the watches as new and sells them again, complete with a three-year warranty.\n\nThe British watchmaker Bremont experimented with a similar concept in May, when it teamed with the pre-owned watch e-tailer Crown & Caliber for what they called a first-of-its-kind pilot program. For a month, consumers could use the website to exchange any of their timepieces, regardless of brand, for cash or for a store credit at the Bremont boutique in New York.\n\n\u201cIt came about because a lot of people are trading our limited editions,\u201d said Giles English, co-founder of Bremont. \u201cIdeally, they\u2019d like to go into our boutique and buy a secondhand watch. So we talked to Crown & Caliber about formalizing something.\u201d\n\nAlthough the trial was a success, Mr. English said, it was just a test as the obstacles to a permanent secondhand business are considerable. \u201cEveryone is walking on eggshells because they don\u2019t want to upset their retail chain,\u201d he said.\n\nAn even thornier issue, especially for brands guilty of overproducing inventory, is resolving their watches\u2019 poor performance in secondary channels.\n\nAs Mr. Bacs said, \u201cThe absolute bitter truth is that some watches are selling above retail and some are selling at a fraction of retail \u2014 maybe 20 percent of the retail price \u2014 after five years. No manufacturer wants to tell that to its owner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe fact that for 20 years we have all talked about it and nobody has yet found a solution means it\u2019s tricky,\u201d he said of the secondary market. \u201cIf a brand gets it right in today\u2019s market, meaning they don\u2019t lose money, they have revolutionized the landscape.\u201d", "title": "Watch Brands Confront a Risky Business: The Secondhand Market", "authors": ["Victoria Gomelsky"]}

At the 2017 S.I.H.H., as the fair is best known, Audemars Piguet introduced its all-black, all-ceramic Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar ($93,900).\n\nResponse was so enthusiastic that one client in Monaco reportedly paid 25,000 euros ($30,130 today) to secure a higher place on the watch\u2019s wait list, said Chadi Nouri Gruber, the company\u2019s product director. \u201cBasically if you want one now,\u201d she said, \u201cthe resale value has gone up 20 percent to 25 percent on the original retail price.\u201d\n\nAt Geneva Days, the LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton exhibition that runs concurrently with S.I.H.H., Zenith is introducing its first all-ceramic watch, the Defy 21 El Primero Ceramic ($15,100)). And in November, Girard-Perregaux unveiled its Laureato Skeleton Ceramic, also with a black ceramic case and bracelet, exclusively for the United States market ($36,600).\n\n\u201cCeramic is a very important material for Girard-Perregaux,\u201d said Antonio Calce, chief executive of Sowind Group, which includes Girard-Perregaux. \u201cIts black surface is elegant and technical, harder than steel, and it keeps the same sophisticated look when the surface is polished or brushed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor William Massena, managing director of the online forum TimeZone, ceramic\u2019s popularity among consumers is driven primarily by its scratch-resistant qualities, which mean a watch can still look good years after purchase. \u201cWhen you buy a watch, you hate your first scratches,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also reflects the appeal among certain connoisseurs, he said, for materials originally developed for aerospace and other high-tech industries that have been applied to watches by Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet and others. These materials \u201care now \u2018recycled\u2019 in high-end watch manufacturing with much success,\u201d Mr. Massena said, with ceramic having the added advantage of being less expensive than materials like graphene and forged carbon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to its marketing allure and resistance to wear, ceramic offers welcome aesthetic opportunities. \u201cIt gives watchmakers a whole avenue of creativity,\u201d Ms. Schnipper said.\n\nIt is an effective solution to the continued interest in all-black watches, for example. Unlike coatings on metal, the color in ceramic is a property of the material itself and thus resists fading and wear. Dr. Brunner said, \u201cIf you want a very dark or black watch that is durable, ceramic is the only option.\u201d\n\nIt also opens the door to a range of other colors. At S.I.H.H., Audemars Piguet is marking the 25th anniversary of the Royal Oak Offshore model by expanding its ceramic palette, adding khaki, blue and gray to different components, including bezels and pushpieces.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe development of colored ceramics in watchmaking has been relatively slow, however. \u201cAny time you add color, it can affect the solidity of the piece,\u201d said Richard Mille, the avant-garde watchmaker who has created ceramic watches in a variety of colors.\n\nFor him, the watch fair is an opportunity to unveil his latest exercise in the material, the RM 07-01 Black Ceramic (price not yet available), which the brand said is the first ceramic watch to be set with diamonds.\n\nThat is no mean feat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process to develop this watch,\u201d Mr. Mille said, noting he had to find a way to make the holes needed to set the diamonds without compromising the case\u2019s strength. \u201cYou have to be careful not to weaken the ceramic.\u201d\n\nThe material\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel?: It can be brittle. If dropped from a certain height, a ceramic piece can fracture on hitting the floor. But Mr. Massena is not troubled. \u201cCeramic is one of the oldest exotic materials, and unlike some, it has aged very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think its durability should be a concern.\u201d\n\nAlso, production costs are expensive. As ceramic has different tolerances, the same technical drawings cannot be used for a ceramic watch as a metal one. \u201cYou have to redesign every single link, more or less,\u201d Dr. Brunner said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe all-ceramic Royal Oak, for example, required more than 600 hours of research and development \u2014 but the result is true to the brand. \u201cMany watchmakers adapt their product to the ceramic materials, meaning simple construction, rounded angles, polished finishes without contrasts,\u201d Ms. Gruber said. \u201cWe did exactly the opposite. We adapted the ceramic to our codes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIWC hopes to avoid ceramic\u2019s shortcomings by combining it with titanium. Ceratanium, its new patented titanium alloy, is the answer, Dr. Brunner said. \u201cIt gives the low brittleness of titanium and the hardness of ceramic.\u201d\n\nThe first application of Ceratanium was the Aquatimer Ceratanium ($46,800), issued in September to mark the 50th anniversary of its signature diver\u2019s watch.\n\nWhen exposed to high temperatures, the new alloy creates a diffusion layer of ceramic that becomes integrated with the layer below, making the material extremely resistant to chipping and wear. \u201cThe hard crust developed on a loaf of bread in the oven is very similar to the ceramic layer formed in the Ceratanium process,\u201d Dr. Brunner said.\n\nCeratanium is more adaptable than ceramic. \u201cYou can take the technical drawings for a standard metal bracelet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a very big advantage in terms of time and cost.\u201d\n\nAs for ceramic, Mr. Massena warned against its being used as just a marketing gimmick for watches. \u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s overused,\u201d he said, with many brands jumping on the ceramic bandwagon following the success of Rado, IWC and Chanel\u2019s J12.\n\nOverall, he said, it is best applied to specific components, such as bezels, that benefit from its resistance to scratches and discoloration. Either way, ceramic should be approached with care, Dr. Brunner said.\n\n\u201cYou need a team in the company who really understands ceramics and knows how to avoid its pitfalls.\u201d", "title": "Watchmaking\u2019s New Favorite?

Under his pillow at night he had, alongside his dagger, a copy of the \u201cIliad.\u201d His literary GPS, we understand. As important as the epic\u2019s originally oral story of great conquest was the script it was written in: That too would conquer worlds. This review is printed in a variant of it.\n\nThe narrative gallops on to Mesopotamia, Nineveh, clay tablets, cuneiform and Gilgamesh. Puchner explains it all with brio. By Page 50 Ashurbanipal is a name the reader will feel able to drop knowingly into any conversation on literary matters.\n\nIn chronological procession there follow Buddha, Confucius (a notably brilliant chapter), \u201cThe Tale of Genji\u201d (hooray, at last, for the woman author), the Mayas (a dark episode), the Gospels, Gutenberg, Muhammad, Luther, Cervantes, Goethe, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Marx and Engels, the African epic of Sunjata \u2014 on, on and on to Derek Walcott (\u201cnew nations need stories to tell them who they are,\u201d writes Puchner) and Harry Potter (\u201crepetitive,\u201d alas).\n\nThe invention and spread of paper gave literature wings. So too did print and in our day, the web. Looking at his screen, Puchner wonders what foundational texts will flicker down to us.\n\nThere is a joyous personality in this book. Puchner gives more of himself to the reader than most literary historians. As a child, he confides, he was entranced by the \u201cArabian Nights\u201d \u2014 only cliff-hanging bedtime stories to her husband can save Scheherazade from being a one-night queen and next morning\u2019s bridal corpse. But who originated this bundle of tales? The question nags at Puchner. He has a dream that he describes at length. What does the dream tell him? Stop looking. Searching is futile.\n\nPuchner describes himself, modestly, as a \u201cteacher\u201d (so, of course, did Confucius). In fact he occupies an endowed chair at Harvard. But he doesn\u2019t sit on it. Fieldwork for \u201cThe Written World\u201d takes him to every continent, digging inexhaustibly into cultures for their foundational and sacred stories. Martin Puchner\u2019s score on RateMyProfessors.com must be sky-high. I suspect he is as enlightening at the lectern as on the page. But is he right? One thinks uneasily of other foundational texts \u2014 \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Mao\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d \u201cThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u201d \u2014 that have exercised anything but a civilizing force. It would be nice to discuss such things with this brilliant scholar. Or dutifully listen \u2014 like Confucius\u2019s pupils.\n\nPhoto\n\nAbigail Williams works on a smaller scale than Puchner, although she too concerns herself with how books condition readers and their society. Her preferred method is the illustrative vignette. It makes for a lively survey. Her book, \u201cThe Social Life of Books,\u201d appears as part of a series covering the history and culture of the so-called \u201clong 18th century\u201d in England. Her principal interest is the middle-class home \u2014 \u201ca semipublic reception space\u201d as she calls it, in a rare lapse into jargon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe is enlightening, to take one example, when it comes to light, on how domestic candlepower (at a period when wax candles were expensive, and tallow candles nasally offensive) framed the 18th-century reading experience.\n\nSamuel Johnson, one recalls, a ferociously unsociable reader, and blind as a bat, was constantly in danger of singeing his wig against his candle. Like the single, often feeble source of visual light, the fire in a room on a cold night created an intimate circle, as eager for bodily warmth as entertainment or instruction. As Schopenhauer said, even porcupines cluster together when it\u2019s chilly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Books remained, however, prohibitively expensive and scarce. Library and cheap reprint systems had yet to evolve.\n\nThose factors created a drive toward what Williams calls, with her favorite epithet, \u201csociable\u201d consumption. Books were necessarily read aloud to a group. The single copies were typically acquired in quires (sheets) and bound by their owners (invariably male) defining them as personal property, something certified by a pompous \u201cex libris\u201d bookplate. Books had an aura of hierarchy and patriarchy: the parson in his pulpit, the politician at the dispatch box, the professor on the podium, paterfamilias in his armchair.\n\nCodes of secular decency were promulgated by Joseph Addison in his universally popular \u201ctea table\u201d essays: short and in themselves decent enough for an evening\u2019s listening by mixed male, female and younger audiences. Shakespeare was rigorously clipped, so as not to bring blushes to maiden cheeks.\n\nAs any audiotape demonstrates, reading aloud is slow. \u201cEpitomes\u201d and \u201cextract\u201d volumes \u2014 especially of verse \u2014 were popular. Walter Scott, as a child, was famous for his thrilling infant recitations to groups of admiring adults. As the twig was bent, so the tree was formed. The Wizard of the North never stopped thrilling.\n\nSociable reading encouraged a premium on elocution. Sociable reading improved the English tongue. And the English pen. Correspondence became more fluent and stylistic over the century. There were virtuosos in the form, like Horace Walpole. (Williams\u2019s book is in a series named after Walpole.) The manuscript diary and personal, commonplace book flourished. Williams has read dozens of them to make her points.\n\nSociable literacy took a variety of household forms.\n\nWomen embroidered poetic maxims into samplers while listening. Recipe books in the kitchen improved the food on the table. Pages from the almanac hung on the kitchen wall reminded the mistress of the household of holy days and holidays. \u201cServants\u2019 libraries\u201d endeavored to instill moral standards in the lower classes. The drawing room globe was the most instructional furniture in the house \u2014 invaluable during a reading aloud of \u201cRobinson Crusoe.\u201d In its little, domestic world, writing civilized the middle-class home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWilliams avoids Jane Austen, on the reasonable ground that a lot has already been done on her. The author of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d wrote privately, covering up her manuscript if anyone came near. She read her finished work to a family audience. What would one not give to be among them?\n\nThe rise of the novel tilted the practice of reading toward private and speedier consumption \u2014 but not entirely. Samuel Richardson clearly expected his books to be sometimes read out loud slowly \u2014 in a male voice, often, even though the woman\u2019s letter was his narrative vehicle. Bedroom reading is, Williams reminds us, very different from reading in the drawing room, or on public transport (the stage coach, at this period).\n\nWilliams\u2019s book is welcome because her research and insights make us conscious of how we, today, use books.

Mr. Obama made this obvious when he announced in 2009 that American troops would start withdrawing and handing off the war to Afghan forces in 2011. Pakistan\u2019s generals, led then by the Army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, a former director of the spy agency, privately told American and NATO military leaders that they would fail. \u201cGiven the number of troops you have and the time constraints, you won\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d General Kayani said, according to a participant in the meeting.\n\nHe meant that the American-led effort against the Taliban would not be decisive and that Afghan forces would never cohere enough to win. General Kayani wanted a less ambitious plan aimed at clearing radicals out of the Afghan-Pakistan border. Considering Inter-Services Intelligence\u2019s role in the conflict, however, his prediction of American failure could be heard as much as a threat as a forecast. Pakistan\u2019s objective has been to prevent Afghanistan\u2019s violence from spilling over its border and to prevent India from gaining influence in a neighboring country.\n\nApart from the convoluted policies of the United States, there are other reasons the Pakistani spy agency\u2019s approach has prevailed despite American frustration and periodic threats. Because keeping Pakistan\u2019s nuclear bombs out of the wrong hands has long been a top priority for the United States and Europe, it follows that Pakistan\u2019s overall stability is crucial. Yet the more violent the Afghan war became after 2001, the more it destabilized Pakistan.\n\nAfter Al Qaeda took refuge in Pakistan, it collaborated with local radicals. Starting in 2007, those networks turned against the Pakistani state and touched off the worst years of domestic terrorism Pakistan has ever known. Suicide and car bombings rocked major cities, and tens of thousands of Pakistani civilians, security personnel and insurgents died. The country has paid a steep price for Inter-Services Intelligence\u2019s coddling of groups like the Taliban for decades.\n\nOnly since 2016 has Pakistan somewhat restored domestic security; last year was the least deadly since 2005, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a research project, yet more than 500 Pakistani civilians perished in terrorist attacks.\n\nThe thinking of the United States and the European governments has been consistent, if rarely enunciated in public: To keep Pakistan stable and its nuclear arms under control, there is a limit to how much outside pressure can be brought to bear on the country.\n\nPresident Obama authorized the C.I.A. to attack Al Qaeda with armed drones in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas along the Afghan border. And of course, Mr. Obama authorized a daring SEAL raid inside Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden, without asking permission. But the larger terrorist infrastructure \u2014 the Afghan Taliban\u2019s leadership and many other violent groups nurtured and tolerated by Inter-Services Intelligence \u2014 remains unscathed, operating from Lahore to Karachi to Quetta to Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.", "title": "Opinion | We Can\u2019t Win in Afghanistan Because We Don\u2019t Know Why We\u2019re There", "authors": []}

Our political polarization hampers our ability to tackle important national issues, whether immigration, infrastructure, timely budgeting or closing Guant\u00e1namo. The recent government shutdown and the looming threat of another underscore this problem.\n\nThe same policy stagnation afflicts our ability to confront the most pressing threats to our security, from North Korea to the risk of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction, from pandemic disease to Russian aggression. Our ability to counter such outside menaces is increasingly undermined by our collective failure to work together. Indeed, the most significant, long-term threat to our security may be our domestic political polarization.\n\nAmerica\u2019s adversaries exploit the vulnerability created by our dysfunctional democracy. Today, in contrast to Sept. 11, a terrorist attack is more likely to divide than unite us, as we saw after Benghazi, San Bernardino, Calif., and, most recently, Niger. This makes us an even more attractive target, as our enemies benefit not only from the initial attack but also from the lasting consequences of a more fractious, fragmented America.\n\nSimilarly, the Iranians know that our resolve to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon may crumble under partisan pressure.

Beyond the dirty bits, the books I read described the moments before and after the main event, the stuff you don\u2019t see in mainstream movies, where zippers don\u2019t get stuck and teeth don\u2019t bump when you\u2019re kissing; the stuff you don\u2019t see in porn, where almost no time elapses between the repair guy\u2019s arrival and the start of activities that do not involve the clogged kitchen sink.\n\nObjectification doesn\u2019t exist just in porn, of course. \u201cSo many men cannot get their heads around the idea that women are not first and foremost sexual objects,\u201d the novelist Jenny Crusie told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that from porn; you get that from a persistent worldview modeled by the men around you that you\u2019ve been taught to admire.\u201d\n\nI have no idea how much, if any, X-rated material Mr. Ansari or his date consumes. Statistically, we know that modern men and women have access to every kind of explicit material, literally in their pockets.

And a 400-page novel can teach you more about them than any X-rated clip. Fiction has time to draw a deeper picture, covering the getting-to-know-you stuff, the starts and stops and circling back that take boy and girl from first date to first kiss to the moment where they\u2019re both naked and hopefully into what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\n\u201cRomance novels teach readers that all partners are equal participants in a sexual relationship,\u201d said Bea Koch, the 28-year-old co-owner (with her 25-year-old sister, Leah) of the Ripped Bodice, a bookstore in Culver City, Calif., that exclusively sells romance titles. \u201cThey highlight conversations about consent, birth control and myriad other topics that people generally find difficult to talk about. In some instances, it can be a literal script for how to bring up difficult topics with a partner. They give a road map to people wanting to experiment with their sexuality, or even just get in touch with what they want and need in a sexual relationship.\u201d\n\nPorn, necessarily, cuts to the chase: a little less conversation, a little more action.\n\nTalking\u2019s not sexy, people complain.\n\nBut when you don\u2019t know how to ask, when you can\u2019t bring yourself to tell, when you don\u2019t possess the language with which to talk about desire, that\u2019s when you can end up with crossed wires, missed signals, mixed messages, a guy who goes to sleep thinking, \u201cThat was fun!\u201d and a girl who goes home crying in an Uber.\n\nIf we want men and women equally empowered to form real connections, to talk, honestly and openly about who they are and what they want, there are worse places to start than curling up with a good book.", "title": "Opinion | We Need Bodice-Ripper Sex Ed", "authors": []}

Perhaps President Trump understood this when he proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities last year.\n\nThe history of Latino diaspora art in Los Angeles shows that even small, local works can produce big cultural shifts. In the 1970s, a group of Los Angeles artists at the barrio gallery Self-Help Graphics wanted their community to celebrate the beauty of Mexican culture. So they worked to recreate Mexican \u201cD\u00eda de los Muertos\u201d (Day of the Dead) traditions in Los Angeles, starting with events in East Los Angeles parking lots.\n\n\u201cEveryone was trying to discover their roots, who they were,\u201d the artist Linda Vallejo told me last fall at a retrospective on the gallery\u2019s four decades of D\u00eda de los Muertos work. Those artists helped make Day of the Dead, with its marigolds and sugar skulls, the newest addition to the pantheon of American ethnic holidays.\n\nThis normalization of Latino and immigrant culture is an essential act in the Trump era, a time when I\u2019ve heard stories about white school kids yelling \u201cTrump!\u201d at their brown-skinned classmates as if it were a slur meant to remind them of their inherently second-class status. Resisting the spread of hatred requires all sorts of actions. Go to a march, call your representative \u2014 but also bring a great work of literature by an immigrant writer to your book club and support arts education everywhere.\n\nWhen we feel powerless to stop the hatred and injustice directed at our people, we should remember art\u2019s potential to enlighten the uninformed and to slowly eat away at prejudice.\n\nThis has happened before in the United States. In the early decades of the last century, during the depths of Jim Crow, with its lynchings and de jure segregation, the Harlem Renaissance was born. It was a cultural prelude to a civil rights movement that changed the very notion of what American identity is.\n\nI feel a renaissance coming. I see it in the discipline and ambition of our young people. They eat Oaxacan mole and Korean kimchi, and they read, joke and create in Spanish, Amharic, Creole and Arabic.

{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "In Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide Realty Investors has constructed the 75-acre, $1 billion Arena District, with an N.H.L. arena (home to the Blue Jackets), surrounded by 1,030 apartments, 2 million square feet of commercial space for 80 businesses, a minor-league baseball stadium, restaurants and stores. In Cincinnati, the Banks, a new $1 billion mixed-used district, has emerged on the Ohio River shoreline between the city\u2019s baseball and football stadiums. In Inglewood, Calif., a $3.8 billion, 298-acre mixed-use development currently under construction will include a privately financed N.F.L. stadium to be shared by the Los Angeles Rams and the newly located Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nAnd in Detroit, the $863-million, 19,500-seat Little Caesar\u2019s Arena, home to both the Pistons and the Red Wings, opened last summer in amid the 50-block District Detroit, a $1.2 billion mixed-use neighborhood.\n\nThe explosion in mixed-use developments like these is owed, in part, to the urban American economic renaissance. City populations grew faster from 2010 to 2016 than those in the suburbs, reversing a 60-year trend that started in 1950, according to census data. And cities \u2014 not suburbs \u2014 are the now primary generators of the nation\u2019s economic growth, according to research compiled by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one-square-mile effect,\u201d said Bruce Katz, an urban development specialist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cDowntowns and midtowns possess an enormous amount of value in a relatively small geography.\u201d\n\nStrong-Arming Local Governments\n\nFor years, owners used their team\u2019s popularity or perceived economic importance to strong-arm government officials. In many cases, owners threatened to move their teams if governments did not build them new stadiums along with the roads and public utilities needed to operate them.\n\nA 2016 study by the Brookings Institution found that 45 stadiums and arenas for the four major professional sports \u2014 football, baseball, basketball, hockey \u2014 were constructed or renovated in the United States from 2000 to 2014 at a cost of nearly $28 billion. Of that, $13 billion was publicly financed with tax-exempt bonds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut previous projects that foundered, particularly in the 1990s, point up the potential risk of these investments. \u201cWhat was at work in those deals was the idea that a large public subsidy for a stand-alone facility would keep the team in place and would stimulate economic activity,\u201d said Roger Noll, emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University. \u201cThe financial catastrophes that occurred convinced cities and residents that multimillion-dollar subsidies for stand-alone stadiums are a loser.\u201d\n\nExamples of that are legion, particularly for N.F.L. stadiums. In the early 1990s, St. Louis city and county, and the state of Missouri, spent $258 million to build a 70,000-seat domed stadium downtown to attract an NFL team. The city lured the Rams, who played in the stadium from 1995 to 2015 before moving back to Los Angeles. The city, county and state still have $140 million in debt, and millions more in annual maintenance costs to pay until the debt service is completed \u2014 on an empty stadium \u2014 at the end of 2021.\n\nUrban design specialists also raised their voices in opposition to the old model. They noted that generous public-stadium financing ignored almost every facet of sound real estate development, like location. America was producing a generation of isolated arenas in the suburbs and countryside, ringed by giant parking lots, many of which sat empty much of the year.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat certainly characterized Detroit\u2019s comparatively brief experience with suburban sports stadiums. In 1975, the NFL Lions moved from the nine-acre, 63-year-old Tigers Stadium in Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood to the $55.7 million Silver Dome in Pontiac, which was surrounded by over 100 acres of surface parking near the center of the struggling Oakland County city. The team stayed until 2002, when it returned to Ford Field, a $500 million stadium alongside the two-year-old $300 million Comerica Park, the baseball Tiger\u2019s new home on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit. Both stadiums were partially financed with taxpayer dollars.\n\nLast year, Little Caesars Arena opened across the avenue, completing a strategic development vision, developed by business and civic leaders in the 1990s, that focused on professional sports as a catalyst for Detroit\u2019s revival. The NBA Pistons play in the new arena after spending the previous 29 seasons in The Palace of Auburn Hills, a 22,000-seat arena in a prosperous suburb 33 miles north of downtown Detroit that opened in 1988.\n\nThe Palace held its last event in September and is scheduled for demolition. Its 109-acre site, most of it surface parking, is being rezoned as a campus for high tech business and research.\n\nA Role Model in Kansas City\n\nIf there is particularly good model for what\u2019s happening in Sacramento, it can probably be found in Kansas City and the city\u2019s Power and Light District. The $1 billion, 12-block district features a 150,000-square-foot covered plaza, more than 50 restaurants and taverns and hundreds of market-rate apartments. It opened in 2007 next to the city\u2019s publicly financed $263 million, 18,500-seat Sprint Center, which, though it does not host a professional team, has been frequently used as a site for college basketball games, including regional rounds of the annual NCAA tournament.\n\nA decade later, the Power and Light District, developed by the Cordish Companies \u2014 whose chief executive, David Cordish, is credited with being a leader in sports-focused mixed-use development \u2014 is cited by city officials as the primary reason that a 2.5-mile, $102 million downtown streetcar line in the city center started in 2016. Thousands of new apartments opened, the downtown population increased to 30,000 from 8,000, and city tax revenue soared.\n\nPhoto\n\nTroy Schulte, city manager of Kansas City, explained how the project was initially seen as a risk but eventually remade his city and its finances. \u201cI was budget director at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the guy saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know if this is going to pay for itself.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe transition from empty parcels to crowded streets was swift. H & R Block opened its 17-story, 531,000 square foot headquarters in the neighborhood in 2006.\n\nA year later, the arena opened and so did a 150,000-square-foot KC Live! entertainment plaza across the street. Office workers strolled the sidewalks by day. Thousands more rolled into town for dinner and drinks before concerts and games, and stayed afterward to party.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Schulte and his colleagues have been criticized for a consultant\u2019s overly enthusiastic estimate that the district would generate sufficient tax revenue to service the bond debt, which is $17 million this year. The district produces $6 million in revenue from taxes on property, sales, earnings and utilities.\n\n\u201cThat debt was issued with almost no safety cushion,\u201d a former city councilman, Dan Cofran, told The Kansas City Star in 2015. \u201cIt was reckless.\u201d Mr. Cofran said the project should have been smaller and constructed in stages.\n\nMr. Schulte disagrees. He said the city tried to finance the development with a dedicated sales tax, which was rejected in a referendum. Depleted at its center and stranded in an era of sluggish growth, the city pursued what he said was the next best option \u2014 selling municipal bonds paid for with revenue from a special taxing district.\n\nKansas City\u2019s tax base now raises $8 billion annually, with $2 billion from downtown activity. Before the Power and Light District opened, the city\u2019s tax base was $5 billion with $1 billion from downtown. There are now 40,000 downtown jobs, twice as many as a decade ago.\n\nMr. Schulte acknowledges that although tax revenue from the district is steadily increasing, it is not clear that enough will be generated to cover the debt service. \u201cBut from the perspective of economic development and economic resurgence,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the best $300 million we\u2019ve ever spent.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nKeeping the Kings in Sacramento\n\nSacramento\u2019s downtown was ready for a makeover back in 2013, when Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 met with Mayor Kevin Johnson to consider a pitch by David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner, to buy the Kings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA growing city of about 480,000, and the hub of a seven-county metropolitan region with 2.4 million residents, Sacramento struggled for years to replace the home of the Kings, the 17,300-seat Sleep Train Arena, the smallest in the N.B.A. and which the team had played in since 1988.\n\nVarious proposals to build a new arena in the same area, publicly financed with sales tax or other public sources were floated and then sunk, two times by failed ballot measures. As the venue aged and the Kings consistently lost more games than they won, the owners, the Maloof brothers, sought to sell the team. A buyer\u2019s group from Seattle, which lost its own N.B.A. team to Oklahoma City in 2008, was interested. But city officials were determined to keep the team \u2014 and Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9, who had become a Silicon Valley billionaire with the software company he founded, was a prime recruit to help make that happen.\n\nMr. Ranadiv\u00e9 had earlier parlayed the success of his company, TIBCO Software, into a role as vice chairman and co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, lending him credibility with Mr. Stern and Mr. Johnson, who himself had been an N.B.A. all-star during the 1990s.\n\nMr. Johnson had also become a fan of Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9\u2019s story, described in a 2009 New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell. In 1973, when he was 16, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 emigrated from India and arrived in the United States with $50 in his pocket. A graduate of M.I.T. and Harvard, in 1985 he founded a company that enabled investors and traders to instantly collect and analyze large amounts of data in real time.\n\nAs part of the pitch, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 and Mr. Johnson toured a decrepit downtown mall that would be replaced with a new arena for the Kings. The mayor proposed spending $255 million, essentially a long-term loan, to construct the $560 million facility.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Ranadiv\u00e9 would be expected to pay the balance, plus 65 percent of the city\u2019s investment through a 35-year lease agreement and property taxes. When all was said and done, Sacramento\u2019s investment in an arena that it would own would be $86.7 million.\n\nThe proposal departed from almost every previous arena-financing deal. Arena-construction packages that relied on public investments typically featured taxpayers paying all, or nearly all of the development costs without ever being paid back.\n\nWould Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 bite?\n\nHe did. Visiting downtown Sacramento that day, he said, he envisioned crowds on the sidewalks, and in the space occupied by the near-empty 42-year-old mall, he saw a plaza surrounded by a state-of-the art arena, hotel, offices, restaurants and stores. And he sensed opportunity in a city desperate to keep its N.B.A. franchise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn May 2013, as the principal investor, Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 bought the Kings for $534 million, at the time the highest price paid for an N.B.A. franchise up to that date. (It\u2019s since been eclipsed by the $2.2 billion paid last September for the Houston Rockets.) In buying the Kings, and agreeing to pay for more than half the new arena, he hoped to leverage his knowledge in technology, sports, information, and design to not only gain control of a sports franchise, but to revive what he considered an important American city.\n\nThough Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 has turned out be a somewhat polarizing figure among fans of the Kings, the project itself has since unleashed more than $1 billion more in new construction and redevelopment in surrounding blocks. And just north of the city center and Downtown Commons, on the site of the Sacramento\u2019s former 244-acre Union Pacific rail yard, a local development group broke ground in the summer on a second sports-focused, mixed-use neighborhood anchored by a privately financed, $245 million, 20,000-seat outdoor major league soccer stadium.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, I said no other city is going to steal our team,\u201d Mr. Ranadiv\u00e9 said. \u201cThe Kings are the heart and soul of the city.\u201d", "title": "Welcome to the Neighborhood: America\u2019s Sports Stadiums Are Moving Downtown", "authors": ["Keith Schneider"]}

An analysis of nearly 500 accounts from 12- to 18-year-old girls about their negative experiences with sexting found that over two-thirds had been asked for explicit images. The majority described facing intense pressure that often began with promises of affection and discretion in exchange for \u201cnudes,\u201d before accelerating to \u201cpersistent requests, anger displays, harassment and threats.\u201d The study drew from comments posted between 2010 and 2016 on A Thin Line, MTV\u2019s campaign against sexting, cyber bullying and digital dating abuse. As one research participant explained about being pressured by her boyfriend, with the shorthand and spelling errors of a texting teenager: my bf preaused me for hours to send him pictures of me naked. Now he threarens to send them out if i dont send hin more really nasty pics. The stuff i have to do is unbelievable. im 14. Other research has found that while both boys and girls send naked images, boys are nearly four times as likely to pressure girls to send sexts as girls are to pressure boys to do so. In the wider culture, it appears we have suddenly come to the limit of our tolerance for the sexualized abuse of power by adult men. A logical next step is to recalibrate some of the toxic norms that have taken hold among teenagers. Most schools and many parents already tell teenagers not to send sexualized selfies. But why don\u2019t we also tell adolescents to stop asking for nude photos from one another?\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\n\n\u2014 To what extent do the experiences with sexting described by teenagers in the article resemble your own experiences?

Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back.

Can we muster the wherewithal to master the difficulties that life typically tosses at us, sometimes at an early age, or are we sitting ducks apt to crumble with every disagreeable word that blows, especially across a college campus near you? Into this combat zone steps the psychologist Meg Jay with her second book, \u201cSupernormal: The Untold Story of Adversity and Resilience.\u201d\n\nWith much passion, her earlier book, \u201cThe Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter \u2014 And How to Make the Most of Them,\u201d revealed the private quandaries of millennials seeking her out for psychotherapy and exposing a very different side of themselves than their public posts on Facebook.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "Dirty air has been seen as the unavoidable byproduct of economic growth ever since the coal-stoked advent of the industrial age. The soot-stained \u201cfogs\u201d of 19th-century London seemed to bring about, as Charles Dickens wrote, \u201cthe death of the sun.\u201d The perpetual smoke that enveloped Pittsburgh, the musclebound center of American industrial power, reminded one 19th-century writer of \u201chell with the lid taken off.\u201d Back then, residents of these industrial capitals had little idea about the dangers of inhaling soot and smog. Indeed, many Londoners took pride in their \u201cpea soup\u201d as a symbol of progress and prosperity.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has been the embodiment of the city besieged by air pollution, an economic juggernaut with episodes of smog so extreme that they have earned their own sobriquet: \u201cairpocalypse.\u201d Now the mantle passes to India. In the past two years, Delhi has had only eight days when pollution levels have met W.H.O. safety standards, according to Usman Nasim, a researcher at the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment. And Delhi is probably not the most polluted city in India. Recent data suggest that four other Indian cities have higher average levels of PM2.5, microscopic airborne particulates that are especially harmful to humans.\n\nThe old logic about pollution \u2014 that it is the price of progress \u2014 has shifted, even in the developing world. Tackling air pollution in countries still dependent on coal (as both China and India are) takes an abundance of political will \u2014 and money. Shutting down dirty factories, cleaning up industry and shifting toward renewable energy can initially drive up costs and impede growth. But researchers are finding that pollution can be an even bigger drag on growth over the long term. It not only damages a country\u2019s image and hurts its ability to attract talent, tourists and investors; air pollution also exacts heavy losses in health expenditures, labor losses, agricultural activity and premature deaths. (The W.H.O. estimates that air pollution causes close to a million deaths per year in both India and China.) Over all, the World Bank estimates that air pollution already drains at least $55 billion worth of labor output alone from the Indian economy every year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch economic tidings, environmentalists hope, will push India to finally rise above its fractious politics and fragile institutions to tackle endemic pollution. The signs, however, are not all promising. India\u2019s former environment minister himself dismissed what he called a \u201cmisleading\u201d W.H.O. report that listed more than 30 Indian cities among the world\u2019s 100 most polluted \u2014 and rejected another scientific study linking air pollution to mortality.\n\nPhoto\n\nLooking at how India and China deal with pollution crises raises the question of which type of government might get better results: democratic or authoritarian? Even in India, environmentalists marvel at China\u2019s ability to mobilize its bureaucratic machinery. But the reality is messier. China\u2019s pollution crisis, which grew out of its three-decade pursuit of economic growth at all costs, festered in a closed one-party system that suppresses information and public opinion. It was considered almost revolutionary in 2012 when the U.S. Embassy, defying Beijing, continued to share real-time pollution data online from its own air-quality monitor. My family lived in Beijing for four years, at a time when every winter morning was a roll of the dice: crisp blue skies or apocalyptic smog-scape. My sons knew that if they could not see the building across from us, 100 yards away, school would be canceled. For them, a smog day was just like a snow day, only spent indoors \u2014 next to the air purifiers.\n\nHow, then, did China suddenly declare its \u201cwar on pollution\u201d in 2014? There were factors beyond the poisonous smog: a slowing economy, a crippling coal addiction, a fed-up middle class clamoring for better quality of life. Above all, it was economics. China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection estimated that pollution in 2010 cost the economy around $227 billion, or roughly 3.5 percent of G.D.P. Despite resistance from industry and local governments \u2014 China is not a monolith, after all \u2014 the country has shut down coal-burning factories, doubled down on renewable energy, created a dense grid of air-monitoring stations and exposed thousands of officials for violating environmental laws. This is all good, but so far, much of the effort has focused on the region around China\u2019s showcase city, Beijing.\n\nIn Delhi, the government submitted a new antipollution plan days after the cricket incident. \u201cIn the end, the question always is: Will it be implemented, or will it only be the blame game again?\u201d Nasim says. An emergency plan drawn up after heavy pollution in late 2016 went largely unused during the recent crisis. \u201cThe same cycle happens every year,\u201d says Michael Brauer, a professor of environmental health at the University of British Columbia. \u201cAt some point, Delhi will have to address air pollution as a chronic problem requiring long-term solutions, not just a seasonal event.\u201d\n\nPollution will still plague Asia\u2019s two largest capitals for years to come. When Delhi\u2019s worst smog subsided this winter, The Times of India ran the headline: \u201cAir Quality Very Poor \u2014 and It\u2019s Good News.\u201d Beijing, for its part, rang in 2018 with another bout of hazardous smog. My family and I left that city three years ago for Shanghai, where the air, though still dirty, was better for our children\u2019s lungs.

It also involves analgesia, the prevention of pain; anxiolysis, the relief of anxiety; and amnesia, the obliteration of memory. The latter is necessary because it is by no means certain that patients are fully unconscious when anesthetized \u2014 a problem explored at length in Kate Cole-Adams\u2019s book \u201cAnesthesia.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite the central role that anesthetic drugs play in medicine, very little about how they work is known for certain. Equally remarkable is the fact that ether, the first agent to be used as a general anesthetic, was shown by Paracelsus in the 16th century to put chickens to sleep. He wrote that it \u201cquiets all suffering without any harm and relieves all pain\u2026\u201d It remains mysterious as to why 300 years were to pass before it came to be used as a general anesthetic. Some would point to Kuhn\u2019s scientific paradigms and argue that medicine wasn\u2019t ready for such a shift in thinking, others that it reflects the entirely unscientific nature of premodern medicine and the blinkered self-confidence of doctors. There are, of course, many similar examples in the history of medicine \u2014 perhaps the most egregious being the failure of the medical profession to exploit Leeuwenhoek\u2019s invention in the 17th century of the microscope and his discovery of microbial life, as discussed in David Wootton\u2019s book \u201cBad Medicine.\u201d\n\nSeveral American doctors began to use ether as a general anesthetic in the 1840s. There were bitter disputes about who could claim to be the first, but what is clear is that ether was rapidly taken up by the medical profession. It is interesting to note that it was also widely used as a recreational drug in countries like Ireland and Poland, where it was used as an alternative to alcohol.\n\nEther is no longer used in general anesthesia, and has been replaced by different \u201cvolatile\u201d agents \u2014 such as sevoflurane and isoflurane. The way in which these volatile anesthetic agents dissolve in oil led to the theory that they worked by interfering with the lipoprotein membranes of nerve cells, implying that all the brain\u2019s neurons were inactivated by the drugs and that the unconsciousness of general anesthesia was complete. This theory is no longer believed and instead there is near-complete uncertainty as to how the agents do work. More recent research on injectable anesthetic drugs like propofol suggests that they interfere selectively with certain neurotransmitters and with the interaction between the cerebral cortex (where thought and perception resides) and the deep part of the cerebral hemispheres known as the thalamus, which acts as some kind of gateway between the cerebral cortex and the rest of the brain. In other words, it is by no means certain that all of your brain is \u201casleep\u201d when you are anesthetized.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Awareness became a clinical problem in the 1940s with the introduction of the paralyzing drug curare. Until then, if an anesthetic was inadequate, the patient would start to wake up and to move. With curare this cannot happen and it is possible for patients to be awake and, since they are entirely paralyzed, for the anesthesiologist to be unaware of it.\n\nAwareness undoubtedly can occur under anesthesia although there is much argument as to how often. A 2014 survey in the United Kingdom of three million cases of anesthesia suggested an incidence of 1 in 19,000 with not all the episodes causing distress. This survey relied on patients volunteering their memory of being aware, so it is possible that some chose not to report the experience and that the true incidence might be higher. The issue is further complicated by the possibility of implicit or \u201cunconscious\u201d memory as opposed to conscious or \u201cexplicit\u201d memory. The \u201cexplicit\u201d memories would be the horror stories of patients wide-awake but unable to move while being operated on, usually as a result of medical error. It seems that the paralysis is even more distressing than the pain and can lead to long-term psychiatric harm and PTSD. Implicit, unconscious memories of being awake under anesthesia are much harder to uncover.\n\nCole-Adams makes much of these sorts of hidden memories in her book, and of various experiments with hypnotizing patients before and after anesthesia to find them, but as she admits, the evidence is confused and contradictory. Nevertheless, some anesthesiologists are careful in what they say in front of anesthetized patients in case the patient is able to later recall what they overheard. This is quite unlike surgeons who, on the whole, are disinhibited extroverts when operating.\n\nA good experience of anesthesia should be as routine and dull as a commercial airplane ride, with the added feature that the patient should have no memory of it. Both anesthesia and flight have become dramatically safer in recent decades and there is much in common between flying an aircraft and anesthetizing a patient \u2014 uneventful most of the time but occasionally terrifying and very occasionally fatal. The Patient Safety movement of recent years has been largely driven by anesthesiologists and analogies to aviation safety, which perhaps apply less well to surgery.\n\nIt is difficult to write an exciting book about modern anesthesia but Przybylo is thoughtful and workmanlike in his production, as he is, it is quite clear, when administering his anesthetics. Consciousness is an entirely subjective phenomenon and, perhaps inevitably given its subtitle, you will learn as much, if not more, about Cole-Adams\u2019s own anxieties and preoccupations as you will about anesthesia in her book. The effect, as she streams her consciousness over many pages, can in itself be somewhat anesthetic.", "title": "What Happens When You Go Under", "authors": ["Henry Marsh"]}

But instead the fever swamp stuff helped hand the G.O.P. to Trump himself, and the birther\u2019s grip-and-grin with an uncomfortable Romney was a small but notable milestone on that path.\n\nThe larger, indirect role that Romney played in Trump\u2019s ascent was in the way he ran and lost in 2012. There were times when the Man From Bain Capital seemed to have some sense of the populist discontents that Trump successfully played upon four years later. Romney\u2019s rhetoric on China and immigration was a more restrained version of Trump\u2019s nationalist pitch, and here and there he tried to imitate Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s promise, updated crudely by Trump, to be a traitor to his successful class.\n\nBut not nearly often enough. Instead, the defining pitch of the Romney campaign was the tone-deaf \u201cyou built that,\u201d which valorized entrepreneurs and ignored ordinary workers; the defining policy blueprint was a tax reform proposal that offered little or nothing to the middle class; and the defining gaffe was the famous \u201c47 percent\u201d line, in which Romney succumbed, before an audience of Richie Riches, to the Ayn Randian temptation to write off struggling Americans as losers.\n\nAs a result, whether in his father\u2019s Michigan, in his running mate\u2019s Wisconsin, or in Pennsylvania where he campaigned hopefully near the end, downscale white voters who could have gone Republican either voted for Obama or stayed home. And in that failure lay the opportunity that Trump intuited \u2014 for a Republican candidate who would rhetorically reject and even run against the kind of corporation-first conservatism that Romney seemed to embody and embrace.\n\nSince taking office, of course, Trump has mostly turned his back on his own economic populism \u2014 and lost much of his modest-to-begin-with popularity in the process. But in that time, the men who imagine themselves the party\u2019s stewards or its conscience have learned little from the way he beat them and then beat the Democrats. They are still suffering from what Pete Spiliakos, in a withering column for First Things last month, called \u201cThe Romney Disease\u201d \u2014 a condition that combines admirable personal probity and decency with an abiding commitment to unpopular economic policies:\n\nThe best of the current Republicans (the Paul Ryans, the Ben Sasses, the Mitt Romneys) have certain common features that should be appealing to the electorate. They seem to have the home life of the family man. They have the discipline and diligence of the organization kid. They have the looks of the pretty boy. Yet the public still rejects them, because the voters find their ideas even more unpleasant than Donald Trump\u2019s odious personality.\n\nIf Romney joins the Utah Senate race, and ultimately the Senate, there will be a lot of talk about the service he can perform for his country by resisting the worst of Trumpism. But he could also perform a service by showing that he has learned something from watching Trumpism succeed where his own campaign failed \u2014 which would mean steering a different and more populist course than those NeverTrump Republicans who pine for a party of the purest libertarianism, and those OkayFineTrump Republicans who are happy now that Trump has given them their corporate tax cut.", "title": "Opinion | What Has Mitt Romney Learned?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Last week, a group of Russian aviation students unleashed a firestorm when a decidedly homoerotic video of them dancing to the 2002 electro hit \u201cSatisfaction\u201d found its way onto YouTube.

The Russian students aren\u2019t the first to be inspired to make their own version: In 2013, for instance, British military personnel made a parody in which they, too, wore almost nothing and danced erotically while cleaning their living quarters.\n\nThe Russian clip resembles the British version: It follows a gyrating, nearly naked cadet up the stairs of a dormitory building where the camera floats through various spaces typical of post-Soviet communal interiors. He encounters other young men dancing suggestively while engaged in household chores. In one scene, a cadet comes out of a bathroom stall and playfully tilts his peaked cap.

Think of the Yankees, propelled by a Bucky Dent homer, eliminating Boston at Fenway Park in 1978. But if we limit this to the 96 division series in baseball history, we find one-third (32) that have gone the full five games.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe finality of Diggs\u2019s catch (let\u2019s forget the kneel-down on the extra-point attempt) means the baseball precedent would have to be a game-ending play. Because of the structure of baseball, with the home team batting last, that means this happens only when the home team wins. Somewhat surprisingly, the home team has won just 13 of those 32 Game 5s.\n\nNow our pool gets a lot smaller. How many of those 13 games ended on so-called walk-off plays? Just three: the 1995 series between the Yankees and the Seattle Mariners; the 2001 series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks; and the 2011 series between the Diamondbacks and the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut here\u2019s an added wrinkle. When Case Keenum found Diggs for the winning touchdown, the Vikings were losing. In 2001, when Tony Womack singled to win it for Arizona, and in 2011, when Nyjer Morgan singled to win it for Milwaukee, the games were tied.\n\nThat brings us to 1995, at the Kingdome in Seattle. As the Yankees\u2019 Jack McDowell delivered the final pitch of that game, the Mariners were losing, 5-4. By the time the play was over, the Mariners had won. Edgar Martinez ripped a double into the left-field corner, scoring Joey Cora with the tying run and Ken Griffey Jr. with the winning run. The Yankees went home and the Mariners rolled into the American League Championship Series.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSeems like a match, doesn\u2019t it? Yet it\u2019s not quite perfect. There were no outs when Martinez connected, so the game would have continued if he had made an out. Likewise, when the New York Giants\u2019 Bobby Thomson homered to vanquish the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1951 \u2014 the fabled \u201cShot Heard \u2019Round the World\u201d \u2014 there was one out, not two.\n\nThat homer comes pretty close, though, as the Giants also went from losing to winning on the final play. It sent the Giants to the World Series, so there was more at stake than there was in Minnesota on Sunday.\n\nHere\u2019s another that almost works: Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series in Atlanta. It\u2019s the wrong round, of course, but everything else lines up. The Pittsburgh Pirates were winning, 2-1, with two outs and two on when Francisco Cabrera stepped up against Stan Belinda. If Cabrera had made an out, the Braves would have been eliminated. Instead, he singled in both runners to win the pennant.\n\nElimination game? Yes. Winning to losing on the final play? Yes. Game over if Cabrera fails? Yes. Just one round too late. There\u2019s even a bonus connection: both moments were aided by a defensive blunder. In 1992, the tying run reached base on an error by Jose Lind. On Sunday, Marcus Williams missed the tackle on Diggs.\n\nI could be missing a similar situation from generations past. If so, please let me know. In any case, it\u2019s fun to think about, and it\u2019s one way to unite baseball, football and basketball. In those sports, unlike hockey or soccer, you can go from losing to winning on the final play \u2014 an exquisite kind of euphoria for the winner and torture for the loser.\n\nAnd while I can\u2019t precisely match the Diggs catch to baseball, one precedent absolutely works. As my pal Gar Ryness, better known as Batting Stance Guy, pointed out on Twitter, we had seen another player wearing No. 14 catching the final ball of a postseason victory in a domed stadium in Minnesota.\n\nIndeed, when the Twins won their first championship, in Game 7 of the 1987 World Series at the Metrodome, the final out nestled in the glove of the big first baseman Kent Hrbek. He wore No. 14, just like Diggs at the same site more than three decades later.", "title": "What Is Baseball\u2019s Equivalent of the Vikings\u2019 Miraculous Victory?", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner", "On Baseball"]}

By definition, the barometric pressure must drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours for a storm to be called a bomb cyclone; the formation of such a storm is called bombogenesis.\n\nHere is how it works: Deep drops in barometric pressure occur when a region of warm air meets one of cold air. The air starts to move, and the rotation of the earth creates a cyclonic effect. The direction is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (when viewed from above), leading to winds that come out of the northeast \u2014 a Nor\u2019easter.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened at the end of October, when warm air from the remnants of a tropical cyclone over the Atlantic collided with a cold front coming from the Midwest.

{"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "text": "One explanation for all this is that the acceleration of information flow has heightened our impatience with not knowing. Until the internet\u2019s arrival, the \u201cjour,\u201d or day, was the primary unit of time by which journalism functioned. But now that the minute, or better, the second, is the new unit of preference, it might be more fitting to change the profession\u2019s name to minutalism or secondalism. In the attempt to capture an event just as it happens, or even before it does, the news becomes less factual and more hypothetical. The absurdity of the word \u201ctomorrowism\u201d might just match the absurdity of the phenomenon.\n\nAnother theory is offered by Richard Grusin in his excellent book \u201cPremediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11,\u201d in which he describes the ways in which the media in all its iterations tries to buffer itself against a repetition of the shock that was Sept 11. In response to an event that caught everyone off guard and left the nation steeped in residual trauma, premediation allows for the sustainment of a constant, baseline fear by keeping catastrophe always within peripheral view. This is accomplished in part by creating a media apparatus into which any future event might be plugged, offering us the illusion of preparedness. Hurricanes, nuclear wars, stock market plunges, epidemics, terror attacks, earthquakes and currency collapses: The headlines prepare us for all of these by rehearsing them in advance.\n\nMr. Grusin writes: \u201cPremediation is not about getting the future right, but about proliferating multiple remediations of the future both to maintain a low level of fear in the present and to prevent a recurrence of the kind of tremendous media shock that the United States and much of the networked world experienced on 9/11.\u201d Mediatic readiness \u2014 and anticipation \u2014 has become necessity.\n\nI believe something similar is going on in response to Trump trauma. Despite efforts to remain poised for all of the world\u2019s contingencies through the process of premediation Mr. Grusin describes, many of us were startled by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The media, which seems to be repenting for having misread or misrepresented polls that showed a sure Hillary Clinton win, now atones by constantly hedging \u2014 offering us a tree of all possible outcomes and a range of fairly noncommittal speculations that can be backed away from if their conjectures prove false.\n\nThis leads us to a third possible reason speculative journalism thrives today: its mitigation of risk. What the speculative journalist has in common with the gamblers of Las Vegas and Wall Street is the willingness to take risks, but the stakes in this game are relatively low. When the future materializes, there will certainly be winners and losers. Someone will have gotten it right, and this certainty reassures us somehow. But given the superabundance of speculations clouding the mediascape, will anyone remember or care exactly who got it wrong? Those who were right will trumpet their prophetic insight and ascend as soothsayers; those who were wrong will simply keep quiet.

So do his generosity and loyalty as a critic and friend (to Eliot, Joyce and others), his tirelessness as a teacher, his unorthodox brilliance as a translator from multiple languages and above all, his supreme ambition for poetry, expressed in his long poem the \u201cCantos,\u201d and in its animating conviction that poetry not only could but should guide the practical motions of society itself.\n\nOn the other hand, Pound was a sort of Antaeus. As long as his feet were on the ground that fed him with images and experiences, he was a giant. In the air, as a seer, a social theorist and a philosopher, he was notoriously vulnerable. He worshiped strong leaders; he indulged in a virulent anti-Semitism; and only slyly, belatedly, offhandedly did he take responsibility for mistaken actions and for detestable opinions that he expressed in writing. His life resists posterity\u2019s best efforts to make it resemble a morality play. His arrogance, his ambition and his hopes for his country led him to record more than 100 radio broadcasts critical of the American government while he was in Mussolini\u2019s Italy between 1941 and 1943. Indicted on a charge of treason during the war, he was eventually declared of unsound mind and spent almost 13 years confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital outside Washington, D.C. Upon arriving at Naples, Italy, in 1958 after his release, his first gesture was the Fascist salute. Yeats foresaw all of this when he met the young Pound in 1912: \u201cHe is a headlong ragged nature, is always hurting people\u2019s feelings, but he has I think some genius and great good will.\u201d\n\nThe latest contribution to the Pound conundrum is Daniel Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Bughouse: The Poetry, Politics and Madness of Ezra Pound.\u201d Swift is not a literary scholar. Instead, he is a kind of literary-critical memoirist. His approach is to provide new insights into poetry by reconstructing the environment in which poems were written, incorporating his own experience into the text. His book \u201cBomber County\u201d (2010) examined some poetry of World War II through an exploration of a relative\u2019s service in the Royal Air Force. Now he seeks insights into Pound through biographical investigations of those who visited him over the years at St. Elizabeths and through other extramural research. Swift declares, \u201cWherever people speak of Pound, there I tried to go.\u201d His strategy is intriguing but prone (as is memoir itself) to a kind of irrelevant narcissism. Declaring that previous biographies have sought to provide too unified a portrait of Pound, Swift suggests that he will \u201cpermit rival tellings to sing their discord\u201d through a \u201cstyle of telling \u2014 occasional, fragmented, in glimpses\u201d not unlike the collage effect of Pound\u2019s own poems.\n\nSwift has done a certain amount of detective work here, though no doubt not enough to satisfy the Poundians, who are a fierce and demanding tribe. The names on those cartes de visite to St. Elizabeths constitute a roll call of major American poets: John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, T. S. Eliot, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, W. S. Merwin, Charles Olson, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Louis Zukofsky and others. Swift reveals himself to be no deep student of American poetry, and he is occasionally given to unhelpful generalities, as when he declares that \u201ctragedy, modernism, translation, collage: All are concerned with the great action of drawing together.\u201d He reads the work of Pound\u2019s visitors and those works of poetry, translation and prose that Pound created during his confinement. It is hard to identify Swift\u2019s final judgment of the poetry; he declares that \u201cthe grand bad faith of the \u2018Cantos\u2019 \u2014 its pomposity, its anger \u2014 is a constant, running line after line,\u201d but this is so instantly untrue that one wants to chalk it up to the spiteful impatience every reader has felt who has engaged deeply with Pound\u2019s allusive and polyphonic poem and emerged occasionally inspired but also baffled and frustrated. Swift\u2019s most useful discovery may be the extent to which Pound at St. Elizabeths became a kind of touchstone by which other poets \u2014 beginning with Olson, but including Lowell and Pound\u2019s old friend Williams \u2014 sought \u201cto take Pound in, incorporate him, shape him\u201d for themselves. Captivity invites appropriation, and appropriation can take different forms, as for example when Eliot protectively sought to shape the perception of Pound in the world at large as a cold high modernist, rather than as an intemperate propagandist.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy focusing on a nexus of relationships leading to and from Pound at St. Elizabeths, Swift also illuminates what he rather grandly calls \u201cthe riddle at the heart of the 20th century.\u201d The genius is a madman; the savior is a betrayer; the populist is an aristocrat; the intellectual and artistic hero is a coward and a faker; the innovator is a reactionary; the artist is a politician; the legislator is an inmate. The contradictions multiply until they seem to describe something larger than any one man. Swift quotes the literary scholar Samuel Hynes in 1955 to the effect that Pound\u2019s confinement is \u201ca reflection of an apparently insoluble modern dilemma, of the way in which individual freedom and the common good have come to be seen as antithetical.\u201d This is by way of saying that when we indict Pound, we indict ourselves and our society.\n\nUnfortunately, this argument goes only so far. Swift also quotes Williams in 1947 declaring that Pound \u201chas lost faith in the efficacy of the poem and gone over to ideas, using poetry as his stick.\u201d Here is the ultimate tragedy: that the attention to crystalline detail, in Pound\u2019s poems, to the particulars on which life and truth depend, should be sacrificed to his desire to be, as Gertrude Stein famously remarked, the village explainer. Nor does Williams\u2019s \u201cstick\u201d ignore the darker consequences of Pound\u2019s skewed beliefs, which have, as Swift shows, fed a range of conspiracy theorists and white supremacists as well as the movement known as CasaPound in Italy. And yet, and yet: Apparently Pound, in one of his late notebooks, asked, \u201cHave I seen the divine where it is not?\u201d And no reader of Pound\u2019s lyrics, his translations or sections of his \u201cCantos\u201d could respond in the negative. Pound saw the divine, and he helped us see it too. Is he discounted as a seer, then \u2014 or supremely validated as one? Not a poet himself, Swift nonetheless understands poets when he writes, \u201cWhat is moving and important is the attempt and not the achievement.\u201d And he quotes Olson, the first poet to visit Pound in St. Elizabeths, who asks, \u201cShall we learn from his line and not answer his life?\u201d One longs for deliverance from the contradictions, but there is none. As Swift remarks: \u201cSome parts we keep and some we send away. It is by choosing between the two that we get to glory.\u201d", "title": "What Life in Confinement Meant for Ezra Pound\u2019s Work", "authors": ["Karl Kirchwey", "Daniel Swift"]}

That\u2019s because, just as the check arrived, HQ beckoned: The live trivia app had announced a surprise game, and if I wanted a shot at answering 12 multiple-choice questions and vying for a share of the $18,000 pot, I had to tap in instantly. For the next 15 minutes, I was not exactly human. I was a slave to HQ. HQ blasted out of obscurity this fall to become the best worst thing on the internet. It\u2019s the most popular app that barely even works. The questions (\u201cHow many times does the word \u2018sex\u2019 appear in the U.S. Constitution?\u201d) can be so obscure as to be meaningless, and the wording (\u201cWhat is the more common plural form for octopus?\u201d) is frequently indecipherable. (The hugely controversial \u201ccorrect\u201d answer: octopuses.) Some questions (\u201cWhich retro fashion style did NOT make a comeback this year?\u201d) basically test opinions. Others, which mine inconsequential information about obscure start-ups, stink strongly of advertorials. Then there\u2019s the app itself, which is riddled with glitches and lags. Players are regularly booted from the game without explanation. The live host\u2019s face is frequently obscured by the wheel of death. Sometimes, the whole game is scrapped for mysterious technical reasons \u2014 including one high-stakes game scheduled for 11:45 p.m. EST on New Year\u2019s Eve, which was unceremoniously aborted, then rescheduled for 45 minutes later \u2014 the game I hopped into.

Is it the cash prize? The feelings of intellectual superiority and being aggrieved it fosters? The entertaining host? The sense of community it creates among players? Or a combination of all of the above?\n\n\u2014 Are there other apps or games you like to play that involve the elements that make HQ Trivia so appealing to such a wide audience?

Many studies have shown that immigrants commit crimes at far lower rates than native-born Americans, and experts say the evidence doesn\u2019t support any claim that undocumented immigrants commit a disproportionate amount of crime. But Mr. Trump again on Tuesday raised the specter of an immigrant crime rampage. He\u2019s right that the gang MS-13 is a terrible scourge; he was deeply wrong to suggest it was somehow representative of immigration\u2019s effects on the nation.\n\nDigging in on his maximalist demands for limiting legal immigration and dividing immigrant families, Mr. Trump said he would bring the immigration system into the 21st century. He\u2019s actually trying to drag it back to a shameful, bigoted past.\n\nIn the campaign, Mr. Trump promised a new kind of politics, a populist administration that would end corruption in the capital, crack down on Wall Street and deliver for Middle America.

Washington is more paralyzed than ever by partisanship, and as for corruption \u2014 well, lobbyists can now do their deals in the bar of the Trump International Hotel.\n\nHow, then, can we say with Donald Trump as president that the state of the union is strong? Here, Mr. Trump deserves much of the credit: So far, the reaction against his authoritarian impulses, assault on truth and cruelties great and petty has revealed abiding American strengths. Despite the strong economy, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of this presidency. Most Americans say immigrants strengthen the country, according to the Pew Research Center. A profound national reckoning is underway over the status and treatment of women. Voters have streamed to the polls in off-year elections, defying suppression efforts even in Alabama to register their revulsion at Trumpian politics.\n\nAs a national party, the Democrats have yet to find a coherent, appealing voice with which to do more than rail against Mr. Trump and instead address the nation\u2019s needs. But as Republican members of Congress, in disgust or despair, choose not to run again, first-time candidates, many of them women, are stepping forward at the grass roots across the United States.\n\nIf not exactly \u201cwoke,\u201d this country might certainly be described as awakening, with a shot at shedding the civic apathy that has afflicted it for far too long. It is with backhanded gratitude that we might all thank President Trump for that.", "title": "Opinion | What Trump Doesn\u2019t Get About the State of the Union", "authors": []}

So while 20 percent of American babies are exclusively breast-fed for the first six months of life, the figure is 42 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Rwanda, it\u2019s a stunning 87 percent.\n\n6. African governments have conscientiously followed recommendations of the World Health Assembly to curb infant formula marketing that discourages breast-feeding; the U.S. has not. In this respect, suggests Shawn Baker of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, \u201cThe U.S. might benefit from technical assistance from Botswana.\u201d\n\n7.

At a time when much of the rich world has turned against refugees, Uganda has quietly accepted more than one million South Sudan refugees.

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "More than a decade ago, I was coming off a successful summer stint as a Wall Street Journal reporting intern. Naturally, I vied with other interns for a full-time reporting job. A post came up in the Hong Kong bureau. Did I, a Cantonese speaker with prior Asian reporting experience, get it? I wasn\u2019t even asked to apply. Instead, a fellow intern with no prior Asia experience was hired. He was white.\n\nLater, the Journal offered me a part-time reporting job in Hong Kong, which I took to get a foot in the door. But it was a struggle to achieve pay parity from such a lowly start, even after winning awards and a shared Pulitzer. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for a 70 percent pay raise! That\u2019s never been given before,\u201d I heard from an editor during salary negotiations. How hilarious, I thought at the time, that The Journal should expect its reporters to understand the financial intricacies of large corporations while swallowing this kind of flimflam. But the joke was on us.\n\nLast year, the Independent Association of Publishers\u2019 Employees reported a persistent wage gap between men and women employed by Dow Jones, The Journal\u2019s parent company. The report found that full-time female employees make on average less than 85 percent of what their male counterparts earn, even when accounting for differences in age and location. And there is a distinct and persistent gap between pay for men and for women, even when they hold the same job title and have worked the same amount of time. Dow Jones female employees in New York \u2014 hardly a cheap place to live \u2014 made $10,000 less than their male counterparts, and $13,000 less in Washington. Multiply that difference over the span of a career and that\u2019s the home you can never buy, or several children\u2019s college educations.\n\nNone of this is, of course, unique to media: The gender pay gap is an unfortunate feature of many industries, from banking to Hollywood to even female-dominated industries, such as cleaning and teaching. But this particular pay gap affects our crucial understanding of China\u2019s rise, one of the biggest news stories of our time.\n\nForeign correspondents of Carrie Gracie\u2019s caliber, who are fluent in the language and have several decades of experience, are rare. Spanning 10 years, her stories on a rural farming community\u2019s transformation into a huge city is one of the definitive narratives of China\u2019s urbanization process. Foreign correspondents of her caliber who are women, who have spent their careers underpaid and faced challenges their male peers never had to, are rarer still. While there\u2019s no accurate data comparing the numbers of male and female foreign correspondents, it\u2019s quite likely that the figures mirror or surpass those of general newsrooms, which are two-thirds male. Such imbalances are certainly reflected in journalism prizes, as Pulitzers for international reporting and even the Martha Gellhorn Prize \u2014 named for a female correspondent \u2014 go overwhelmingly to men.", "title": "Opinion | What We Lose When We Lose Female Reporters", "authors": []}

(Manager, Mother Jones)\n\nCorporate profits are shrinking. What gives?\n\nThe tax overhaul signed into law last month is muddying the fourth-quarter earnings picture.\n\nImproving corporate profit have been a pillar of the current rally, and analysts have forecast robust earnings growth in the coming months as the global economy gained momentum.\n\nYet with 11 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported four-quarter results, profits have slipped 0.2 percent from a year ago. That\u2019s well below the 10 percent analysts expected ahead of earnings season.\n\nSo what gives? The tax law.\n\nLarge financial firms, which have made up the bulk of companies reporting thus far, have taken big one-time, tax-related charges. Profits for financial firms in the S&P 500 fell $29.2 billion, or 57 percent. Citigroup accounted for 73 percent of that decline. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, writes:\n\n\u201cPrior to the earnings release, many analysts had not updated their EPS estimates to reflect the impact of the charge. However, since the majority of analysts covering Citigroup provide EPS estimates to FactSet on a GAAP basis, the tax charge was included in the actual EPS for comparison.\u201d\n\nExclude Citi, and the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 would improve to 7.9 percent from -0.2 percent.\n\nTwo points of note:\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhile some of the biggest banks are reporting fourth-quarter earnings hits stemming from the new tax law, they see rich benefits over the long term, including effective tax rates that are even lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate,\u201d as NYT\u2019s Jim Tankersley reported last week.\n\n\u2022 As the fourth-quarter earnings growth rate has fallen over the last week for S&P 500 companies, profit expectations for 2018 have risen.\n\nPhoto\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t certain it\u2019s good for democracy\n\nHere\u2019s what Samidh Chakrabarti, a product manager at the tech giant, wrote in a post on the company\u2019s Hard Questions blog:\n\nFacebook was originally designed to connect friends and family \u2014 and it has excelled at that. But as unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it\u2019s being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.\n\nMr. Chakrabarti added that while the company was slow to address Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s working to prevent it happening again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore news from Facebook\n\n\u2022 It spooked some publishers again by saying it would let users rank the trustworthiness of news outlets.

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "Alas, her career mostly predated the era when film and TV routinely came to international opera houses. We have some wonderful films of Callas in concert. And there is an amazing video of her in Act II of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca\u201d in 1964.\n\nBut no full operas by one of the greatest singing actresses in history; this hologram performance can seem to fill in a bit of that gap. The operatic voice, and the art form itself, can feel so fragile. What better way to represent that fragility \u2014 while also reviving it, in a kind of s\u00e9ance \u2014 than a hologram?\n\nThe respected stage director Stephen Wadsworth, with a distinguished record in opera and theater (including a production of Terrence McNally\u2019s \u201cMaster Class,\u201d about Callas), is the creative director for this \u201cCallas in Concert.\u201d In introductory comments, Mr. Wadsworth said that the project has tried to present Callas with \u201crestraint, subtlety and delicacy.\u201d The notion of a singing hologram might seem incompatible with such a goal. Yet moments during Sunday\u2019s preview were surprisingly affecting.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the \u201cHabanera\u201d from \u201cCarmen,\u201d this Callas sang the Act III scene in which Carmen reads her fortune in some cards and sees death foretold for herself and her lover. In the recording that was used, Callas\u2019s singing was chillingly subtle and sad. In the hall, however, the sound was a little spotty, at times tinny (the producers say they are still tweaking the technology).\n\nAt the end of the excerpt, the holographic Callas tossed Carmen\u2019s cards into the air above her, where they hovered in space for a moment before slowly drifting down, an effect that allowed the conductor time to segue seamlessly into the next aria, from \u201cMacbeth.\u201d Though a melodramatic touch, it worked. If you\u2019re going to use hologram technology, then it makes sense to go all out and create something new, rather than just copy a standard concert.\n\nThere were several stretches during Lady Macbeth\u2019s sleepwalking scene that got to me, mostly because the real Callas\u2019s singing on the recording was so honest and revealing. At her best, Callas redefined what it meant to sing beautifully. Her deeply emotional, sometimes delicate, sometimes frayed singing of the Verdi aria was the essence of truth, something that cut through all the holographic stage tricks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut what is the point of this spectacle? Who is the intended audience? Callas, a symbol of chic, remains an object of fascination extending even beyond opera fans. Perhaps the hologram will introduce some newcomers to her incredible artistry; I\u2019d urge everyone to listen to Callas\u2019s extensive discography. Like so many now, I loved her without ever seeing her live; this holographic specter was weirdly tantalizing, even if it hardly made up for that.\n\nThe problem, as it always has been in opera fandom, will be if this specter from the past prevents a full appreciation of the vitality of opera and singing today. Lovers of opera, more than probably any other art form, have always been too quick to complain that the \u201cgolden age\u201d has long since left us, and have preferred to sit at home with their records rather than seek out young performers and live, necessarily imperfect performances.\n\nRather than recommend that fledgling operagoers hear Callas\u2019s hologram, I\u2019d tell them to get to the Metropolitan Opera, where Sonya Yoncheva and Anna Netrebko singing \u201cTosca\u201d this season will tell them much more about what makes opera so endlessly exciting.", "title": "What a Hologram of Maria Callas Can Teach Us About Opera", "authors": ["Anthony Tommasini"]}

I understand why someone would give in to the persistent demands of a child she loved, but the child\u2019s mere curiosity probably wasn\u2019t a good-enough reason to break the covenant.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But this isn\u2019t something she\u2019s entitled to, which means that you\u2019re entitled to decline. It would be an act of generosity, given your feelings, to meet with her again yourself. You shouldn\u2019t let her try to impose a relationship on the children you have raised, however. That decision is up to them.\n\nI\u2019m a European working in a central African country. A friend of mine (a native of that country) told me that his youngest sister was raped by his brother-in-law. He decided quickly to get him arrested. While the offender was still in detention, a huge family conflict arose. The wife of the offender, my friend\u2019s older sister, who has children, as well as his mother, argued that the case should not proceed to court. They wanted to free the offender before the community could spread the news. They feared that the family\u2019s honor would be damaged, and the victim would never find a husband (as most men here would never marry a victim of rape). My friend told me that even the victim decided to forgive the offender so that the community would never know, and she would have a chance to marry one day. But given the family pressure, I wonder if their quick pardon was genuine. I wonder if there might have been a solution to this situation, in which the victim would receive justice and still have the chance to marry one day. Name Withheld\n\nHonor codes are often brutal for victims of rape. This was true in many parts of Europe until very recently as well. In Pietro Germi\u2019s brilliant and disturbing 1964 film, \u201cSeduced and Abandoned,\u201d a man is required to stage the abduction and violation of a 16-year-old girl, who is already pregnant with his child, so that they can get married in a way that will preserve her honor and protect him from the charge of corrupting a minor. In their Sicilian community, the honor of the girl\u2019s family can be preserved only if she marries the man who has \u201cdefiled\u201d her. (And marrying a rapist is more honorable than having a child outside of marriage.) Until 1981, in fact, Article 544 of the Italian criminal code recognized a kind of marriage \u2014 the matrimonio riparatore \u2014 that \u201crepaired\u201d the wrong done by rape, even of a minor. In marrying his victim, the rapist was restoring her family\u2019s honor. Not much concern there for her feelings or interests.\n\nIn such cultures, a rape victim has a strong incentive not to press charges, however much she might believe that justice requires it. She can\u2019t have justice without becoming unmarriageable, and perhaps rendering her siblings unmarriageable as well. Unless, that is, there are decent men around who can see the wrong here. In Italy, the 1965 case that helped lead to the repeal of Article 544 involved the rape of a Sicilian teenager, Franca Viola, who refused a matrimonio riparatore and defied social codes by insisting on the prosecution of her rapist. It helped that she had a boyfriend she knew would marry her anyway and a father who was willing to accept that the family would be regarded as dishonored by most of their neighbors. Your friend\u2019s sister wasn\u2019t so lucky. And the only solution is a social movement that will reform the honor code to make it consistent with one simple moral insight: The sole person whom rape shames is the rapist. Forty years after her rape, Franca Viola told an interviewer that her advice, when faced with an important decision, was \u201cto follow always your own heart.\u201d She\u2019s a hero of mine because she makes that sound far easier than it is.", "title": "What if I Don\u2019t Want to See the Child I Gave Up for Adoption?", "authors": ["Kwame Anthony Appiah", "The Ethicist"]}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "In my opinion, she has a hoarding disorder and the beginnings of dementia, and she has had problems maintaining her apartment to the landlord\u2019s satisfaction. She also has trouble dealing with documents, paying bills and scammers. She never became a Canadian citizen, and her Canadian and American identification have both expired so she can no longer travel.\n\nI am in my 70s and live hundreds of miles away in the United States. I have a husband, an adult child and grandchildren, for whom I provide a lot of child care. My sister is behind my other family in my priorities, and frankly she drives my husband and me crazy. I am not willing to relocate to Canada or have her live with my husband and me.\n\nShe has refused to give me power of attorney so that I can deal with financial institutions when she has been scammed or has neglected to pay bills. For some time, she refused to admit that she has any \u201cmemory problems\u201d or to consult her doctor. She does not want anyone messing around in her business.\n\nI see her a few days each year, during which I try to touch base with the last of her friends, do some cleaning and decluttering, have some fun with her and yes, nag her to make some changes. If she continues to refuse help, may I be excused from feeling guilty?\n\nName Withheld\n\nBeing excused by me isn\u2019t likely to stop you from feeling guilty. You seem to have done all that you could reasonably be expected to do at this point. The trouble is that your sister is likely to cross the border into incompetence, where the balance shifts as to what your relationship demands. For now, you must respect her autonomy; once she reaches a certain stage, caring for her may involve ignoring her expressed wishes.\n\nEarly-onset dementia, a concern faced by our previous writer, poses one set of complications. But dementia among the elderly poses a broad social burden simply because it\u2019s so common. By 2030, all the baby boomers will be 65 or older. Last year, in Canada, the number of seniors (ages 65 or older) for the first time exceeded the number of children (14 or younger). If your sister\u2019s dementia advances, as is likely, and if she has the resources to be cared for in a residential facility (or to receive in-home care), you might want to hire a lawyer in Canada to help you manage her affairs and establish her legal identity.\n\nIf your sister received permanent residency in Canada, there are procedures for replacing an expired permanent-resident card. If she\u2019s in Canada against the law, you\u2019ll want a copy of her U.S. birth certificate, because Canada will have the right to send her back to the United States. Once she regularizes her documents, the authorities might let her back in, but if she was in a condition in which she needed frequent attention, it might be better if she were near you. The laws governing who can get certified copies of birth certificates vary by state. But as a sibling, you will generally be in a better position than a stranger. With the certificate in hand, you would be able to present it to United States consular officials in Canada in order to get her settled in a home in the United States. If she doesn\u2019t have the necessary savings, she could be eligible for Medicaid as a citizen.\n\nI\u2019ve gone into the weeds a little bit to make the point that taking over when your sister can\u2019t care for herself would be a major commitment. But no one else is in a position to do this, and as her sibling, you do owe her what philosophers call \u201cspecial obligations.\u201d Some people would like to think that such special obligations are binding only if they are voluntary. That\u2019s not the case. Your sister, ornery as she may be, has someone she can expect to help her when she can\u2019t help herself any longer.

{"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "text": "Research has shown that, in some cases, visual platforms can be good for us. One study, published by researchers at the University of Oregon in 2016, found that the use of image-based platforms like Instagram and Snapchat was associated with lower levels of loneliness among users, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction, while text-based platforms had no correlation with improved mental health.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA heavily visual platform also makes a relatively poor conduit for breaking news and in-the-moment commentary, which might explain why Instagram often feels less exhausting than other social networks. (It also explains why last month, before I went on vacation, I deleted every social media app from my phone except Instagram \u2014 the only app I trusted not to ruin my beachside calm.)\n\nLesson No. 2: Rethink the share button.\n\nOne of Instagram\u2019s most underrated virtues is that it has imposed structural limits on virality \u2014 the ability of a given post to spread beyond its intended audience. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, on Instagram there is no native sharing function, meaning that the reach of most Instagram posts is capped at the number of people who follow the user\u2019s account. (There are ways to \u201cregram\u201d someone else\u2019s photo using a third-party app, but they\u2019re clunky, and relatively few people use them. Instagram also recently began showing users posts from people they don\u2019t follow, a Facebook-inspired change that I\u2019d argue is a mistake.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nA native share button has been tremendously useful for Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth. It has also allowed upstart media organizations like BuzzFeed and Upworthy to build enormous audiences by specializing in highly shareable stories. But ease of sharing has also allowed the loudest and most emotional voices to be rewarded with clicks \u2014 and attention. It\u2019s this incentive structure that has allowed partisans and profiteers to hijack Facebook\u2019s algorithms and spread divisive messages and false news to millions of people.\n\nThe easy virality of Facebook also seems to have made individual users more hesitant about opening up. That makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s easier to share a selfie if you know it won\u2019t accidentally find its way into the feeds of a million strangers.\n\nLesson No. 3: Ban links.\n\nInstagram\u2019s greatest structural advantage, though, may be a result of its decision to go mostly link-free. Links in Instagram captions and comments aren\u2019t clickable, and while some users have found workarounds, the vast majority of Instagram posts aren\u2019t meant to send users to outside websites. (The exceptions are ads, which can contain clickable links and are, not coincidentally, the most troubled part of Instagram\u2019s platform.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe walled-garden nature of Instagram has frustrated publishers, who want to send followers out to their websites, where the publishers can earn advertising money and \u201ccontrol the reader experience.\u201d (It\u2019s really just about the money.) But Instagram has wisely refused to give in, perhaps realizing that allowing links might turn the platform into a screeching bazaar, with publishers and pages all doing circus acts for clicks.\n\nRemoving links from Facebook would wreak havoc on the digital media industry, which has built an economic model around referral traffic from Facebook. It would also risk alienating some users, who enjoy promoting and discussing stories from other parts of the internet. But it would also solve some of the platform\u2019s most vexing challenges. And ultimately, it would be better for the world.\n\nAfter all, malicious actors don\u2019t post fabricated news, wildly exaggerated headlines or partisan outrage-bait on Facebook only for fun. They do it, in many cases, because it\u2019s profitable. Take away bad actors\u2019 incentives and they\u2019ll go elsewhere.\n\nBanning most links doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Instagram as a business. It had more than 800 million monthly active users as of September, and it gained a million new advertisers last year. Facebook doesn\u2019t break out Instagram\u2019s revenue, but some analysts expect the app could one day generate as much as $10 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s still nowhere near Facebook, which earned $10 billion in revenue last quarter alone, but it\u2019s a meaningful number, and it shows that insularity isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLesson No. 4: Bad actors are unavoidable, but their influence can be contained.\n\nInstagram is far from a perfect social network, and copying it wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight. Among other issues, some research has shown that use of Instagram can breed insecurity and bullying, and exacerbate body image issues, especially among young women.\n\nInstagram also hosts its own sketchy microeconomy \u2014 just witness the scourge of Insta-celebrities endorsing dubious health products, or the uptick in fly-by-night consumer brands that market themselves using Instagram ads.", "title": "What if a Healthier Facebook Is Just \u2026 Instagram?", "authors": ["Kevin Roose", "The Shift"]}

First, by melting some leeks in a pan with some butter and white wine, then putting them, soft and pliant, onto a sheet pan. Second, by browning the skin of the chicken thighs in a saut\u00e9 pan on top of the stove instead of using the broiler. Third, by adding some bread crumbs to the mustardy spice mixture on the skin of the birds. And fourth and finally, by finishing the chicken in a very hot oven on top of the leeks, which makes the dish into a high school cover-band version of one the chef Suzanne Goin sometimes serves at her Lucques in Los Angeles.

My interpretation allows that you can serve a two-pound aged rib-eye to seven people, at least so long as there\u2019s a seven-yolk hollandaise to drizzle over the ruby-red slices of meat and a sheet-pan of smashed potatoes and a free-form salad of kale, crushed almonds, goat cheese and dried cranberries to take up the rest of the plate.\n\nThat salad, incidentally, can stand as our no-recipe recipe of the week, the chance we provide readers each Wednesday to cook off narrative suggestion, rather than from listed instructions. The ratio of nuts and cheese and fruit to greens is up to you (though you can learn a lot about the math behind your decision from Julia Moskin\u2019s ace guide to making salad), but I\u2019ll help with the dressing: a big splash of buttermilk, a dab of Dijon mustard, a healthy squeeze of lemon juice, and enough olive oil to allow it all to come together in an emulsified whole. Salt and pepper to taste. Grate a clove of garlic in there, if you desire. (I like to mix in a few cranberries and nut crumbles as well.) With a baguette and some butter, it\u2019s not a bad Wednesday night meal, not even close.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a little more time, or just want to start daydreaming about cooking this coming weekend, check out John Willoughby\u2019s ode to the country-style pork rib and his accompanying recipes: one for braised country-style pork ribs with chipotle; the other for pork stew with pears and sweet potatoes.

Our pal Alison Roman gave us two to consider. One\u2019s for a fine recipe for broccoli and Cheddar soup that tastes of like what you always think this soup should taste of when you\u2019re on the road and order it off the menu at the only restaurant open near the hotel: broccoli and cheese. (At the restaurant, invariably, it tastes only of salt.) It\u2019s so good.\n\nThe other is for a vegetarian tortilla soup that draws a lot of flavor from canned chipotles in adobo, and spreads it through tomatoes and corn.

I spent the other evening interviewing the Montreal restaurateur David McMillan on stage at the Corona Theater in Little Burgundy, before repairing across the street for an epic dinner at his restaurant Joe Beef with, among others, the Times journalists Ian Austen, Dan Bilefsky and Jasmin Lavoie. The Canadian mixed-martial artist Georges St-Pierre was at the next table, The Streets on the stereo above the wood stove in back, and all the deliciousness left me wanting to cook French food with a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois accent all weekend: to lay out some smoked trout under mustard and maple, perhaps, or saut\u00e9 sweetbreads and serve them above a sauce grenobloise, with more capers than you\u2019d think, listening to old Ren\u00e9e Martel songs.\n\nBut the children will balk. They were home in the slush and sleet while I did my difficult job in the snowy north, and the menu choices for the next few days will fall to them.

If they don\u2019t have a bright, fresh scent, they\u2019re probably dead, and you\u2019ll need a re-up before cooking, lest the stew taste chalky and pale.) I ask, they answer.\n\nFor dessert, though: only one choice. One of the kids has been knocking down fantastic versions of Katharine Hepburn\u2019s recipe for brownies, with a generous dusting of kosher salt strewn over their tops at the end, just after they come out of the oven.

In an editorial, Brent Staples underlines the seriousness of Peele\u2019s political critique, writing: \u201cThe film is a disquisition on the continuing impact of slavery in American life.

In the propaganda posters they were as thin as sticks with hook noses and blond hair. We were told they smelled bad. They had turned South Korea into a \u2018hell on earth\u2019 and were maintaining a puppet government there. The teachers never missed an opportunity to remind us of their villainy.\n\n\u201c\u2018If you meet a Yankee bastard on the street and he offers you candy, do not take it!\u2019 one teacher warned us, wagging a finger in the air. \u2018If you do, he\u2019ll claim North Korean children are beggars. Be on your guard if he asks you anything, even the most innocent questions.\u2019\u201d\n\nHmm. No wonder my attempts at interviewing North Korean kids have never been very fruitful.\n\nLee escaped to China at age 17 and started a new life in Shanghai but remained in touch with her family. One day her mom called from North Korea. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few kilos of ice,\u201d or crystal meth, she said, and she asked for Lee\u2019s help in selling it in China. \u201cIn her world, the law was upside down,\u201d Lee says, explaining how corruption and cynicism had shredded the social fabric of North Korea. \u201cPeople had to break the law to live.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder how accurate these books are, for there\u2019s some incentive when selling a memoir to embellish adventures. I don\u2019t know, and in the case of \u201cIn Order to Live,\u201d skeptics have noted inconsistencies in the stories and raised legitimate questions.\n\nSo how did North Korea come to be the most bizarre country in the world? For the history, one can\u2019t do better than Bradley K. Martin\u2019s magisterial UNDER THE LOVING CARE OF THE FATHERLY LEADER: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty (St. Martin\u2019s Griffin, paper, $29.99). Martin recounts how a minor anti-Japanese guerrilla leader named Kim Il-sung came to be installed by the Russians as leader of the half of the Korean peninsula they controlled after World War II. Martin discovers that Kim\u2019s father was a Christian and a church organist, and Kim himself attended church for a time. That didn\u2019t last, and Kim later banned pretty much all religion \u2014 though he became something of a god himself, quite a trick for an atheist. But do North Koreans really believe in this \u201creligion\u201d?\n\nJudging from defectors I\u2019ve interviewed and much of the literature on North Korea, many do \u2014 especially older people, farmers and those farther from the North Korean border. That\u2019s partly a tribute to the country\u2019s shameless propaganda, which B.R. Myers explores in his interesting book, THE CLEANEST RACE: How North Koreans See Themselves \u2014 And Why It Matters (Melville House, paper, $16). He notes that North Korea produced a poster showing a Christian missionary murdering a Korean child and calling for \u201crevenge against the Yankee vampires\u201d \u2014 at the same time that the United States was the country\u2019s single largest donor of humanitarian aid. Myers argues that North Koreans have focused on what he calls \u201crace-based paranoid nationalism,\u201d including bizarre ideas about how Koreans are \u201cthe cleanest race\u201d \u2014 hence the title \u2014 bullied and persecuted by outsiders.\n\nFor a more sympathetic view of North Korea\u2019s emergence, check out various books by Bruce Cumings, a University of Chicago historian, like KOREA\u2019S PLACE IN THE SUN: A Modern History (W.W. Norton, paper, $19.95). Cumings argues that North Korea is to some degree a genuine expression of Korean nationalism. I think Cumings is nuts when he says, \u201cit is Americans who bear the lion\u2019s share of the responsibility\u201d for the division of the Korean peninsula.

I can\u2019t think of anything worse to wish on someone. God allowed Satan to rob Job of everything, including his children\u2019s lives. Do I need to lose something more to learn God\u2019s character? Sometimes I want every know-it-all to send me a note when they face the grisly specter of death, and I\u2019ll send them a poster of a koala that says, \u201cHang in there!\u201d\n\nThe hardest lessons come from the solutions people, who are already a little disappointed that I am not saving myself. There is always a nutritional supplement, Bible verse or mental process I have not adequately tried. \u201cKeep smiling! Your attitude determines your destiny!\u201d said a stranger named Jane in an email, having heard my news somewhere, and I was immediately worn out by the tyranny of prescriptive joy.\n\nThere is a trite cruelty in the logic of the perfectly certain. Those people are not simply trying to give me something. They are tallying up the sum of my life \u2014 looking for clues, sometimes for answers \u2014 for the purpose of pronouncing a verdict. But I am not on trial. To so many people, I am no longer just myself. I am a reminder of a thought that is difficult for the rational brain to accept: that the elements that constitute our bodies might fail at any moment. When I originally got my diagnosis at age 35, all I could think to say was, \u201cBut I have a son.\u201d It was the best argument I had. I can\u2019t end. This world can\u2019t end. It had just begun.\n\nA tragedy is like a fault line. A life is split into a before and an after, and most of the time, the before was better. Few people will let you admit that out loud. Sometimes those who love you best will skip that first horrible step of saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you.\u201d Hope may prevent them from acknowledging how much has already been lost. But acknowledgment is also a mercy. It can be a smile or a simple \u201cOh, hon, what a year you\u2019ve had.\u201d It does not ask anything from me but makes a little space for me to stand there in that moment. Without it, I often feel like I am starring in a reality program about a woman who gets cancer and is very cheerful about it.\n\nAfter acknowledgment must come love. This part is tricky because when friends and acquaintances begin pouring out praise, it can sound a little too much like a eulogy. I\u2019ve had more than one kindly letter written about me in the past tense, when I need to be told who I might yet become.\n\nBut the impulse to offer encouragement is a perfect one. There is tremendous power in touch, in gifts and in affirmations when everything you knew about yourself might not be true anymore. I am a professor, but will I ever teach again? I\u2019m a mom, but for how long? A friend knits me socks and another drops off cookies, and still another writes a funny email or takes me to a concert. These seemingly small efforts are anchors that hold me to the present, that keep me from floating away on thoughts of an unknown future. They say to me, like my sister Maria did on one very bad day: \u201cYes, the world is changed, dear heart, but do not be afraid. You are loved, you are loved. You will not disappear.

A new wrinkle in the narrative is the work of the singular Brazilian artist Celso Renato (1919-1992), seen in its beguiling seven-piece United States debut at Mendes Wood DM. He was a practicing lawyer and self-taught artist who spent most of his life in Belo Horizonte in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.\n\nRenato began painting in the 1960s and by the 1980s was working with a spare geometric vocabulary applied freehand to found pieces of wood and lumber, which he tended to use unaltered. The combination made him an odd man out with the Neo-Concretists. Like them he rejected the clean rational forms of the Concretists, but he retained the earlier group\u2019s attachment to the art object\n\nHis efforts communicate and reward empathic attention. A piece of lumber shaped like a narrow irregular house about two feet tall is cracked all the way through at the center, giving it a crevicelike door. Renato simply painted a series of bars and blocks in red, black or white around its edges, giving it a kind of frame and turning it into a votive object of a female goddess. The same blocks and bars appear on a portion of an old tree trunk. They form a narrow stack at the center of the trunk\u2019s round side, like an abstract homage to the tree it was once part of.", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-31 00:00:00", "text": "In \u201cPaintings From the Old World,\u201d Gianni Politi\u2019s gallery debut in the United States, the Italian artist is showing six striking painting-related works whose presence and meanings expand as you look at them. They are a blend of painting, collage and clothing, if not fashion: shirts made from coarse, wheat-colored fabric that hang from pegs by their collars. More or less wrinkled, they resemble work shirts, or more precisely artist\u2019s smocks, since they are randomly daubed, stained and brushed with paint in lovely, fresh colors. The brush strokes conjure everything from Abstract Expressionist scumbling to Tiepolo-like sunsets, but the handiwork never crosses the seams; closer examination indicates that the fabric is actually raw linen. Mr. Politi paints on it while it is temporarily stretched, then gives it to his local tailor who cuts it up according to the artist\u2019s instructions and sews the pieces together.\n\nIn this manner, the medium is pushed from pure form toward function, perhaps from an old world where painting was men\u2019s work, or into a more demanding new world where nothing is wasted. The shirt paintings also comment on the medium\u2019s commodity status, as well as on various collaborations between artists and fashion houses, of which Jeff Koons\u2019s ridiculous Louis Vuitton handbags are but the latest example. And they play with the way that much art, especially painting, both builds on \u2014 reuses \u2014 and comments on previous art. In Mr. Politi\u2019s case, Italian Arte Povera, which had an iffy relationship, at best, to painting, might be both a source and a target. I like the piquant way these objects serve no purpose but look as if they might. I also think Mr. Politi might want to rethink his longer titles \u2014 like \u201cReally Dark Place Where We Used to Rave and Do Heavy Drugs (Happy Days).\u201d Maybe self-deprecation is the aim, but the effect is a ponderously adolescent buzzkill.\n\nROBERTA SMITH\n\nChris Dorland\n\nThrough Feb. 11.

Her art can be found in the collections of the Met, MoMA, the Whitney and more than two dozen other major museums (though too rarely displayed); her students, including Ellen Altfest and Njideka Akunyili Crosby, have risen to prominence (though their teacher\u2019s influence is subtle); and she just keeps at it. She is Catherine Murphy, and her first show of paintings in five years reaffirms that no one sees with a keener eye.\n\nWorking without a camera, Ms. Murphy paints expressly choreographed still lifes and landscapes, and her paintings appear as both windows on the world and bluntly flat physical surfaces. In \u201cBecalmed\u201d (2017), a persimmon-colored inner tube floats in a lake, and both the toy and the water reflect nearby foliage: In the plastic doughnut, reeds appear as ghostly spindles, while the surface of the lake is splotched with upside-down pine branches.

Both these paintings get their force from the counterbalancing of reality and reflection, image and object, canvas and screen \u2014 and, more than their narrative overtones, it\u2019s their perceptual complexity that makes the greatest impact.

Jewish, she escaped deportation thanks to the shelter of a Catholic friend in the south of France, and later in Paris she became friendly with Emmanuel Levinas, the great philosopher of ethics in the wake of the Holocaust. As early as the 1950s, when she overlaid a slate gray board with scumbles of white and black (all her paintings are untitled), Ms. Brunschwig forswore the strategies of both figuration and gestural abstraction in favor of speechless evocations of emptiness. Soon, influenced by Chinese painting, she began to work on paper with opaque India ink, covering the surfaces with saturated zones of black and leaving hazy-edged, abraded voids in the form of trapezoids, lozenges or stalactites. In one recent work here, painted in a leporello (that is, a book whose pages are folded into one another accordion-style), calligraphic black stripes grow denser and denser from page to page, and the resultant blackout has the weight of history.\n\nPhoto\n\nSlowly, in shows such as \u201cSoldier, Spectre, Shaman,\u201d at MoMA, and \u201cPostwar,\u201d at the Haus der Kunst, in Munich, curators are beginning to rewrite the history of European painting after 1945 as something more than a surrender to America\u2019s avant-garde \u2014 and to place the devastation of the Holocaust at the very center of that story. Ms. Brunschwig\u2019s resolute, comfortless art is a critical component of that history, and it is through the very absence of images that she bears witness to the unspeakable.\n\nJASON FARAGO\n\nNaeem Mohaiemen\n\nThrough March 11. MoMA PS1, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Queens; 718-784-2084, momaps1.org.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the standout artists in last summer\u2019s \u201cdocumenta 14\u201d exhibition, held in Athens and Kassel, Germany, was Naeem Mohaiemen. In Kassel, Mr. Mohaiemen presented a terrific three-channel video, \u201cTwo Meetings and a Funeral\u201d (2017), about Bangladesh\u2019s shift from socialism to Islamism in the mid-1970s. In Athens, he showed \u201cTripoli Cancelled\u201d (2017), which is currently on view in the exhibition \u201cThere Is No Last Man\u201d at MoMA PS1. (Mr. Mohaiemen was also part of a group of artists who signed a petition to protect documenta from becoming an entirely \u201ccommercial enterprise.\u201d)\n\n\u201cTripoli Cancelled\u201d was inspired by an actual story about Mr. Mohaiemen\u2019s father, a Bangladeshi doctor who worked in Libya and in 1977 was stranded in Athens\u2019s Ellinikon Airport (an abandoned structure designed by Eero Saarinen that was recently used to house refugees) for nine days after leaving his passport at a preceding checkpoint. Mr. Mohaiemen\u2019s fictional version of the tale is magically existential \u2014 like Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett mixed with Julio Cort\u00e1zar, threaded through the needle of colonialism and 21st-century security states.\n\nFor \u201cVolume Eleven (Flaw in the Algorithm of Cosmopolitanism)\u201d (2016), Mr. Mohaiemen digs into another interesting episode in 20th-century history: his great-uncle, the Bengali writer Syed Mujtaba Ali, who wrote in support of Hitler\u2019s Germany in the late 1930s as a way of challenging the British Empire. Displayed as a series of diptych photographs of his uncle\u2019s writing, in a darkened room at PS1, the work highlights our own culpabilities and the possibility of falling on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of history. This is obviously a concern for Mr. Mohaiemen as an artist-activist. And yet he aptly shows not just how the personal is always entwined with the political, but how history veers from neat linear narratives into circular, concentric and even fantastic and unimaginable patterns and designs.\n\nMARTHA SCHWENDENER\n\nYasuo Ihara\n\nThrough Jan. 21.

But here in New York, where he arrived in 1963 and found work as a costume designer, his practice took a tilt toward the conceptual. In 1971, he began making latex casts of household objects and preserving the casts in carefully labeled Plexiglas boxes. Ihara died in 2010.

(Not for nothing did Ms. Tanabe hang Maryam Amiryani\u2019s tiny black-and-white painting of Jorge Luis Borges in the gallery\u2019s office.)

It is also altering the pecking order and business practices of Wall Street in profound ways.\n\nNowhere is the shift more pronounced, or more painful, than at Goldman Sachs Group, not long ago regarded as the unrivaled king of Wall Street. These days, the bank is fighting to maintain an edge that has been blunted by the diminution of its core trading business.\n\nAt its peak, Goldman\u2019s fixed-income division churned out nearly a billion dollars every two weeks. Last year, it took the bank an average of more than two months to earn that sum.\n\nThe shift has left its once cocksure traders at times reeling. One day last spring, for example, they were caught by surprise when energy prices began to move sharply. After a few inquiries, the traders learned that Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, the Mexican state energy company, known as Pemex, was buying instruments designed to protect against the possibility of falling oil prices.\n\nNot only was Pemex not using Goldman to execute the trades, but Goldman hadn\u2019t even been aware that the trades were happening. It was a rude awakening for Goldman, which previously had done tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of work for the Mexican government, helping it protect itself against swings in the oil market, current and former employees with knowledge of the trades said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil a few years ago, traders at big banks spent much of their time wagering on the future direction of markets.

Founded in 2000, it originally served as a behind-the-scenes broker, helping big banks make complex trades with one another, out of view of the investors and money managers who were the banks\u2019 customers. These days, though, Jane Street offers the same services as the banks but with more power to automate trades.\n\nMichael Bumkeun Cho, a portfolio manager at Samsung Asset Management in Seoul, South Korea, which manages $200 billion, specializes in the trading of exchange-traded funds, baskets of stocks or bonds that are easily traded. He said he had stopped relying exclusively on banks for his trading when he learned that Jane Street responded more quickly to his trading orders and charged lower fees.\n\n\u201cWe understand the advantage of the independent market makers over the big investment banks,\u201d Mr. Cho said.\n\nCitadel Securities, part of the Chicago-based hedge fund conglomerate run by Kenneth C.

It is not the first time Turkey has intervened: In August 2016, it launched a major offensive to clear ISIS remnants from their border stronghold, and to roll back gains by Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nMr. Erdogan fears that the Syrian Kurds would use control of much of northern Syria to support the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, also known as the P.K.K., a separatist group that Turkey, the United States and the European Union all consider a terrorist group.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere\u2019s where things get complicated. The United States has armed a Syrian Kurdish militia, the People\u2019s Protection Units, that has played a crucial role in battling ISIS. That militia was founded as the armed wing of a leftist party that grew out of the P.K.K.\n\nAs the fight against ISIS nears an end, Turkey fears that the militia will turn its attention toward helping its Kurdish allies in Turkey. That fear is not entirely unjustified, according to Renad Mansour, a scholar at Chatham House in London, who points out that Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party leader imprisoned since 1999, was based in Kurdish Syria for nearly two decades.\n\nAmy Austin Holmes, a fellow at the Wilson Center who has studied the Syrian Kurds, says that many of them joined the Protection Units \u201cfor the simple reason that they wanted to defend their towns, like Kobani, that were under attack from the Islamic State, and not necessarily because they were convinced by the ideology of the P.K.K.\u201d\n\nMichael M. Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech who also studies the Syrian Kurds, said, \u201cThe Turks overplay the threat, but it\u2019s not completely a figment of their imagination.\u201d\n\nHow did the Kurds end up in the middle of all this?\n\nThe Kurds have been one of the United States\u2019 most effective allies in the fight against ISIS, and the implosion of authority in Syria in 2011, and in Iraq in 2003, revived the aspirations of a people often described as the world\u2019s largest stateless nation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nISIS, a mostly Sunni movement, considers Kurds and Shiites apostates and heretics. The Kurds have also recruited, trained and promoted women as fighters, a rare sight in the Middle East.\n\nThe Kurds make up a substantial minority in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey, and while some share aspirations of an independent Kurdish nation, that aspiration is far from universal. In particular, the leadership of the largely autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq has close economic ties to Turkey and is skeptical of the Syrian Kurds.\n\nPhoto\n\nPartly to avoid the appearance of siding too closely with the Kurds, the United States helped organize a multiethnic force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, in 2015 to help lead the fight against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe knew this day would come, when ISIS would be defeated and the U.S. would have to decide what to do: stop supporting the S.D.F., or continue supporting them,\u201d Mr. Gunter said.\n\nJordi Tejel, a historian at the University of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland, said that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\u2019s announcement last week that the United States would support a new, 30,000-strong, Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria helped precipitate the Turkish attack.

But he warned that this approach was unlikely to succeed if Mr. Assad stayed in power.\n\nThe conflict now risks pitting former allies against each other: Members of the Free Syrian Army, a loose coalition of American-backed moderate rebels fighting Mr. Assad, are now fighting alongside the Turkish Army against the Kurds.\n\nIn the long run, Mr. Van Dam said, Washington will probably consider its alliance with Turkey to be more important than its relationship with the Kurds.", "title": "What\u2019s Behind Turkey\u2019s Attack on Syria\u2019s Kurds", "authors": ["Sewell Chan"]}

For example for just these 21 majors, the difference in the median goes from a low of $2.2 million in education to a high of $4.2 million in chemical engineering \u2014 almost twice as large. Many of you wrote about how unfair this is.

We often have skewed views of wages. This is a great and easy-to-digest example. This also shows what\u2019s wrong in the job market. Teachers are paid the least even though they provide an extremely important service to the entire country. They are needed by this country, and we have let them down. They need to be paid more ... and that has a huge impact on the future of this country. It is also important to notice the lack of information the graph provides about the survey, and to take the information with a grain of salt.\n\nHis last sentence brings up the questions: Where do these data come from? Was it from a survey or a statistical model? If a survey, who was included and what questions were asked? How was \u201cprojected career earnings\u201d calculated?\n\nThe New York Times article \u201cSix Myths About Choosing a Major\u201d was part of the November 5, 2017 Education Life section.

Which is easier to interpret \u2014 the article\u2019s boxplots, the table or the time series graph?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere are some questions you may want to think about critically:\n\n\u2022 Learn some more about boxplots from the Stat Nuggets below or elsewhere.

Which majors tend to have the least career earnings and most career earnings? Do career earnings vary more above or below the median? What does this imply?\n\n\u2022 The length of each segment of the boxplot shows the variability of the earnings within that segment. (See the Stat Nugget Percentiles & Quartiles below.) Which majors have the greatest variability in earnings? The least variability? How might this affect your view of the career?\n\n\u2022 \u201cMajor\u201d is not the same as \u201ccareer.\u201d Identify careers that do not fit into a specific major, like being an actor, minister or lawyer. Where would these individuals be in the boxplots?\n\n\u2022 If college students studied this graph and many decided to major in the fields with the greatest earnings, how do you think this would affect earnings for these majors?\n\nBelow in Stat Nuggets, we define and explain boxplots and their components: percentiles, quartiles and median. Look into the archives to see past Stat Nuggets terms.\n\nThank you for participating in \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d, which is intended to have you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data in a news story.

Maybe the graph will be about love.\n\n_________\n\nStat Nuggets for \u201cSix Myths About Choosing a Major\u201d\n\nPERCENTILES & QUARTILES\n\nPercentiles are numbers that divide ordered, quantitative datasets into one-hundredths. After putting data in order from smallest to largest, you can find the percentiles. For example, for the 90th percentile, 90% of the data is less than this value.\n\nQuartiles are numbers that divide data into quarters. The 25th percentile is called the first quartile (Q1). 25% of the data is less than Q1. The 50th percentile is called the median and is the second quartile (Q2). 50% of the data is less than the median. The 75th percentile is the third quartile (Q3). 75% of the data is less than Q3.\n\nLet\u2019s look at college graduates that have degrees in chemical engineering. Someone in this field who is at the 10th percentile among their peers is projected to earn about $2.5 million dollars over their entire career. Is that a lot? What do you think that breaks down to in terms of dollars per year? What about the highest performers in chemical engineering? Someone who is at the 90th percentile is projected to earn about $5.8 million over their entire career. Is this substantially better than the projected career earnings in other fields?\n\nMEDIAN\n\nThe median is the middle value of the data when the data is put in order from smallest to largest. Half of the values are less than the median and half are greater.\n\nFor example, for general business, the median projected career earnings for college graduates is about $3.1 million, which is less than the median for nursing.\n\nBOXPLOT\n\nA boxplot is a graph on a number line that shows five statistics from quantitative data \u2014 minimum value, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3) and maximum value.\n\nThis graph is sometimes called a box and whiskers plot when the values between the 1st and 3rd quartile are bounded with a box and the median marked in the box. The minimum and maximum are shown with \u201cwhiskers\u201d extending outside the box.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this graph, we have a variation of a boxplot. Of the five statistics, we see the 25th percentile (Q1), the median and 75th percentile (Q3). The minimum and the maximum are not shown. Why? For each career, there\u2019s probably someone who earns nothing as well as someone who earns millions of dollars. So, a minimum of $0 and a maximum of $5,000,000+ would not be very informative about what career earnings are expected. Instead, the 10th and 90th percentiles are shown to give a clearer idea of what the middle 80% of college graduates are projected to earn by major.\n\nNote that the center \u201cbox\u201d with half of the data (75% - 25% = 50%) is in a darker color. These are the most typical earnings. Also, notice that the four quarters are not of equal length. Longer segments indicate that earnings are more spread out. For example, look at the variability in the top earners that have degrees in the humanities. There are some who make a lot more than others in this major! Who could they be? Famous writers or even humanities majors who went into seemingly unrelated fields.\n\n_________\n\nThe graphs for \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney, the Statistics Content Director at Mass Insight Education.

Those events are being dramatized on Paramount\u2019s \u201cWaco,\u201d starring Taylor Kitsch. A&E takes a different approach on Sunday, with a documentary special that includes footage of Mr. Koresh during the 51-day standoff.

The count and his band of fellow monarchists, however, are determined to make their case at conferences, in editorials and at fancy balls.\n\nA recent study that examined the economic performance of monarchies versus republics bolsters their views. Led by Mauro F. Guill\u00e9n, a management professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the study found \u201crobust and quantitatively meaningful evidence\u201d that monarchies outperform other forms of government.\n\nPhoto\n\nFar from being a dying system, the study said, \u201cmonarchies are surprisingly prevalent around the world.\u201d They provide a \u201cstability that often translates into economic gains\u201d; they are better at protecting property rights and checking abuses of power by elected officials; and they have higher per-capita national incomes, the study said.\n\nMr. Guill\u00e9n says he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the results, which have not yet been published. \u201cMost people think monarchies are something anachronistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think that modern forms of government are superior and have trouble accepting that monarchies have advantages.\u201d\n\nWhen he presents his findings, \u201cthere is more skepticism in the room than with the average paper,\u201d said Mr. Guill\u00e9n, who is not a monarchist. \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nHis findings come as no surprise, however, to monarchists, who aim to preserve existing monarchies and to support royals who live in exile. They believe that countries with exiled royals should return them to the throne, and that nations without monarchies should consider a switch.\n\n\u201cWe support the retention and restoration of monarchies anywhere in the world,\u201d Count Tolstoy said. \u201cOur goal is to persuade people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHistory books, of course, are replete with examples of monarchies that became symbols of repression and rapacious, cloistered wealth. Some were ousted by bloody rebellions (the American and French Revolutions) or collapsed in ruins (the Hapsburg Empire), and many have ruthlessly marginalized whole classes of people.\n\nConstitutions, Not Absolute Control\n\nBut Count Tolstoy insists that monarchists are not pining for the days of absolute rulers and the divine right of kings, when Henry VIII of England could order up the execution of unwanted wives and political foes.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead, his group advocates constitutional monarchies, in which a king or queen is head of state and the real power rests with an elected Parliament \u2014 much like those in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain (although demonstrators in 2014 demanded a referendum on the Spanish royal family after King Juan Carlos abdicated).\n\nAll of those countries, the monarchists note, have relatively strong economies.\n\nMr. Guill\u00e9n\u2019s study shows that since 1900, 22 countries have abandoned royal leaders, while 35 others adopted them. Forms of constitutional monarchies took root, at least for some time, in emerging economies like Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nStill, the study noted that some current monarchies lack basic democratic freedoms, including in Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland.\n\nAfter the Arab Spring, some analysts noted that monarchies like Morocco, Jordan and the Gulf States demonstrated much more stability than countries like Iraq, Libya and Egypt.\n\nBut Sean L. Yom, a political-science professor at Temple University who studies Middle Eastern governments, said that stability might be fleeting: With some of those monarchies propped up by oil money rather than a love of any royal family, \u201cmonarchies are on their way out,\u201d Mr. Yom said.\n\n\u201cThose surviving in the Middle East are the very lucky survivors of history, and it is just taking more time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese countries look so good only because their neighbors look so bad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nContesting the Throne\n\nFinding people to reject the monarchists\u2019 vision is not hard, even in Britain, where Queen Elizabeth II is revered by many.\n\nPhoto\n\nA London-based grass-roots organization called Republic, which wants the country to hold a referendum on the monarchy when the queen dies, says bluntly on its website, \u201cThe monarchy isn\u2019t fit for purpose. It is corrupt and secretive.\u201d\n\nThe group has a clear mandate: \u201cWe want to see the monarchy abolished and the queen replaced with an elected democratic head of state,\u201d it says.\n\nGraham Smith, Republic\u2019s chief executive, said that current polls showed about 20 to 25 percent of Britons to be anti-royalty, and that it had been hard to win broader support. \u201cOur job is to keep raising that number,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cpublic opinion takes time to shift.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

You cannot just pluck a family out of obscurity and put them in charge of a country.\u201d\n\nCount Tolstoy acknowledges that the International Monarchist League had turned into a \u201cleague of eccentrics\u201d under its former chancellor, Victor Hervey, who had been jailed for a jewel heist, worked as an arms dealer and sought tax exile in Monaco.\n\nIt was founded in 1943 on the belief that the monarchies of Eastern Europe could be a bulwark against Soviet expansion. Count Tolstoy took over in the mid-1980s, and says the current members are \u201csensible, run-of-the-mill people.\u201d\n\nCount Tolstoy has written books on ancient and postwar British history. He has also run, unsuccessfully, as a parliamentary candidate for the far-right U.K. Independence Party in four general elections.\n\nPhoto\n\nKing of the United States\n\nWhen he considers the United States, Count Tolstoy is certain it would be better off without a presidency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is an alternative,\u201d he wrote in an opinion article for The New York Times before the 2016 election. He noted that neither candidate \u201cappears to be a Washington or a Lincoln,\u201d and pointed to a neighbor as an example: Canada, he wrote, \u201cdemonstrates that democracy is perfectly compatible with constitutional monarchy.\u201d \u201c\n\nBut being an American monarchist can be a tough sell. The country, after all, was born of rebellion against a British king.\n\nCharles A. Coulombe of Los Angeles, a former stand-up comic and a monarchist, said, \u201cIf you say you are a monarchist, there is a strain of disloyalty or treason.\u201d\n\nThere are no reliable estimates of how many monarchists there are in the United States. But to help disseminate their message, a Washington think tank, the Center for the Study of Monarchy, Traditional Governance and Sovereignty, opened this past year.\n\nAmerican monarchists also find ways to help the cause abroad. Thomas R. Hutson, a retired State Department diplomat who was posted in Belgrade, has been advocating the restoration of Alexander, the crown prince of Yugoslavia, as the monarch of Serbia.\n\nOn his own dime, Mr. Hutson has repeatedly traveled to Serbia to promote the prince, who was born in exile in London and later moved to Belgrade. But Mr. Hutson admits that he is making little headway.\n\n\u201cI tell people I\u2019m a monarchist and the conversation lasts three seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is resoundingly no interest in him coming back as king. It\u2019s a generational thing. The monarchy completely goes by young people who lack of a sense of history.\u201d\n\nHe insists, however: \u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Canon Kenneth W. Gunn-Walberg, the rector of St. Mary\u2019s Anglican Church in Wilmington, Del., and leader of the Monarchist League\u2019s chapter for the Eastern states, said the appeal of monarchies was simple.\n\n\u201cThere is style, a mystery and ethos with a monarch,\u201d he said. \u201cPresidents come and go.

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "But the vagueness of the concept served only to heighten hysteria. \u201cMenticide,\u201d announced the Columbia University psychiatrist Joost Meerloo, was a crime against humanity analogous to \u2014 or even worse than \u2014 genocide. The conceit spawned an array of nightmare scenarios. The worst of them appeared to be confirmed when 21 American prisoners refused repatriation after an armistice halted the Korean War in July 1953. Since a preference for \u201cRed China\u201d over America seemed inconceivable to many contemporaries, the conclusion was that the men must have been brainwashed. An unequivocal New York Times editorial in January 1954 evinced no doubt whatsoever. The \u201cnon-repatriates\u201d offered \u201cliving proof that Communist brainwashing does work on some persons,\u201d The Times informed its readers.\n\nFixated on these \u201cturncoat G.I.s,\u201d United States commentators tended to forget that an inordinately greater number of North Korean and Chinese P.O.W.s had refused repatriation to their side. What might have registered as a symbolic victory for the \u201cfree world\u201d \u2014 22,000 to 21 \u2014 was lost in heated contention over how brainwashing was performed and why Americans had seemingly succumbed en masse.\n\nA vast majority of American P.O.W.s who survived captivity did return home \u2014 as, eventually, did almost all of the 21 men supposedly lost to brainwashing. But many found themselves suspected as traitors or ideological termites, sent back by their Communist captors to hollow out American society from within. Insidious plots subsequently made popular by fiction \u2014 think \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d \u2014 appeared first in the pages of serious newsmagazines. In The Saturday Evening Post, Rear Adm. D. V. Gallery speculated that the Communists had expended so much energy on brainwashing American P.O.W.s to create a network of sleeper saboteurs awaiting activation. The Chinese, according to Admiral Gallery, had sown mental seeds they anticipated would \u201ctake root\u201d and sprout in 10 or 20 years should another depression grip America. \u201cThis may seem far-fetched to those of us who live from year to year,\u201d he acknowledged, before adding an Orientalist twist to his scenario. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t to Asiatics, who look at centuries as we do months.\u201d\n\nWhy did people take \u201cbrainwashing\u201d so seriously, despite the best efforts of prominent social scientists to debunk outr\u00e9 Pavlovian notions and the racist stereotypes often used to buttress them? And why does \u201celection hacking\u201d exert a comparable allure? Anxieties about external manipulation are not, of course, divorced from the demonstrable efforts of other powers to sway Americans\u2019 politically consequential behavior: The theft and distribution of Democratic National Committee emails was real enough, as was the Chinese effort to win converts among captive Americans imprisoned in North Korea. But \u201celection hacking\u201d and \u201cbrainwashing\u201d share an aura of dark magic that obscures the precise mechanics believed to be at work in shaping the thoughts and actions of freethinking adults. And obscurity provides fertile soil in which conspiracy theories flourish. When everything is, or may be, a form of \u201celection hacking,\u201d the techniques appear worrisomely diffuse. So, too, do the agents of a phenomenon variously attributed to Russian trolls, Twitter-bots, Facebook ads, a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d in the White House or American idiocy more generally.\n\nAnxiety over new technology also helps explain how concerns over foreign mental meddling metastasized in both the 1950s and present-day United States. Then as now, Americans fretted not only over the Kremlin\u2019s machinations but also over the ways in which a pervasive new medium was simultaneously bringing people closer while turning living rooms into isolated bubbles. Where today we devote acres of type to parsing the antisocial pitfalls of social media, anatomists of the \u201950s rued the destructive potential of television \u2014 whether to empower populist maniacs or induce Americans to crave new consumer goods they neither wanted nor needed. Now we ponder mysterious algorithms that mine our every online keystroke for lucrative potential; then, Americans got wise to techniques of \u201csubliminal suggestion\u201d that advertising wizards apparently employed to turn psychic soft spots into sales.", "title": "Opinion | When Americans Were Afraid of Being Brainwashed", "authors": []}

I don\u2019t trust the body and fear the ways it can turn on you. At an early age I decided that the only way to stall death or pain, or both, is to wield a lion tamer\u2019s whip and keep cracking at the body, change after change.\n\nFor me, change is as much an enemy as weight gain and the body itself. Puberty is one of the most frequently discussed risk periods for the development of eating disorders. The frustration I have with the focus on puberty and eating disorders is that it doesn\u2019t address the fact that every stage of life for a person with an eating disorder presents enormous changes.\n\nMy triggers have included puberty, leaving home for the first time, and getting pregnant. As I age, they may include watching my own children leave the nest and confronting my mortality.\n\nMy heart hurts thinking about a teen anorexic sitting in her suburban bedroom, one change down and hundreds more to go. She may believe that eating dessert one day means she\u2019s saved. That she can then bid farewell to therapy and go enjoy a banquet of delicious foods for the rest of her life. I hope that\u2019s her fate, but for an anorexic, it isn\u2019t always the resolution.\n\nI refuse to call myself fully healed because there is still work to do. Some days it\u2019s easy work, other days it\u2019s work that makes me break down in tears on my husband\u2019s lap. But it\u2019s work that must be done every morning, every evening, at every meal.\n\nThis is the way I keep healing.", "title": "When Anorexics Grow Up", "authors": ["Lisa Fogarty"]}

A staff member, as opposed to an outsider, leads in the interim. The staff, as a whole, has access to additional professional development. Durfee gives $45,000 to the recipient\u2019s organization to cover the cost of the leader\u2019s salary, and also provides $3,000 to the interim leader and $5,000 for organization-wide professional development.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty radical when you think about it. Nonprofit leaders, who are normally forced to paint the rosiest picture possible when describing their work to foundations, are instead invited to be honest about the challenges they face professionally and personally.\n\nDurfee\u2019s president, Carrie Avery, recalls one sabbatical seeker who entered the foundation\u2019s office for his interview in a starched shirt and tie, his game face firmly in place, and then melted down when he started being asked questions: \u201cHe sobbed while rapidly consuming five cookies,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was in a really big position and it was like he finally had a chance to be vulnerable. He got a sabbatical and it had a huge impact on his leadership.\u201d\n\nAvery says that leaders are encouraged to become \u201crigorously unproductive\u201d during their sabbaticals, which is easier for some than others. \u201cChildren of immigrants seem to have a particularly hard time with this,\u201d she observed. \u201cOn top of the twisted nonprofit sector message that every E.D. has to be self-sacrificing and overworked, they\u2019ve got parents who worked multiple jobs while they were growing up. A sabbatical can feel very privileged.\u201d\n\nOther foundations are following in Durfee\u2019s footsteps, notably the Barr Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation, the Rasmuson Foundation and the Meyer Foundation. Linnell estimates that more than a dozen foundations now have official sabbatical funding available. Nevertheless, that is a very small proportion of the more than 86,000 foundations in the United States, by the count of the Foundation Center.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to misunderstand sabbaticals as little more than extended vacations. After working in the nonprofit sector for nearly 40 years, Linnell believes that sabbaticals are one of the most effective investments a foundation can make in an organization or a cause.\n\nThe biggest payoff? The capacity to think clearly and expansively. \u201cLeaders who are stuck in reactive or even adaptive leadership mode have a chance to refresh themselves and reconnect with their original passion for their cause,\u201d Linnell explained. \u201cThey are able to do catalytic generative thinking again.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | When Being Unproductive Saves a Career", "authors": []}

They should be giving back,\u201d he said as his mother, also an activist, served us lemonade in his living room.\n\n\u201cWe have this political class that totally forgets why they are there. Suddenly it\u2019s all about the possibility of business,\u201d he said, referring to rampant political corruption.\n\nWe were starting to see what he meant. Monterrey\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t just crime. It was institutional breakdown at nearly every level of government, which allowed corruption to become the norm, including among police officers who sometimes beat citizens and extort money from them just as brazenly as did the drug gangs.\n\nFixing crime required fixing corruption, which required fixing the state.\n\nThat was also the conclusion reached by Monterrey\u2019s business leaders. Except instead of fixing the state, they would cut it out.\n\nJorge Tello, a former head of Mexico\u2019s intelligence agency and now a big man about town, met us at his private lunch club, just across from city hall, to tell us how it\u2019d all happened.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I remember was with the governor at Lorenzo\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Tello said, referring to Lorenzo Zambrano, the head of Cemex and unofficial leader of Monterrey\u2019s business community until his death in 2014.\n\nDrug cartels, after years of ravaging poorer communities, had begun to target the richest of the rich.\n\n\u201cThe governor was the one to say: \u2018You need to help me. I cannot do it by myself,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tello recounted. It was a tacit admission of the state\u2019s weakness.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo get what happened next, you need to understand Monterrey\u2019s peculiar corporate culture.

But first he would ensure that Monterrey\u2019s executives would remain to help lead \u2014 and, crucially, to fund \u2014 the effort. Some were already considering a move to nearby Houston.\n\nSo Mr. Zambrano posted a tweet that Monterrey\u2019s business leaders still cite as a call to arms. It read, translated into English: \u201cWhoever leaves Monterrey is a coward. They must fight for what we believe. We must return to our great city!\u201d\n\nAfter a few years, community leaders like Mr. Torjes saw an improvement. As an experimental new police force moved into the streets, backed by the executives, crime and reports of police brutality dropped.\n\nThe reforms were an academic\u2019s dream. Juan Salgado, a governance expert at the CIDE, a Mexico City university, called the new force \u201cvery impressive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat they did was create comprehensive community police services,\u201d he said, detailing reforms that benefited from the C.E.O.s\u2019 largess and as well their ability to skip the usual political corruption and horse trading.\n\nBut then, he said, \u201cthere was a change in the government.\u201d\n\nNo one in official or corporate Monterrey likes to talk about what happened in 2015. No one except for Mr. Tello, who said it was important that the city face what had happened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting mad,\u201d he said, remembering it.\n\nThe governor left office that year. (He later faced embezzlement charges, which we mention only to underscore that official corruption is just pervasive.) Monterrey\u2019s executives, maybe a little taken with their newfound autonomy, backed an independent candidate whom they expected would be even more pliant.\n\nBut the new governor, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n, turned out not to be pliant. He has mixed fiery populist language with old-style patronage. Reforms have lapsed and crime has returned.\n\nMr. Torjes, the activist from the working-class suburb, argued that the real problem wasn\u2019t the governor himself but a political system in which reforms never seem to stick.\n\n\u201cEvery politician comes in and brings something new,\u201d he said; a complaint we heard from activists and academics across Mexico. \u201cYou never know if something is going to last past the next election.\u201d\n\nThis was our big realization from our time in Monterrey. The Mexican state \u2014 which oversees the world\u2019s tenth-largest population and 14th largest landmass \u2014 is perilously weak.\n\nIts institutions are too weak to fix the crime and corruption tearing away at society. They are too weak even to maintain a fix that, as in Monterrey, is already working.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite different than if you talk about well-developed countries with strong institutions,\u201d Mr. Tello said. In countries like the United States, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what kind of mess you have at the top of the political structure because you have strong institutions.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMonterrey\u2019s business leaders had tried to install their corporations as replacement institutions. But they fell victim to the same institutional weaknesses they\u2019d tried to fix. With little in the way of a civil service, a simple change in governor destabilized everything.\n\nThat might seem like a technical or abstract lesson, but it\u2019s one that should concern everybody, and not just in Mexico. We don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the health of our institutions; they\u2019re boring, opaque and largely unseen. But maybe we should think about them.\n\nMany of the biggest stories in the last year \u2014 ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, democratic backsliding in Turkey and in Venezuela, regime change in Zimbabwe, a destabilizing power struggle in Saudi Arabia \u2014 come down, in part, to weak institutions. They are the guardrails meant to keep government orderly, capable and self-policing. Without them, you have corruption, instability, power grabs and leaders whose incentives do not align with the public good.\n\nEven in the developed countries that Mr. Tello called categorically different, institutional health can\u2019t be taken for granted. Spain has been destabilized by a secession movement led by some of its own regional institutions. Hungary and Poland, unchecked by courts and legislatures that have grown weak, are backsliding into authoritarianism. American diplomats, aghast at the gutting of the State Department, warn that American power in the world could be set back by a generation.\n\nMany of Mexico\u2019s leaders, like Monterrey\u2019s business elite, hardly noticed their country\u2019s institutional decline until they started feeling the effects personally.

How often does that happen, and what happens to minors in that situation?\n\nFor the year that ended in October, 22 of every 10,000 flights were diverted on average, according to the Department of Transportation. But many of those flights did not require an overnight stay at the unexpected stop because the planes eventually took off again and got where they were going. American said six in 10,000 diverted during the evening in 2017 and spent the night in that spot; Southwest did not provide a figure. Meanwhile, there are not minors flying without parents on every flight.\n\nStill, stuff happens, as Thursday\u2019s powerful storm proved. Most carriers try to keep unaccompanied minors off the last flights of the day. Indeed, I worried a bit about this as my daughter\u2019s early-evening flight home from Chicago was delayed for hours, even though we had rehearsed a sort-of Buffalo scenario in which she ended up on the ground in a city between Chicago and New York where no one we knew could go pick her up. It involved first calling us on her cellphone, the existence of which makes solo flying more comfortable for everyone.\n\nMy mind also wandered to Susan Burton\u2019s poignant segment on the radio program \u201cThis American Life,\u201d about being snowed in at O\u2019Hare with other children of divorce when she was younger, which is the very next thing you should listen to on whatever device you have nearby.\n\nWhen things do go awry, Mr. Taylor said, Southwest will not take kids out of the airport and will instead keep watch over them through the wee hours. If my 12-year-old had been in that situation even outside its unaccompanied minor service, she would have been free to hang out with the kids whose parents had paid the fee, but could also have left the airport on her own. My wife and I probably would have told her to stay rather than trying to find a hotel room late at night.\n\nA spokesman for American, Ross Feinstein, offered more options for the airline\u2019s younger travelers. He said it would try to call parents and see if they wanted their kids to go to a hotel, perhaps with an airline staff member staying next door or even in the same room if the family was comfortable with that.\n\nFor all of Ms. Skenazy\u2019s professional bravado, she gets that diversions are a part of life. Maybe even a good part, the part where the kids wander around the terminal and eat caramel corn for dinner instead of the emergency sandwich in their bag and then band together with strangers to make the best of a bad situation.\n\n\u201cWhen I ask people about their best childhood memories, it\u2019s often about when something went wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thrown off your game and you handle it, it\u2019s the wind beneath your wings forevermore.\u201d", "title": "When It Costs Double to Let Your 12-Year-Old Fly Alone", "authors": []}

There were no untoward episodes during the sleepovers, he said. \u201cThese people are my friends,\u201d he told a Chicago radio station, insisting on his right to have friends over to spend the night.\n\nThat\u2019s not how Elgin officials viewed it. To them, Mr. Schiller in effect had created a shelter of his own and blatantly flouted various ordinances, for instance by not having enough exits from the basement in case of a fire. \u201cWe understand where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d Laura Valdez, the assistant city manager, said, \u201cbut we do have shelters for the homeless.\u201d At any given time, she said, her city of about 110,000 has about 100 men and women in need of shelter.\n\nNot everybody in need, though, wishes to spend the night in a municipally sanctioned facility, whether out of safety fears or out of innate resistance to the rules. That is as true in Elgin as it is in a vastly larger city like New York. So a fair question would seem to be whether Mr. Schiller\u2019s offer of a place for these people to lay their heads in severe weather outweighs city codes governing full-time shelters.\n\nOne person who thinks so is Jeff Rowes, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice, a public-interest firm in Arlington, Va., with a libertarian bent. He has been in touch with Mr. Schiller. \u201cFundamentally,\u201d Mr. Rowes said, \u201cyou have a right to rescue people unless there\u2019s evidence you\u2019ll do more harm than good.\u201d He called it \u201cthe right to be a good Samaritan.\u201d\n\nAfter this dispute became the focus of news articles, Mr. Schiller and Elgin officials discussed ways in which the city might work harder to shelter all the homeless on the coldest nights, perhaps even allowing them to sleep in the lobby of a police station. Satisfied for now, Mr. Schiller said he would drop his plan to sue the municipality. In a way, that\u2019s too bad, because a court case might help clarify how far the sanctity of one\u2019s castle extends.\n\n\u201cI respect the city codes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do believe a little leeway, a little grace, could have been in order.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | When Mercy Collides With the Law", "authors": []}

In August 2014 Islamic State militants besieged her village of Kocho in northern Iraq. They executed nearly all the men and older women \u2014 including Murad\u2019s mother and six brothers \u2014 and buried them in mass graves. The younger women, Murad among them, were kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery. Raped, tortured and exchanged among militants, 21-year-old Murad finds an escape route when she is sold to a jihadist in Mosul who leaves a front door unlocked. She flees into Kurdistan by posing as the wife of a Sunni man, Nasser, who risks everything to escort her to safety.\n\nPhoto\n\nJust when Murad, and the reader, expect a flood of relief, there is another sinister turn: Murad and Nasser are detained by Kurdish officials who force them to testify about their escape with cameras rolling. The officials are eager to hear how peshmerga fighters from a rival Kurdish faction \u2014 the two groups fought a civil war in the 1990s \u2014 had abandoned the Yazidi communities they were supposed to protect. The officials swear no one will ever see the tape, but it appears on the news that same night, putting Nasser and his family in grave danger. \u201cI was quickly learning that my story, which I still thought of as a personal tragedy, could be someone else\u2019s political tool,\u201d Murad writes.\n\nFreed from captivity, Murad remains trapped inside politics. To publish \u201cThe Last Girl\u201d right now, in the United States, means there are tricky issues of sensationalism to navigate; in a threatening climate of Islamophobia, Muslims of all kinds are vilified for the actions of one group. Yet Murad, and the team of translators and writers with whom she worked, hedge against this response with a book intricate in historical context. Visible throughout are the disastrous legacies of the American intervention that dismantled Baathist institutions and bred a generation of Iraqis raised on violence and with few prospects. In a childhood flashback, a young Nadia receives a ring from one of the many American soldiers who arrived in Kocho in the mid-2000s bearing trinkets and empty promises. During the Iraq war, Yazidis became increasingly isolated from their Sunni Arab neighbors, caught in cross hairs of sectarianism in the wake of the \u201ccoalition of the willing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last Girl\u201d is also a primer on the ancient Yazidi faith that sustains Murad throughout her ordeal: its creation myths, visions of the afterlife and idiosyncratic customs. (Many Yazidis avoid eating lettuce, and consider blue a color too holy for humans to wear.) Yazidis pray to Tawusi Melek, an archangel who, at the creation, took the form of a peacock, and painted a desolate earth with the colors of his feathers. Over the centuries, misunderstandings surrounding the mysterious religion have fueled genocide \u2014 73 times, Murad writes, a figure eerily exact. According to a pernicious myth, Tawusi Melek refused to bow before Adam and was condemned to hell, echoing Satan\u2019s behavior in the Quran. Branding them \u201cdevil worshipers,\u201d ISIS legitimized the massacre and enslavement of Yazidis, singling them out among Iraq\u2019s many minorities for particularly inhumane treatment.\n\n\u201cI want to be the last girl in the world with a story like mine,\u201d Murad concludes. Despite recent gains against ISIS in Iraq, many Yazidis still remain in captivity. As a story that hasn\u2019t yet ended, \u201cThe Last Girl\u201d is difficult to process. It is a call to action, but as it places Murad\u2019s tragedy in the larger narrative of Iraqi history and American intervention, it leaves the reader with urgent, incendiary questions: What have we done, and what can we do?", "title": "When Rape Becomes a Weapon of War", "authors": ["Anna Della Subin", "Nadia Murad"]}

Among the T-shirts banned by the law, Judge Shepherd said, were ones promoting the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National Rifle Association, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the N.A.A.C.P.\n\nThe state has an important precedent on its side.\n\nIn a 1992 decision, Burson v. Freeman, the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that created a 100-foot buffer zone around polling places. But that law was aimed at traditional campaign signs and posters, not apparel bearing more general messages.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the Tennessee law. Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a four-member plurality, said it was needed to combat \u201cvoter intimidation and election fraud.\u201d\n\nLaws like the one in Tennessee are fairly easy to enforce. The Minnesota law, and similar ones in at least nine other states, require difficult on-the-spot judgments about what apparel qualifies as political. Those decisions, moreover, are often made by temporary poll workers rather than seasoned government officials.\n\nSuch workers can make odd calls. In 2012, a young woman wearing an M.I.T. sweatshirt was stopped by a confused Denver poll worker who thought she was electioneering on behalf of Mitt Romney, a presidential candidate.\n\nA supervisor intervened, explaining that the initials on the shirt stood for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cThere was only one \u2018T,\u2019 so the voter was not electioneering,\u201d Alton Dillard, a spokesman for the Denver Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office, explained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother poll worker tried to stop a Houston woman from voting in the 2008 election because she was wearing an Alaska T-shirt. Sarah Palin, then the state\u2019s governor, was running for vice president.\n\nAgain, cooler heads prevailed.\n\nSimilar problems have arisen in the Supreme Court\u2019s backyard. A few years ago, I saw a court police officer order a man wearing a \u201cGuns Save Lives\u201d button on the Supreme Court plaza to remove it.\n\n\u201cNo political logos on the plaza,\u201d an officer said.\n\nI asked the officer for his reasoning. \u201cYou can\u2019t interview people on the plaza,\u201d he responded.\n\nHe was part of a long tradition. A Supreme Court police officer once threatened a woman with arrest for displaying a sign bearing the verbatim text of the First Amendment.\n\nWhether at a polling place or on the Supreme Court plaza, decorum is a worthy goal.

It was inspired, in part, by the 2008 death of his father, Franklin H. Epstein, an academic physician, from brain cancer at 84.\n\nIn the weeks after his father\u2019s disease had been diagnosed, Mr. Epstein said, \u201cI realized that I had never had a direct conversation with him about any of what I had learned from Buddhism. He was proud of me as a doctor and liked my books, but he wasn\u2019t drawn to it. But then I thought, \u2018Oh no, he\u2019s going to die and I\u2019ve never even really tried to convey what\u2019s helped me about anticipating death from meditation, from Buddhism.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat worry drove Mr. Epstein to pick up the phone and call his father. It was also the first germ for the contents and the title of \u201cAdvice Not Given,\u201d in which he offers counsel that he might previously have kept to himself. \u201cThis stuff has helped me so much, I don\u2019t want to be withholding it\u201d from patients \u201cout of some sense of not being too pushy,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Epstein, 64, lives in TriBeCa with his wife, the sculptor Arlene Shechet, and he sees patients in the same building, in the unassuming basement office in which we spoke on a frigid afternoon in late December. The office\u2019s walls, a pale blue, are unadorned. Mr. Epstein\u2019s desk and the books that surround it are tucked away from the uncluttered space in which he sits with patients.\n\nMr. Epstein, who has had his private practice since 1986, was in his teens when he first felt drawn to the spiritual and professional paths he would pursue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome young men join rock bands to meet young women. Mr. Epstein took an introduction to world religions class. His romantic interest in one particular classmate at Harvard didn\u2019t last, but he fell for some lines in a book of Buddhist scripture called the Dhammapada. \u201cThere was a verse, something like: \u2018Look to your mind, wise man \u2014 it is subtle, invisible, treacherous,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThere were \u201clittle bits of Buddhism floating around\u201d at Harvard in those days, Mr. Epstein said, as the age of psychedelia gave way to the age of consciousness studies. He befriended fellow travelers, including Daniel Goleman, later a science writer for The Times who was then a graduate student and teaching fellow. Mr. Goleman had visited India to study meditation. \u201cI knew he knew something that I wanted to know,\u201d Mr. Epstein said. \u201cMostly, he was wearing these purple bell-bottom pants that I thought were really cool.\u201d\n\nMr. Epstein flashes a sense of humor with some frequency in person, one that mischievously cuts against the soberly reflective presence you might expect from the books (and that you also get). He has the wiry frame of a regular yoga practitioner, and an enviable thicket of gray hair. You might feel torn, sitting across from him, between asking for advice on how to cope with the transient nature of reality and for advice on high-quality conditioning products.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn person he is gentle and insightful in a quiet and humorous way,\u201d said Robert Thurman, an expert on Tibetan Buddhism and a professor at Columbia University, in an email interview. Mr. Thurman is a longtime friend of Mr. Epstein, and has taught and lectured alongside him. \u201cPeople are automatically drawn to him, wishing they had a shrink like that. Other shrinks also seek him out in personal workshops, and I think tend to emulate him.\u201d\n\nDespite his gentle disposition, Mr. Epstein is tough-minded. \u201cPeople expect too much from meditation,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t peddle a version of Buddhist insight for Westerners eager to utilize it for quick-acting self-help or self-actualization. As he wrote in \u201cGoing to Pieces Without Falling Apart\u201d (1998): \u201cWhat I had learned from Buddhism was that I did not have to know myself analytically as much as I had to tolerate not knowing.\u201d\n\nThe problem with the ego, according to Mr. Epstein, is that it wants so badly to know. \u201cThe ego comes into being when we\u2019re two or three or four years old,\u201d he said, \u201cjust feeling our own separateness and how difficult it is to navigate the external pressures from parents and teachers, and the internal pressures of one\u2019s biology, one\u2019s drives and so on. The ego wants security and stability and coherence. It\u2019s rooted in the intellect, so it tells stories. It fastens on to the first stories that start to make sense, both positive and negative.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The classic stubborn story dealt with in therapy, he said, can be summarized in four words: \u201cThe problem is me.\u201d And the low self-esteem reinforced by such stories \u201cis as much ego as the puffed-up, \u2018I\u2019m the best,\u2019 competitive, American way we ordinarily think of the ego.\u201d\n\nDespite his good shape (and his good genes; his mother, Sherrie Epstein, is 93), Mr. Epstein, in the middle of his seventh decade, is not far from the phase of life about which he counseled his father. Asked how he feels about the prospect of his own ultimate impermanence \u2014 death, to the rest of us \u2014 Mr. Epstein said with a laugh: \u201cI feel frightened about ultimate impermanence. But with a little bit of a sense of humor, somehow. There\u2019s something a little bit exciting, even within all the fear, about literally not knowing what\u2019s going to come next.\u201d\n\nAnd what did he tell his father about what comes next?\n\n\u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know if you want to hear this or not, but I don\u2019t want to keep it from you either,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Epstein recalls saying. \u201c \u2018You know that place in yourself that hasn\u2019t really changed subjectively from when you were a young man, or 20, 40, 60, 80? You still sort of feel the same to yourself inside, but if you try to find that place you can\u2019t really put your finger on it?\u2019 \u201d He then told his father what he believed he had learned about how to relax the mind into that \u201cinvisible space where you are who you\u2019ve always been\u201d as the body fades away. \u201cHe was very nice.

It all started back in May, when the Mavericks made a public show of their interest in Ntilikina, a French teenager, and were thus widely expected to select him at No. 9.\n\nThe team did little to mask the troop of scouts it sent in to see Ntilikina play for his French club (SIG Strasbourg) in May. The delegation featured Donnie Nelson, the president of basketball operations, and his top aide, Tony Ronzone. Cuban then traveled to Italy to have breakfast with Ntilikina in June at a pre-draft camp in Treviso and posed with the lanky guard for a photograph that quickly circulated.\n\nWhen it subsequently emerged that the Mavericks had arranged for Vincent Collet, Ntilikina\u2019s club coach at Strasbourg and the coach of the France national team, to become the head coach of their summer-league squad in Las Vegas in July, Dallas appeared to be going to extremes to welcome Ntilikina to North Texas.\n\nYet it was all something of a ruse. That whole time Dallas was growing infatuated with Smith, a 6-foot-3 North Carolina State freshman, despite well-publicized concerns about a knee injury he had suffered in high school and whispers of selfishness and moodiness when the Wolfpack struggled. With Nowitzki, the future Hall of Fame big man, heading into his 20th season and the Mavericks openly desperate for new players to build around, Smith became the preference because of a perceived higher ceiling.\n\nSo when Jackson, in the last major move of his rocky three-year tenure as the Knicks\u2019 president, leaned on his long-held fondness for big guards and took Ntilikina with the eighth pick, Cuban and his staff celebrated in the Dallas draft room at a pitch unrivaled since the Mavericks\u2019 championship season of 2010-11.\n\nThe club seems even giddier about its draft pick after having him for a half-season. The Mavericks market Smith, 20, and his uber-athleticism as aggressively as they promote Nowitzki, with confidence that Smith\u2019s recent triple-double against New Orleans was merely a glimpse of the future.", "title": "When the Knicks Visit Dallas, Only One Thing Will Be Missing", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "The word \u201cgentrification\u201d was coined almost offhandedly in 1964, by the British sociologist Ruth Glass, in an essay about postwar London. Looking around her, she saw a city becoming more modern and affluent. This came with certain ills: Commutes were getting longer, traffic worse, middle-class jobs more specialized (\u201cproject engineer\u201d; \u201csystem analyst\u201d) and menial ones more scarce. And something striking was happening in the working-class parts of town. They were being \u201cinvaded by the middle classes \u2014 upper and lower.\u201d These newcomers were buying up the \u201cshabby, modest mews and cottages\u201d and turning them into \u201celegant, expensive residences.\u201d \u201cOnce this process of \u2018gentrification\u2019 starts in a district,\u201d Glass writes, \u201cit goes on rapidly until all or most of the working-class occupiers are displaced, and the whole social character of the district is changed.\u201d\n\nHer coinage contained within it an ambiguity that persists to this day. The root of \u201cgentrification\u201d \u2014 \u201cgentry\u201d \u2014 can refer either to those of not-quite-aristocratic birth or to those who profit from land ownership; either to the well-off in general or to the rentier class in particular. This lack of clarity is fitting: In a gentrifying neighborhood, title to the land is transferred first in the literal sense and then in the spiritual one, as local businesses and institutions change to serve the tastes of wealthier arrivals. To use \u201cgentrification\u201d to describe lifestyle trends is to focus on that second step rather than the first one \u2014 to focus on class signifiers instead of class itself.\n\nLast year, the academics Jason Patch, John Joe Schlichtman and Marc Lamont Hill published a book about gentrification that examined their own roles in the process, branding themselves right in the title: \u201cGentrifier.\u201d This is another fascinating new twist on Glass\u2019s term. After all, Britain\u2019s rigid class system made it easy enough for her to clearly identify the people doing the gentrifying: It was the gentry. Here in the States, though, we\u2019ve adopted a novel word meaning \u201cone who gentrifies\u201d \u2014 the active colonist, someone who tries on neighborhoods like shirts at a thrift shop. This turns gentrification into a lifestyle choice. Hence the scores of listicles that have cropped up on websites that cater to well-meaning millennials, working either to steer the budding gentrifier in a noble direction (Thought Catalog\u2019s \u201c10 Rules for Being a Good Gentrifier From an Urban Planner in Brooklyn\u201d) or to suggest that she might avoid the epithet while still participating in the process (AlterNet\u2019s \u201c20 Ways Not to Be a Gentrifier\u201d). Invariably these articles suggest shopping locally, talking to your neighbors and, above all, being self-aware about your impact. Befriending your bodega guy is a great thing to do, but it\u2019s of limited assistance when the landlord triples his rent.\n\nIf the logic of conscious consumerism has come to infect what we mean by \u201cgentrification,\u201d perhaps it\u2019s because the process always begins with people who are expected to know better: the \u201ccreative class.\u201d In a 1979 book called \u201cNeighborhood Renewal,\u201d the urban theorist Phillip L. Clay outlined four stages of gentrification: In the first, \u201cpioneers\u201d \u2014 often bohemians and artists \u2014 move to dilapidated or abandoned areas in search of cheaper rents; in the second, the middle classes follow; in the third, their numbers displace the original population; and in the final stage, the neighborhood is fully turned over to banks, developers and the wealthy. By this point, the artists are being priced out to another subway stop or another city \u2014 where they will be greeted as though they\u2019ve come seeking adventure.\n\nBut the journalist Peter Moskowitz, in the 2017 book \u201cHow to Kill a City,\u201d suggests a fifth stage should be added to Clay\u2019s list, so we can accommodate arrangements like those in Midtown Manhattan, where multimillion-dollar condominiums are built and sold to shell corporations, presumably owned by foreign billionaires, and often left vacant. \u201cThe fifth and last phase of gentrification,\u201d he writes, \u201cis when neighborhoods aren\u2019t just more friendly to capital than to people but cease being places to live a normal life.\u201d New York\u2019s skyline is erupting with buildings like these \u2014 stacks of cash-stuffed mattresses teetering in the wind. And The Times reported last year that the West Village\u2019s Bleecker Street had fallen victim to \u201chigh-rent blight,\u201d with commercial space becoming so expensive ($45,000 a month) that even Marc Jacobs couldn\u2019t keep his stores open; shops that once catered to the wealthy now sit empty, waiting for a tenant who can foot the bill. When the heist is done and it\u2019s time to split the loot, capital snuffs out culture.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s culture \u2014 and its perceived appropriation \u2014 that has ingrained itself in the way we think about gentrification. It\u2019s almost as though, in the face of unstoppable, invisible forces, we\u2019ve grabbed hold of what we can see and control. Investors could buy and sell every building on your block without your ever noticing, but the coffee shop where the staff is mean to everybody is right in front of you. All the while, global flows of capital course through your metropolis, wearing down every bump and cranny. They will continue until the day it\u2019s finally as smooth and featureless as a river rock \u2014 and you\u2019re shopping around for a reasonably cozy van.", "title": "When \u2018Gentrification\u2019 Isn\u2019t About Housing", "authors": ["Willy Staley", "First Words"]}

{"date": "2018-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Hamoud and Ms. Labaki belong to a long line of women in Arab cinema. One of the most surprising things for me when I began to study the history of Arab cinema was how far back women\u2019s contributions to the medium goes. Since the early days of cinema in the Middle East, women have been active participants onscreen and behind the scenes. In the 1920s and \u201930s, women served as studio executives, writers and producers. In the 1970s and \u201980s, a number of the groundbreaking auteur filmmakers were women. The subjects that Ms. Hamoud and Ms. Labaki are taking on might seem pioneering and progressive, but in fact the previous generation of female directors tackled many of them.\n\nTake, for instance, the works of the Lebanese trio Heiny Srour, Randa Chahal Sabbag and Jocelyne Saab. Ms. Srour\u2019s first and only feature film, \u201cLeila and the Wolves\u201d (1984), spotlighted women\u2019s active participation in the wars in Israel-Palestine and Lebanon, both as facilitators and combatants, all the while touching on hot buttons such as honor killings, abusive marriages, the stigma of divorce and educations curtailed because of forced marriages. Ms. Srour was also the first Arab woman to have a film selected for Cannes (in 1974, for a documentary).\n\nSet and shot amid the Lebanese civil war, Ms. Saab\u2019s feature debut, \u201cA Suspended Life\u201d (1984), follows Samar, an independent-minded young girl reveling in the freedom afforded by warfare chaos. She thinks herself \u2014 and proclaims herself \u2014 \u201cfree\u201d and able to \u201cdo whatever I want,\u201d but the cost of her spirited wandering is a hymen-restoring operation imposed by her family.\n\nMs. Sabbag, who died in 2008, was equally provocative. Her early films include \u201cSand Screens\u201d (1991), a drama centering on a woman determined to lead an uninhibited life in a deeply conservative society, and the sarcastically titled \u201cA Civilized People\u201d (1999), which touches on such discomfiting topics as homosexuality, the ill treatment of immigrant house servants and religious acrimony in Lebanese society. (The Lebanese government banned the film.)\n\nMs. Srour, Ms. Saab and Ms. Sabbag are among the women featured in Rebecca Hillauer\u2019s \u201cEncyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers.\u201d Ms. Hillauer notes in the preface that the book started with an investigation into the question \u201cArab women filmmakers \u2014 do they exist?\u201d By the time she completed her research, she had enough material to expand what she had conceived as a small reference work into a tome of some 400 pages, covering women from Iraq to Egypt to Tunisia.", "title": "Opinion | Where Can Women Make Movies?

If not, why not?\n\nEach year, The Times Travel section publishes a list of \u201c52 Places to Go.\u201d Here are a few of the destinations the editors suggest visiting in 2018:\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nThere is no city in the world like New Orleans. Influences from Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and indigenous peoples have made it the ultimate melting pot. And that diversity expresses itself in a multitude of ways that define New Orleans in the American imagination: music, food, language, and on and on. Though it\u2019s been a long recovery from Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans isn\u2019t just back on its feet, it is as vibrant as ever \u2014 particularly impressive for a 300-year-old. Colombia\n\nAfter over a half-century of civil war coming to a close, Colombia is eager to become the adventurous, cosmopolitan hot spot it deserves to be. While much work is needed to integrate former rebels back into society, foreign tourism rose 250 percent during the past decade. In the pulsating capital of Bogot\u00e1, dozens of luxe hotel chains have opened, while the food scene has gotten a boost from spots like Leonor Espinosa\u2019s restaurant Leo. Elsewhere, you will find coffee fincas turned into luxury hotels, eco-resorts on isolated desert peninsulas and colonial buildings transformed into spa retreats. Once off-limit attractions like Pacific Coast rain forests and the rainbow-color river Ca\u00f1o Cristales are now in every guidebook. Basilicata, Italy\n\nThis is a chance to visit Italy\u2019s southern region before the world catches on. Between the heel that is Puglia and the toe that is Calabria, you will find Basilicata, the arch of Italy\u2019s foot. Despite a storied and ancient past, the region has been overlooked in modern times. Easily Italy\u2019s best-kept secret, Basilicata is revered for beautiful beaches, ancient towns and a dearth of organized crime. In 2019, the town of Matera, a Unesco site, will host the European Capital of Culture. It is also known for its ancient caves \u2014 once used for livestock, later as primitive homes, and today, as private residences and hipster, beautifully restored, Flintstone-esque hotels. But for now at least, the secret is still safe. The Caribbean\n\nHurricanes Irma and Maria delivered a one-two punch to the Caribbean in 2017, battering many islands, including Dominica, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin and the United States Virgin Islands. While more than 70 percent of the tourism-dependent region was unaffected, hoteliers and tourism agencies across the islands banded together to help their neighbors and spread the word that business for one means survival for all.\n\nFor the first time this year, The Times has hired a travel writer to visit all 52 places on the list and write about them. The Travel editor received over 13,000 applications for the job from an amazing variety of people, from a father-daughter team to a best-selling author.", "title": "Where Do You Want to Travel?", "authors": []}

Instead, their knowledge is, more often than not, based on a scattered bone or tooth. Footprints have been found before, but usually a single impression on a stray piece of rock.\n\nHere, there are pairs of prints that show the left and right feet of the mammal in a sitting position. The scientists gave to these prints the name of Sederipes goddardensis, which \u201cliterally means sitting footprint,\u201d Dr. Lockley said.\n\nDr. Lockley said this was one of only two known sites where dozens of dinosaur-era mammal footprints had been found.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJohn Foster, executive director of the Museum of Moab in Utah, who was not involved in the research, said the findings were \u201cvery interesting to me, especially the mammal tracks and what they show about structure and probable behavior.\u201d\n\nThe discovery was made by serendipity and almost lost forever.\n\nRay Stanford, an amateur paleontologist who has become an expert on dinosaur tracks, had just dropped off his wife, Sheila, who worked at Goddard, after the two went for lunch in 2012.\n\nA few years earlier on the grounds of Goddard, Mr. Stanford had come across a loose rock with the footprint of a small three-toed theropod, and the brownish stone was the type of iron-rich sedimentary material that often preserves such prints.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs he was leaving the parking lot, he noticed rock of a similar color sticking out of the grass on a hill about 90 feet away. Mr. Stanford stopped the car and went to take a look, and spotted a prominent dinosaur footprint. \u201cLo and behold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect large nodosaur. This one was beautiful. I was in ecstasy as a tracker.\u201d\n\nBut there was a problem. Goddard was about to rip up the parking lot and the hill and put a $31 million office building there. Officials called Compton J. Tucker, a Goddard scientist who has participated in geophysical surveys to find buried ruins at archaeological sites. Dr. Tucker recalled that as he listened, he thought, \u201cThis sounds kind of strange but it sounds interesting.\u201d\n\nAdditional examination revealed the baby nodosaur\u2019s footsteps and the sauropod print at the other end of the slab.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Then an army of volunteers dug up those areas. But none of the other pieces turned out to be as interesting as the one Mr. Stanford had first spotted.\n\nStephen Godfrey, curator of paleontology at the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons, Md., cleaned the rock and made a fiberglass cast of it. A couple of years later, the cast ended up in Mr. Stanford\u2019s basement, where he took a more careful and closer look.\n\nHe spotted the tracks of the four small theropods, all headed in the same direction, walking slowly. \u201cWhy were the theropods walking slowly?\u201d Mr. Stanford said. \u201cThese things were moving at less than half a mile per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe then saw the steps of the mammals. \u201cThis was the real thing that hit me for a loop,\u201d Mr. Stanford said. \u201cTo see them with their potential predators.\u201d\n\nDr. Lockley came to Maryland about a year ago and stayed with Mr. Stanford to pore over the slab. After 80 footprints had been mapped, Mr. Stanford thought he was done. Then his wife walked up behind him, and pointed out a pterosaur footprint he had missed. She is a co-author on the paper.\n\nNone of the footprints on the slab overlap, indicating that the animals all passed in a short period of time, perhaps over a few hours or days, not likely more than a week or two. The patterns are suggestive of what each animal was doing, but it is impossible to know for certain that the dinosaurs were hunting the mammals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a possibility,\u201d Dr. Lockley said.\n\nMore Reporting on Paleontology\n\nThe hill is now gone.

{"date": "2018-01-04 00:00:00", "text": "Applying for a Safe Harbor checking account is an invasive procedure. The credit union first tries to learn as much as it can about the company and its owners, beginning with an hourlong interview, followed by the document collection that Behzadzadeh found so aggravating: lists of owners, investors, vendors and customers; financial statements and tax forms; the business\u2019s organizing documents; state licenses; leases, handbooks and more. The documents can multiply quickly, because marijuana businesses are often a web of affiliated companies with overlapping ownership. Each often gets its own bank account.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce the accounts are opened, Safe Harbor\u2019s bankers inspect the business and its premises as frequently as every three months, to confirm that it hews to all of Colorado\u2019s rules. Treasury\u2019s guidance implies that a bank can\u2019t properly make sure that a client stays on the right side of the Cole memo without a rigorous state licensing and regulatory plan in place, according to McVay, the Seattle lawyer. This, he says, explains why California\u2019s large medical-marijuana sector mostly lacks access to banking services: Local governments oversee the business, and with a very light touch. The state won\u2019t implement comprehensive regulations until later this year at the earliest.\n\nSafe Harbor bankers spend most of their time monitoring client transactions, tying every dollar the bank takes in to a legitimate sale and making sure that no dollar withdrawn disappears into the illicit economy. Each month, they reconcile the account activity to a company\u2019s ledger and the sales it reports, as well as to all the other information they\u2019ve gleaned about a client, such as which companies it normally trades with. The credit union has compiled reams of data about how money moves around the marijuana industry, and bankers regularly compare notes about the transactions they see. When an unusual deposit arrives \u2014 larger than typical, say, or from a new source \u2014 the banker holds the money until the client can account for it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSeefried recalls how a banker noticed that one dispensary seemed to have customers with unusually deep pockets: its sales averaged $300 to $400 each, while medical-marijuana patients generally spend less than $100 at dispensaries. The banker interrogated the client and, from the parking lot, even staked out the dispensary and studied its customers. In the end, still mystified by how the dispensary made its money, Safe Harbor closed the account. \u201cYou cannot bank what you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Seefried says.\n\nSafe Harbor has closed three other accounts after members broke various credit-union rules, indicating that they weren\u2019t willing to be fully transparent with their bankers. Late last summer, Seefried ejected three more members after bankers, working with money-laundering experts, detected suspicious activity. And another three closed their accounts rather than comply with her increasingly strict requirements, including one that customers deposit 90 percent of their receipts. The rule, she acknowledges, was mainly intended to weed out less-committed clients: Only a business trying to hide its transactions would be put off by it.\n\nLast June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s federal regulator, conducted its annual examination of the credit union\u2019s books and practices, and for the third year in a row, had no complaints about Safe Harbor. Today the program consists of 13 people, including five responsible solely for compliance. Most are women. (Women manage more than half of all credit unions.) When Seefried hires bankers for Partner Colorado, she gravitates toward sociable people. For Safe Harbor, she says she prefers introverts or, at the very least, people who evince precision and curiosity.\n\nThis sort of meticulous banking isn\u2019t cheap. For each $100,000 deposited at Safe Harbor, a client pays $450 in fees in the first year and $300 thereafter. (Client companies that serve the marijuana industry but don\u2019t actually sell the drugs, like laboratories, require much less vetting and so pay much lower fees.) Seefried says the Safe Harbor program made a modest profit in its first year \u2014 less than $200,000. It became much more lucrative for the credit union in 2016, but Seefried won\u2019t reveal specifics. According to federal data, most of the institution\u2019s sources of income have stayed relatively steady since 2014, but fee income has grown to a projected $5 million in 2017 from nearly $3 million.\n\nSeefried says that about three-quarters of Safe Harbor\u2019s marijuana-selling clients pay less than $1,000 a month per account, considerably less than they would pay at banks, where monthly account fees are said to start at $1,500. Many observers assume that the opportunity to assess lucrative fees is what entices small banks to take on these risky accounts. Federal data show that at Champion Bank, in suburban Denver, which began explicitly working with marijuana businesses in 2014, annual fee revenue on deposit accounts increased by a factor of 68 from 2013 to 2016, to $752,000 from $11,000, even as its main line of business, providing loans, shrank. At Colorado Bank and Trust in La Junta, fees grew elevenfold to $2.9 million.\n\nFor marijuana businesses, engaging with the financial mainstream has kept them mostly free from legal trouble. Safe Harbor has received subpoenas for the bank records of only four of the just over 200 clients it has had. None has yet been indicted. John Walsh can recall prosecuting one case against regulated dispensaries and none against a business serving the industry. But working without a checking account makes even an otherwise law-abiding business look evasive, says Lewis Koski, who served as the first director of the state\u2019s Marijuana Enforcement Division, which collects marijuana taxes and regulates the industry, before he joined Andrew Freedman in a consulting venture. A cash-management technique like personal deposits structured to evade notice can legally amount to money laundering. \u201cBanking,\u201d Koski says, \u201cjust provides a really clear picture of where money is coming in and where money is going out.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the last Wednesday of last March, Kim Oliver, Partner Colorado\u2019s executive vice president, pulled her old, mud-streaked silver Jetta into Avicenna\u2019s parking lot. She had come from her ranch, east of Denver. She was dressed formally and seemed intently focused on the business at hand. Seefried had reviewed all of Behzadzadeh\u2019s paperwork; now only an inspection stood between him and a bank account. Behzadzadeh gave Oliver a warm welcome, and Elsberg took her ID, signed her in and gave her a visitor badge. Oliver made a mental note: the first small compliance test, passed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOliver, who is 59, has worked in credit unions all her adult life. Earlier she had confided to me a lifelong hostility to marijuana and rage when she discovered that her son-in-law, a veteran suffering from PTSD and living in her house, was cultivating a small crop in her basement. But working on Safe Harbor had forced her to reconsider her views on medical marijuana. \u201cI found out that he wasn\u2019t blowing smoke,\u201d she told me. (I couldn\u2019t tell if she intended the pun.) \u201cThat was my whole thing: You\u2019re just trying to have an excuse to smoke dope.\u201d She now supplies her arthritic mother with topical creams that contain cannabidiol, a chemical compound in the marijuana flower that doesn\u2019t produce a high but that medical-marijuana advocates believe reduces inflammation.\n\nOliver sat down with Behzadzadeh and Elsberg at a gray marble table in the kitchenette just inside the employee entrance. She began the formal inspection by going through a checklist: six pages long, scores of questions. The first series delved into Behzadzadeh\u2019s financial practices and the second into business procedures. These were meant to assess Behzadzadeh\u2019s compliance with state regulations. Then she read five or six questions about each of the eight Cole memo priorities. After a response, Oliver made a check \u2014 almost always \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 and sometimes wrote a little note beside it. \u201cIf you had an employee, and they cut a bud off,\u201d she asked at one point, \u201chow would you catch who did that?\u201d\n\n\u201cCut a bud off\u201d \u2014 the phrase in Oliver\u2019s Great Plains twang was disorienting. One of the incongruities in Colorado\u2019s marijuana business is how professionals new to the trade adopt the Mendocino idiom without either irony or any particular reverence, the way their clothes absorb the plant\u2019s scent after a few hours on site. The industry\u2019s brand-builders prefer more sanitized language when talking to the public: \u201cadult use\u201d for \u201crecreational\u201d and \u201ccannabis\u201d for \u201cmarijuana.\u201d\n\nElsberg replied, \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it \u2014 we have cameras on everything.\u201d The questions, and especially the answers, occasionally delved into minutiae, as when Behzadzadeh noted that he had hired a man to drive the perimeter of his two buildings hourly every night. Oliver raised an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s legal,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. \u201cI checked his sosh\u201d \u2014 Social Security number. \u201cI checked his driver\u2019s license.\u201d He deadpanned, \u201cI sent a copy to Jeff Sessions, too.\u201d\n\nNext, Oliver went about documenting compliance, snapping photos of the cameras, the safes, the locks on cabinets and other equipment, the bars blocking the windows and even the eyewash station. She walked over to a bakery-bun rack and photographed the RFID tag lying next to a brittle sheet of an extract known as shatter. Then she had an employee type the tag number into the state record system to call up that batch\u2019s history. She visited the grow next door (\u201cI\u2019m surprised they have as many cameras that they do,\u201d she remarked approvingly afterward) and then followed Behzadzadeh and Elsberg up to the dispensary in Federal Heights.\n\nThe dispensary inspection got off to a rocky start when Oliver noticed the A.T.M. near the entrance. Cash-machine companies often rent them to dispensaries and stores, because so few can accept credit cards, but Behzadzadeh owned his and each week filled it with $2,000 in cash taken from the register. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change,\u201d Oliver said matter-of-factly. \u201cThe biggest way of laundering money is through the A.T.M.\u201d\n\nBehzadzadeh\u2019s machine was tied to a personal bank account; every time a customer withdrew cash, that account received a credit. But the register money was unaccounted for; it could come from anywhere. Now, Oliver told him, he would have to withdraw money from Safe Harbor and hire an armored car to deliver the cash and fill the A.T.M.; he couldn\u2019t even touch it himself.\n\nA look of incredulity crossed Behzadzadeh\u2019s face. \u201cWait \u2014 I\u2019m not going to give my business to somebody else!\u201d he said. As a start-up entrepreneur, Behzadzadeh nursed a swelling grudge against the contractors and vendors who nickeled and dimed him, he thought, at every turn \u2014 maybe even Safe Harbor. The cost of banking was one thing, but the prospect of trading the satchel for an armored car from a company like Blue Line, another niche player that charged a premium in a niche industry, especially galled him. \u201cI have no problem doing business with you guys, and I appreciate the banking, but I\u2019m not going to pay Blue Line to take my money,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOliver kept pressing. \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is loading the machine for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I wanted to be on the black market, I would come in here and fill this machine all the time to clean the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Behzadzadeh said. Now he understood. He thought out loud: He would bring cash from Avicenna to the dispensary and give it to a courier, who would put different cash, which he had brought with him, into the A.T.M. \u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that\u201d \u2014 Behzadzadeh addressed the imaginary courier \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll make you coffee.\u201d\n\nBehzadzadeh\u2019s dogs were barking ferociously when he and his wife returned home from dinner late one night in September. They didn\u2019t think anything of it, but several hours later, the couple heard noises in their house. Behzadzadeh gathered his wife and children in a bedroom and raced downstairs with a laser-sighted pistol. But the intruders were gone, along with his cellphone \u2014 and the satchel.\n\nThe robbery could have been a financial disaster. A month earlier, the Denver Fire Department had determined that the extraction room at Avicenna was not sufficiently blastproof, shutting down the factory for two months. \u201cIf they had taken $30,000 or $40,000,\u201d Behzadzadeh said, \u201cit would have literally broken my back.\u201d But the satchel held no money that night. Behzadzadeh had opened his bank accounts the morning after the inspection. It had taken him a few months to fully embrace them \u2014 Seefried had predicted as much \u2014 but now around two-thirds of his trading partners also accept or write checks. What cash remains in Behzadzadeh\u2019s business waits in safes, secured to the floor, for the armored truck.\n\nYet despite Safe Harbor\u2019s efforts and those of its competitors, bank accounts remain out of reach for many Colorado marijuana companies. The high fees put off smaller businesses at the same time as banks seem to be pulling back. Seefried didn\u2019t want Safe Harbor deposits to swamp the credit union, so last January she reduced the number of new monthly clients from five to three and then closed the door altogether in August after deposits ballooned over the summer. As the state Marijuana Enforcement Division granted licenses to about 220 additional companies last year through November, Safe Harbor\u2019s waiting list swelled to 96 businesses, or two-and-a-half-years\u2019 worth of new clients, before the credit union stopped adding names to it. The five banks have become very stingy about granting new accounts, according to three C.P.A.s who have marijuana-industry clients. The parent company of one of those institutions, Colorado National Bank, declared bankruptcy in November, putting its future as a marijuana banker in doubt.\n\nMarijuana banking has always depended entirely on forbearance from Washington, and the Trump administration seems decidedly less tolerant than its predecessor. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared before a gathering of law-enforcement officials that marijuana is \u201conly slightly less awful\u201d than heroin. \u201cI reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,\u201d he said. A task force assembled in February by the Justice Department to combat violent crime didn\u2019t recommend any changes to the Cole memo when it delivered its initial findings last summer, but the agency is very likely revising it. (The Justice Department wouldn\u2019t comment on its deliberations.) [Update: After this article went to press, the Justice Department rescinded the Cole memo, giving U.S. attorneys more latitude to enforce federal marijuana laws in their districts.]\n\nSeefried had hoped to begin making loans to and processing credit-card transactions for Safe Harbor\u2019s existing clients, but for the foreseeable future, she has put those plans on hold. Until federal law catches up to public sentiment, marijuana banking is unlikely to keep pace with the industry \u2014 the vetting is too expensive. Just last month, after a client was caught up in a police investigation, Safe Harbor had to review the account to make sure bankers hadn\u2019t missed any suspicious activity. \u201cIt cost me $30,000: $20,000 to bring in investigators for three days and $10,000 for legal fees,\u201d Seefried told me. \u201cThat\u2019s one client, with one problem.\u201d She plans to raise fees in the next couple months.\n\nYet she still hopes to position Safe Harbor as a model for banking the marijuana industry elsewhere. In November, Safe Harbor began licensing its name and protocols to financial institutions nationwide. Six banks and credit unions in six states will begin taking on customers this month, including a credit union in Colorado to serve the customers that Safe Harbor no longer can. Three more will join each quarter. Safe Harbor is also testing a mobile-phone app for buying marijuana in Hawaii\u2019s handful of state-licensed dispensaries.\n\nIn June, the National Credit Union Association, Partner Colorado\u2019s regulator, advised Seefried that it would begin examining the institution quarterly rather than yearly, which she attributes to the national expansion. She has hired two full-time employees just to manage the increased compliance. \u201cWe are bringing more credit unions to the table, and they don\u2019t want us teaching them incorrectly,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne industry investment facilitator, the Arcview Group, estimates that legal marijuana sales in the United States will more than double to roughly $21 billion by 2021 from nearly $9 billion last year. Walsh, the former prosecutor, has concluded that the tension between the federal government and liberalizing states is unsustainable. \u201cI came in as U.S. attorney in 2010 assuming that it was my job to enforce the federal marijuana laws regardless of what state legalization efforts would look like,\u201d he says. \u201cThe longer I worked on the issue, and we struggled with it, the more I realized that a simple shut-it-down approach was not practical.

In a bulletin released last May, the F.B.I. reported that white supremacist groups were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016, \u201cmore than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s report highlighted cases in which the offender entered through the diversity lottery or because of family ties to legal immigrants, but the White House official could not say what proportion of people in each of those categories had been convicted of terrorism.\n\nDemocrats and civil liberties groups, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called the report flawed and politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThis misleading report relies on manufactured data to perpetuate a myth that immigrants \u2014 specifically, those from Muslim countries \u2014 are dangerous elements within our country,\u201d Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrats on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, said in a joint statement. \u201cThe administration then uses these falsehoods as reasoning and license for policies that promote the continued abuse of our rights and civil liberties.\u201d\n\nThe report was drawn up to comply with an executive order that Mr. Trump issued in March to ban foreigners from six predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The order, which has since expired and been replaced with a new travel ban, required the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to collect and publicly release information on the number of foreign nationals in the United States who had been charged with terrorism-related offenses.\n\nDrawing on a Justice Department database, the report found that at least 549 individuals had been convicted of international terrorism-related charges in federal courts between Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nA homeland security analysis said 402 of those, or about 73 percent, were foreign-born. That included 254 who were not American citizens, 148 who were naturalized and became citizens and 147 who were citizens by birth.", "title": "White House Fuels Immigration Debate With Terrorism Statistics", "authors": []}

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\nAll right, I thought, then it must be the one that is eating.\n\nWrong again.\n\nI went on to guess every wolf except the alpha. Turns out, the alpha wolf can usually be found sleeping. Sleeping. Didn\u2019t it need to bark and growl and intimidate people to show everyone that it was the alpha? No; overcompensating is more of a people thing. Ages ago, I read somewhere, probably in a self-help book I bought after a nasty breakup, that truly powerful beings don\u2019t need to prove how powerful they are. This made no sense to me until I saw it in action with the wolves. When you\u2019re truly in control, you don\u2019t need to tap on people\u2019s shoulders constantly to remind them how in control you are.\n\nCate explained to me what every role in the pack entails. I was especially fascinated by the way the current alpha trains the burgeoning alpha, as if it were so at peace with death that it instinctively knew to train its replacement. That was the kind of surrender I needed to navigate the grief in my chest. It also comes in handy in a business where you constantly feel as if you were being replaced by people who are younger and prettier and got famous by posting bikini pictures on Instagram.\n\nMy ego doesn\u2019t love being wrong, so I snooped around for some information that would make me seem less incorrect about the alpha thing. I know quite a bit about dogs, and some of the rescued wolves at the sanctuary had been bred with dogs. I tried to figure out a way to manipulate the conversation to a topic I know something about. I asked, \u201cWhich ones have the highest dog content or the highest wolf content?\u201d I could tell that she was asked this question a lot. \u201cDo you give them blood tests to find out which are more wolf than dog?\u201d\n\nCate explained that they don\u2019t give the wolves blood tests. They focus on their behavior. Some wolves were not raised with other wolves, so they never learned certain behaviors, and some that looked less like them were raised with wolves and hence more wolflike. Hang out with a wolf, and you\u2019ll become more like one.\n\nI had just spent two years putting all my time and sweat into making \u201cThe Female Brain,\u201d a film that explores how much of our behavior is nature versus nurture, and after five minutes with wolves, it all made sense. The death of a parent tends to make you wonder if you were destined to follow in his footsteps or repeat his mistakes, but the wolves showed me that maybe the apple can fall far from the tree.\n\nIn a culture that makes me feel that I have to compete, audition, peacock, post and posture constantly, observing the effortless functionality of the wolf pack pushed \u201cPause\u201d on those impulses. The alpha wolf showed me that when I\u2019m feeling as if I need to work more, make more, fight more or tweet more, maybe the best thing I can do for myself and everyone around me is to go take a nap.", "title": "Whitney Cummings: The First Time I Hung Out With Wolves", "authors": ["Whitney Cummings"]}

The issue wasn\u2019t how Shelton looked so much as how he presented: as the Everyman, prized not in spite of his everyday appearance but because of it. (As Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Dana Schwartz tweeted, \u201cBlake Shelton is, at best, the sexiest divorced dad at this barbecue.\u201d) The consensus replacements were the actors Idris Elba and Mahershala Ali, each more conventionally attractive, each also black.

If not now, when more than 150 girls and families have been hurt by a sport that turned its back on them, then when?\n\nIf the Olympic committee needs encouragement to make the move, it should just listen to the piercing words of the women who spoke at Dr. Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearing last week. About 120 were expected to face Dr. Nassar or provide statements regarding their abuse.\n\n\u201cI was not protected,\u201d Jordyn Wieber, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist, said on Friday, as she said in public, for the first time, that Dr. Nassar abused her. \u201cMy teammates were not protected. My parents trusted U.S.A. Gymnastics and Larry Nassar to take care of me, and we were betrayed by both.\u201d\n\nIn tears, Ms. Wieber described how Dr. Nassar began grooming her with food and gifts when she was 8, and began molesting her when she was 14. How much more does the Olympic committee need to bulldoze U.S.A. Gymnastics, so the organization can be rebuilt without the people who couldn\u2019t see, or didn\u2019t want to see, a monster right before them?\n\nScott Blackmun, chief executive of the Olympic committee, wasn\u2019t available for comment for this column, but here\u2019s a primer for him:\n\nBecause of U.S.A. Gymnastics\u2019 decades-long practice of failing to report sexual-abuse accusations in the sport to law enforcement, Congress decided there needed to be a federal law to remedy it. In the wake of the Nassar case, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that would make it mandatory for the national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police. The bill passed the Senate in November and is expected to be passed in the House in the next few weeks.\n\nA majority of the gymnastics federation\u2019s officials and board members have remained in their posts throughout the Nassar scandal, even though many of the women molested by Dr. Nassar \u2014 including the Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman \u2014 have repeatedly called for the officials to step down or be removed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThree days after Simone Biles said she was abused by Dr. Nassar and added that she dreaded going back to the national training center in Texas because she was abused there, the gymnastics federation said it wouldn\u2019t return to that site. That change came because of the power of Ms. Biles and other women speaking up.\n\nNow, the Olympic committee should listen to the athletes, too.\n\n\u201cIf they really cared, then there would be a lot of change,\u201d Ms. Raisman told ESPN, referring to the gymnastics federation, last week. \u201cAnd there hasn\u2019t been enough change.\u201d\n\nMs. Raisman and other gymnasts have called for Paul Parilla, the federation\u2019s chairman, to step down, but Mr. Parilla \u2014 a lawyer and retired Marine Corps colonel \u2014 has only dug in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn a statement last March, Mr. Parilla \u2014 whose daughter, Jennifer, is a two-time Olympian in trampoline \u2014 said, \u201cThe entire leadership of U.S.A. Gymnastics shares the U.S.O.C.\u2019s commitment to promoting a safe environment for athletes, and we take its views very seriously.\u201d\n\nYet in an investigative review paid for by the federation, the former federal prosecutor Deborah J. Daniels described the weaknesses of U.S.A. Gymnastics. One of them was that the board didn\u2019t adequately address the sport\u2019s sexual-abuse problem.\n\nHer report criticized the board because it didn\u2019t hold management accountable for protecting children, failed to routinely question management about the issue and spent \u201cvery little time\u201d discussing child-abuse prevention.\n\nMs. Daniels also saw a problem with how long some members have been serving on the board because it could lead to insularity. There is a provision in the federation\u2019s bylaws for members to serve only two four-year terms, but Mr. Parilla has been there for 19 years.\n\n\u201cWhen a sexual-abuse case came up during my time on the board, the concern was about the reputation of the coach \u2014 not the accusation of the athlete,\u201d Jessica Howard, a national champion in rhythmic gymnastics who was abused by Dr. Nassar, wrote in a first-person piece for a New York Times blog. She, too, wants wholesale changes to the board that failed in its mission to oversee the federation.\n\nThe leaders of U.S.A. Gymnastics fought to keep the abuse secret.\n\nMcKayla Maroney, an Olympic gold medalist, said she signed a nondisclosure agreement in 2016 and, according to The Wall Street Journal, received $1.25 million from the federation in exchange for her promise to remain quiet about Dr. Nassar\u2019s abuse. The problem is, according to her lawyer, John Manly, that forcing a witness in a felony sexual-assault case to remain silent about her abuse might be illegal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Raisman has also said the federation prodded her to keep her abuse from the public.\n\nThe evidence is there that the gymnastics federation is in need of substantial change, though I acknowledge that decertification presents some complications.\n\nIf the federation is no longer recognized as the governing body of gymnastics, top gymnasts can lose their funding. Their status as athletes training at the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs might be revoked. They might not be able to compete internationally because the international federation of gymnastics only recognizes athletes from a nation that has an official governing body.\n\nStill, all of these issues can be worked out in the interest of the athletes \u2014 the people who should matter most.\n\nThe Olympic committee could also put the gymnastics federation on probation, which would be a way to warn it that it needs to change.\n\nThe Olympic committee needs to do something, anything, to signal to gymnasts that it cares about their safety \u2014 and not just about money and medals.\n\nWhich brings us back to Ms. Raisman.\n\n\u201cI have represented the U.S.A. at two Olympics and have done so successfully,\u201d she said on Friday in the Ingham County, Mich., courthouse, facing Dr. Nassar. \u201cAnd both U.S.A. Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success. But did they reach out when I came forward?\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nNot a good look for this country\u2019s Olympic officials. After everything we heard last week, why are they still propping up U.S.A.

According to interviews with Comoran officials, immigration lawyers and activists, the United Arab Emirates not only pays for the papers but also helps Comoran officials summon and document the bidoon. Officials from the Emirates\u2019 Interior Ministry have also been known to pressure applicants into becoming Comoran by refusing them driver\u2019s licenses and threatening not to let their children enroll in school.\n\nMany small countries, like Vanuatu and Malta, have recently put passports up for sale. This citizenship market paved the way for the Comoran scenario by turning passports into something that can be bought like any other commodity. But most of those countries market their citizenship to wealthy people seeking another passport to make international travel or banking easier. With Comoros, it\u2019s the Emirati state paying a poorer country for something it chooses not to provide itself.\n\nA Comoros passport does help stateless people travel and deal more easily with everyday bureaucracy. But it also sets a frightening precedent. It\u2019s easy to imagine a scenario in which large groups of displaced people, or minorities in a country that would sooner see them gone, are forced to take a foreign nationality under duress and are then sent away, absolving their home country of any legal responsibility.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the size of the program is a security liability. Due diligence on passport applicants is bare-bones, and some officials have been caught selling passports on the side, with thousands of documents sold through parallel networks, according to a new analysis by members of the Comoran Parliament. Other documents show recent Comoran passport recipients aren\u2019t just Emirati-born stateless people but also individuals born in Burma, Bangladesh, Iran and other countries, as well as a handful of Westerners. (It\u2019s unclear whether they signed on covertly as bidoon under the Emirati program or bought new papers for themselves through middlemen.)\n\nMore worrying still is uncertainty over whether the new Comorans even have a right to settle in \u201ctheir\u201d country, should they ever need to. When Comoran members of Parliament voted for the controversial economic citizenship law in 2008, they assumed no economic citizens would physically relocate to the islands. So far, none have. But their right of return becomes significant if or when those individuals seek refuge outside the Emirates.\n\nIn 2012, a man named Ahmed Abdelkhaleq was expelled from the United Arab Emirates for his activism defending the rights of stateless people. He held a Comoran passport but was ultimately granted asylum in Canada rather than being sent \u201chome\u201d to Comoros. In this isolated incident, \u201ceconomic\u201d citizenship did not stand in his way, but no jurisprudence exists to determine how Comoran \u201cexpatriates\u201d will be treated by foreign countries and courts. Nor is there any decisive international law on the matter.\n\nComorans are Muslim, and many wish to visit Mecca, but permits are set aside for would-be pilgrims according to their nationality. In a letter to his colleagues, the head of the Comoros Parliament complained that \u201ceconomic citizens\u201d routinely fill this quota, leaving \u201creal\u201d Comoran pilgrims in a spiritual lurch. And a few years ago I asked a visiting demographer about whether he would count the Emirati Comorans in coming population surveys.

{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "Springfield Arbors preschool consists of one long hallway on the ground floor of an assisted-living facility, with several classrooms strung along either side. The surrounding neighborhood, known as Six Corners, is home to a high school (the same one that Kelly attended), a community college and a steady beat of drug- and gang-related violence. Six Corners children live on the down side of what\u2019s known in education circles as the achievement gap. According to analysis done by the Massachusetts-based nonprofit Strategies for Children, between 12 and 14 percent of third graders in some Six Corners schools read at or above grade level, compared with between 37 and 43 percent in nearby Forest Park, a neighborhood known for its well-preserved Victorian homes, and as the birthplace of Dr. Seuss, the city\u2019s most famous native son.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly came to preschool teaching about a decade ago, when the local caterer she was working for abruptly shut down. For a single mother with a high-school diploma, the options in Springfield were limited: Home health aides, retail salespeople and food-service workers all made about the same salary. Receptionists and secretaries made more, but those jobs required office experience, and the work itself sounded dull. Kelly wanted a job helping people. She had only ever worked in food service, but when she found a local preschool with an opening in the kitchen, she saw a chance to pivot.\n\nShe started by making herself known in the classroom, lingering to help out when she delivered lunches, introducing herself to parents in the hallway, befriending the teachers and asking them about their work. When an assistant-teacher spot opened up, she jumped on it. She considered it a promotion, even though the teacher\u2019s salary ($9 an hour) was actually $1 an hour less than what she made as a school cook. For the first year, she split her time between the kitchen and the classroom while she earned her Child Development Associate certification, or C.D.A., which required her to complete a nine-month course that met for four hours every Saturday at the local Y.M.C.A.\n\nAt first she thought that credential would help her carve a path to some greater edification: a higher degree, maybe, and a higher wage along with it. But those dreams were quickly jettisoned. In 2011, just as she was completing her first class at the community college, an electrical fire tore through the three-family home that Kelly and her two children shared with her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousin. Her relatives\u2019 apartments weren\u2019t damaged much, but Kelly and her children lost nearly all their possessions. Worse, the fire seemed to usher in a newly dark chapter in her life. In 2012, her younger brother died in a horrific car accident; a year later, her cousin was shot and killed, and her aunt died. Her daughter\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 the father of her newborn grandson \u2014 was also killed, in another shooting. Somewhere in the middle of those heartaches, the preschool she worked at closed, and Kelly moved on to Springfield Arbors.\n\nThe C.D.A. taught her the basics of lesson planning, class structure and family engagement, but her real training came through trial and error. Kelly\u2019s classroom was often chaotic, but parents quickly learned that they could come to her with concerns, even after their children had aged out of her classroom. One mother asked her to step in as foster parent during a particularly tough time. Others hired her to babysit when they picked up night shifts at one job or another, so that Kelly might welcome a given child at 8 in the morning and not return him to his mother until well after 10 or 11 at night. The work was exhausting, but she found she had a knack for it \u2014 an instinct for what her students needed, an ability to relate to them and, when all else failed, a willingness to keep trying.\n\nOne early-spring afternoon, when a rainstorm kept the children indoors during what would normally be playtime, Kelly tried arranging a field trip to the basement hallway \u2014 the only substitute playground at Springfield Arbors. But when too many of them fell into tantrum mode at the same time, she changed tack and set up the portable chalkboard at the front of the room. It did not take long for one, then three, then a dozen of the children to notice her chalking letters and gather around. The letter of the week was \u201cD,\u201d and she had been teaching the students what words it was used in and showing them how to write and pronounce it. \u201cDown, over, over,\u201d she said in a long, slow drawl, as she drew first the spine and then the hump of the letter. She was speaking to one little boy specifically, and when she was done, she handed the chalk to him and held his hand as he repeated her movements. Then she removed her hand and nodded at him to try on his own.\n\nAt first, the class was enthralled by this demonstration. But then one little boy started screaming. Grandma, an elderly volunteer who sometimes came for an hour or two and mostly sat in back of the room on a small couch, grabbed the boy\u2019s arm and yanked him to her side. \u201cCut it out,\u201d she said. \u201cCome sit!\u201d The boy yanked his arm back, flopped onto the floor and wailed. Kelly kept her focus on the students at the blackboard. Eventually the screamer ran back over to the circle and forced another little boy off his seat, which made the other boy cry, which distracted the rest of the class and set half of them wandering off, before anyone had made a full D.\n\nWhen nap time came it seemed impossible that any one of the tiny, furious bodies twirling through the room could be stilled long enough to let sleep come, let alone all of them at once. But the sleeping mats were soon laid out across the room, and the children took their cue, except for the little blond boy, who wouldn\u2019t lie still. One of Kelly\u2019s colleagues sat on the floor near him, urging him to calm himself. \u201cRelax your body,\u201d she said over and over, patting his back. But it was no use, so she traded spots with Kelly. Kelly leaned over the little blond boy and made eye contact with him and allowed him to grab at her hands with his. This seemed to do the trick. When he settled in just enough to release his grip, she took her cellphone out and played soft music, just for him, which clinched the deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time all the children fell asleep, Kelly was sitting cross-legged on the floor with four little ones unfurled like flower petals around her. She was rubbing each of their backs in turn with one hand \u2014 rub, rub, pat, next; rub, rub, pat, next \u2014 while rocking a fifth in her other arm. Her classroom had a total of 19 students just then, and in order for her to grab lunch, the school\u2019s cook had to be summoned to sit with the sleeping children. She pulled a pack of noodles from her coat pocket and tiptoed toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s a ramen week,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just spent a fortune on household stuff yesterday, and my son has two basketball games this week.\u201d The high school charged $5 admission to each game, and Kelly rarely missed one, even when it meant skimping on meals.\n\nShe returned a few minutes later with a bowl of steaming noodles and two co-teachers. As the children snoozed, the three women slipped into a whispered chat. One student\u2019s voucher was about to expire, and the student\u2019s mother had yet to contact the voucher office to renew it. They debated who was to blame for this looming catastrophe; but how the voucher office worked was a mystery, even to these women who were both mothers and teachers.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call them,\u201d one teacher said. \u201cThey never answer. You have to go down there.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe must have missed her appointment,\u201d another added.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t always give appointments,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey never gave my daughter one for my grandson.\u201d\n\nOne teacher, Miss RJ, was summoned to the office: The nurse at her own children\u2019s school was calling to say that both of them were sick. But Springfield Arbors was still short-staffed. So Miss RJ was stuck there, and her own children were stuck with someone else.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The upper-and-middle-income track was designed specifically to engage and nourish young minds at their ripest juncture. The low-income track originated in the social-welfare system; its programs were created not just for children but also for their mothers, who needed to work. As such, they tend to be larger and staffed by teachers with high-school diplomas. They also tend to be chronically underfunded.\n\nThe last half-century is littered with attempts to merge these two tracks \u2014 that is, to make the day cares of the poor more like the preschools of the middle class and wealthy. But those efforts have long been plagued by a deep cultural ambivalence toward both charity and working mothers. When Head Start, the nation\u2019s first public preschool, began in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty, its goals were twofold: to provide underprivileged preschoolers the tools they needed to keep up with their better-off peers; and to offer an economic boost for their mothers, some of whom were recruited and trained to work at the centers as educators. The program was part of what would come to be known as the country\u2019s biggest peacetime mobilization of human resources, but enthusiasm for it was short-lived. Amid concerns about \u201cfamily weakening\u201d in the 1970s and \u201cwelfare queens\u201d in the 1980s, funding for early education stalled. Today Head Start serves less than one-third of the nation\u2019s eligible students. As part of a wave of reforms about a decade ago, Head Start began requiring half of its lead teachers to hold bachelor\u2019s degrees. It\u2019s too soon to tell what impact this has had on teaching and learning, but one unintended consequence is that it\u2019s harder for teachers like Kelly to find work at the centers.\n\nHead Start is not the only program to raise credentialing requirements for preschool teachers. In 1998, as a result of a lawsuit filed by the Education Law Center, an advocacy group for New Jersey public-school children, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered 31 low-income school districts to provide high-quality preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Among other things, the court\u2019s definition of \u201chigh quality\u201d included full-day programs staffed by college-educated teachers who earned salaries equal to those of their K-12 counterparts. The resulting program \u2014 known as the Abbott preschool program, after the lawsuit that led to the mandate \u2014 represents one of the first efforts among education reformers to replicate the models of Perry and Abecedarian and bring them to scale.\n\nOne recent morning in a brightly colored classroom at Egenolf, an Abbott preschool in Elizabeth, N.J. A 3-year-old girl with soft brown pigtails and a white shirt examined a row of water bottles, each of which had a pine cone submerged in a different liquid, and dictated observations to her teacher, Yamila Lopez Hevia. The cone in the \u201ccold water\u201d bottle was closing up. The one in warm water was closing, too \u2014 but more slowly. \u201cAnd what do we think is going on?\u201d Lopez asked. \u201cWhy might that happen?\u201d After a brief pause, the girl pulled up two big words, each of which she had heard from Lopez.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe pine cones, she explained, were a-dap-ting to their en-viron-ment.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was the crowning moment to a much larger project that began when the children noticed that it was getting colder out and that the leaves were changing color. Lopez led them through a dialogue about how trees and other plants get ready for winter. From there, they turned their attention to what animals do. Lopez took the class to a local park, where they noticed squirrels collecting nuts and looked for birds who might be getting ready to migrate. In the end, they circled back to themselves, discussing sweaters and warm coats and winter boots. \u201cWe introduced some big concepts,\u201d Lopez told me when I visited her class recently. \u201cAnd it all started with that one simple question: \u2018What do you see happening around you?\u2019 \u201d The technique was called scaffolding, and it was a key tenet of current preschool pedagogy, which Lopez learned as a student teacher.\n\nAccording to that pedagogy, preschoolers discover the world around them through trial, error and experimentation. They learn by doing things more than by thinking about them. The techniques that educators and developmental psychologists have devised for cultivating this natural tendency are decidedly Socratic. Rather than standing at a blackboard chalking letters or leading a large group in song, they assert, teachers like Kelly and Lopez should pay close attention to what the children themselves are interested in, or puzzled by, and respond to that. Any given moment is ripe with the opportunity to teach in this way, but doing it well requires a suite of disparate skills. A squirrel collecting nuts for the winter might hold a biology lesson; but to offer that lesson, a teacher needs to recognize the moment as it occurs. She also needs a grounding in that discipline and a clear sense of where the student in question sits on the developmental spectrum.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is really individualized intentional teaching,\u201d says Steven Barnett, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. \u201cAnd there\u2019s specialized knowledge that preschool teachers need that\u2019s different even from what kindergarten and first-grade teachers need.\u201d For example, he says, preschoolers are apt to reverse letters. \u201cIt really helps to understand why they do that, if you want to help them get it right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an isolated thing. Like, let\u2019s take my sippy cup. My whole life up to now, my sippy cup is a sippy cup no matter what way I hold it \u2014 upside down, sideways, whatever. But now you give me this thing called a d. And I put it down one way and it\u2019s a b. And another way and you tell me it\u2019s a p. What\u2019s with that?\u201d\n\nBarnett and others say that the ability to guide preschoolers through this stage of development takes a college degree. Teachers who don\u2019t have rich vocabularies or groundings in math and science can\u2019t impart those things to their students, he says. In a 2015 report, the Institute of Medicine agreed. The report argued that holding preschool teachers to lower standards than public-school teachers has fed the perception that the work itself is low-skill and in turn has helped justify policies that keep preschool teachers\u2019 wages down and prevent them from growing professionally.\n\nBut teachers themselves have been divided over the prospect of new job requirements. Many of them migrated to the field precisely because it did not require a higher degree. College \u2014 navigating financial aid, carving out the hours for class and homework \u2014 takes time and money and know-how. And for those who have been doing the job for years or even decades, the suggestion that they need additional training can feel like an insult.\n\nAbbott addressed these issues head-on. It provided intensive college-admissions counseling, including help with financial-aid forms and scheduling. It also covered tuition for teachers in the program and nudged the college programs to bring their classes to the preschools. \u201cWe had the college professors go into the Newark schools and hold their classes there so that the teachers didn\u2019t have to travel,\u201d Barnett says. \u201cWe also paid for substitutes when the teachers needed to go to classes during the day, because we knew that not everybody could do this at night school.\u201d The process was neither cheap nor easy nor fast, he adds. Many teachers struggled through remedial courses and community college before making their way into bachelor\u2019s degree programs. All told, it costs $14,000 per child per year, more than twice the national average.", "title": "Why Are Our Most Important Teachers Paid the Least?", "authors": ["Jeneen Interlandi"]}
{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "Thome played third in the 1995 World Series against Jones and the Atlanta Braves, but when the Indians returned two years later, he had settled in at first. The Indians had lost their left fielder, Albert Belle, as a free agent, and replaced his power with Matt Williams, a third baseman. Thome \u2014 who had been heckled during his rookie year as he struggled to learn third at a cavernous Municipal Stadium \u2014 was finally making progress when he switched.\n\n\u201cI had just started to get comfortable when I was asked to go to first,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, longevity-wise, could I have stayed there? Probably not, no. But knowing that I played third base at the big league level, I\u2019m proud of it, and to watch Chipper go in, to me it\u2019s special, because I know how tough that position is.\u201d\n\nHoffman did not pitch at all from his final day of Little League at Delco Field in Anaheim, Calif., until his first bullpen session in Charleston. He hit just .225 in the minors and called himself a \u201cterrible\u201d third baseman, but his brother, Glenn, had played the position in the majors. When Hoffman left the University of Arizona, he assumed he would, too.\n\n\u201cComing out of the U of A as an infielder, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m just going to work hard, just like Glenn did; this is the path I\u2019ve been given,\u2019\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cBut my pops had this vision with all of us to not pitch us after Little League. So we didn\u2019t have any of these extra bullets that we gave up through high school or through college. We had the fresh arm in case we had to fall back on it. Glenn never had to. I, quickly in my career, had to utilize it.\u201d\n\nThome and Hoffman are hardly the only prominent players to abandon third base. Harmon Killebrew and Tony Perez played more than 700 games at third, but more at first. Jeff Bagwell played there in the minors. Several prominent sluggers of the last few decades \u2014 from Mark McGwire, Gary Sheffield and Jason Giambi to Albert Pujols, Miguel Cabrera and Chris Davis \u2014 also spent time at third.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo, maybe third base is simply a spot where few players last very long. But if that\u2019s true, then why have 25 men played 2,000 games at third base, compared with 20 who have done so at first base, 12 at second base and 19 at shortstop and five at catcher? Schmidt theorized that, before the sublime defender Brooks Robinson, third base was mainly a place for decent hitters who could simply knock down a hard grounder.\n\n\u201cYou put a really good player over there \u2014 a 20-home run, 75-R.B.I. guy \u2014 but most of those were never really 35 and 110 guys,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThey were just really good players. Ron Santo\u2019s a perfect example of a guy who eventually got into the Hall of Fame, but he was on the borderline for so many years. You look around at all the other positions, it seems they have a lot of players who were really the greatest of the great.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSchmidt cited several excellent third basemen who have fallen just short of Cooperstown: Ken Boyer, Graig Nettles, Bill Madlock, Buddy Bell and Ron Cey. And, as Jones did on Thursday, he pointed to a current player, Adrian Beltre, as an obvious Hall of Famer.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A first baseman stays more engaged in the action than a third baseman, Schmidt said, without the physical demands of the middle infield.\n\n\u201cYou get to talk to the other team\u2019s hitters when they come down there, you\u2019re holding runners on, jumping off the base,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was third base with an added amount of fun, because there was a lot more responsibility with the baseball. So that was easy. I loved that position.\u201d\n\nAlas, his stay at first base was brief; Schmidt switched back in 1986 and won his third National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was 36 then and credited Pat Croce \u2014 a physical therapist who later became president of the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 with helping him stay agile deep into his 30s, despite knee trouble.\n\nJones had his own knee problems near the end of his career, but still ranks seventh in career games at third base. Asked how he did it, Jones laughed and said, \u201cBlessed.\u201d The current crop of star third basemen \u2014 Nolan Arenado, Kris Bryant, Josh Donaldson, Evan Longoria, Manny Machado, Anthony Rendon \u2014 could only hope to be so lucky.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cthe greatest players in the game today are third basemen.\u201d\n\nHe might be right, and in their old age, Schmidt, Jones and the others could have plenty of company at third base in the Cooperstown team picture. But for now it\u2019s the smallest group, and the reason remains a mystery.\n\nFor the best answer, perhaps, we should turn to Abbott and Costello. In their famous \u201cWho\u2019s On First?\u201d routine, they had a fitting name for the third baseman:\n\nI Don\u2019t Know.", "title": "Why Are There So Few Third Basemen in the Hall of Fame?", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner", "On Baseball"]}

The genre has garnered more critical respect today, but the tradition of dismissing it remains alive. Just last year, another film critic from The Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan, wrote off the entire genre in an essay that suggested he sees scary movies narrowly, a genre for escapist shocks. A similar condescension can be found from those who have told me that \u201cGet Out\u201d is a comedy because it has funny moments. \u201cHamlet\u201d has laughs, but no one calls it a comedy.\n\nNo wonder Mr. Peele prefers \u201csocial thriller.\u201d But by using this relatively obscure term, he implies the more common designation, horror, is unconcerned with politics or social issues, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nPhoto\n\nYou need only look at the career of George Romero, who imbued his zombie movies with blunt social commentary on consumerism, race and Cold War militarism. When Mr. Romero (\u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d) and Tobe Hooper (\u201cThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\u201d) died last year, horror lost two of its most important artists. They left behind movies that serve as a persuasive counterargument to the idea that horror cannot be righteous, funny or beautiful. They inspired generations of filmmakers, creating tropes of fear that have been adopted and refined, building a foundation for modern horror sturdy enough to support an incredibly diverse array of work, ranging from the queasy thrills of \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe\u201d to the austere shocker \u201cIt Follows\u201d to the psychological blood bath \u201cMother!\u201d\n\nIn his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott described \u201cMother!\u201d as a comedy, but considering its outlandish gore, its debt to \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and the director Darren Aronofsky\u2019s history with skewed-world terror, I see it as closer to horror.\n\nHorror movies are nearly as old as film itself (the first \u201cFrankenstein\u201d movie was produced by Thomas Edison in 1910), and to be fair, over the last century, the definition of the horror movie has shifted and is still evolving. How do you define horror? It depends on what era you are referring to. Before the late 1960s, when someone referred to horror, they usually meant the supernatural. Carlos Clarens\u2019s pioneering 1967 book, \u201cAn Illustrated History of the Horror Film,\u201d made only brief mention of \u201cPsycho\u201d and \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d because they focused on humans, which, Mr. Clarens argued, put them outside the realm of what he considered \u201cpure horror.\u201d\n\nIn its current, mature incarnation, horror is applied to so many different kinds of movies that it\u2019s harder than ever to pin it down. But the traditions of the classic Universal monster movies and the new horror of the 1970s remain influential on screens today. Horror deserves to be considered as a broad genre, not a niche that exists outside rooms where the most prestigious awards are given out. Guillermo del Toro, the greatest monster movie director alive, seemed to be making a similar case in \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d a film widely described as a romance, with the lovers being a mysterious scaly beast and a woman played with terrific sensitivity by Sally Hawkins.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShape\u201d is overtly inspired by \u201cCreature From the Black Lagoon,\u201d the 1954 B-movie about a murderous aquatic humanoid, but it also harks back to classic horror from the 1920s and \u201930s, when fans saw those monsters as new kinds of heroes, misunderstood outcasts from a cruel society. The monster in \u201cFrankenstein\u201d may have had violent tendencies, but that wasn\u2019t his fault \u2014 and he had a gentle side that contrasted with the mob out to get him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy allowing the creature to not only get the girl but to also be plausibly loved by her, Mr. del Toro has extended his longstanding sympathy for monsters further than anyone else, while keeping elements of dread and violence in the mix. He didn\u2019t leave horror to make a romance so much as show us that romance was always inherent in horror.\n\nWhen he won best director at the Golden Globes, he started his acceptance speech by praising monsters as \u201cpatron saints of our blissful imperfections.\u201d He fully embraced the horror genre, ending on a pointed historical note referring to one of the earliest and greatest scary movie stars, famous for his performances as monsters like Quasimodo that inspired repulsion but also empathy. \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Mr. del Toro said with a chuckle, \u201cLon Chaney is smiling upon all of us.\u201d\n\nThen he walked offstage and made his point more explicit in the pressroom, saying it\u2019s important that \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d stood next to movies from more traditionally respected genres. \u201cWe have a place in the cinematic conversation that has led to the creation of beautiful powerful images but also, thematic weight,\u201d he said, as momentum surely built for his movie\u2019s Oscar campaign.\n\nThe conviction in his voice made me think that maybe it is horror\u2019s time after all.", "title": "Why Are We Ashamed to Call \u2018Get Out\u2019 and \u2018The Shape of Water\u2019 Horror Films?", "authors": ["Jason Zinoman"]}

As a result, Premier Li Keqiang acknowledged last year, China\u2019s air-pollution measures have focused on limiting coal burning, car emissions and flying dust. They do not tackle other pollutants, like ammonia released by nitrogen fertilizers used in agriculture, which, some scientists have said, may contribute up to 20 percent of the smog in China.\n\nThe targets were also determined without the benefit of adequate research about the effects of pollution on human health. As of a few months ago, senior health officials were still claiming not to have conclusive clinical studies about the connection between smog and cancer. (Cancer is a leading cause of death in China, and lung cancer is its most common form.) Plausible or not, that assertion suggests that measures for controlling air pollution were devised with too little regard for its actual impact on health.

The toll was nearly 25 percent higher than the 6,967 maimed and dead counted a year earlier, and more than double the 3,993 in 2014.

Cluster munitions alone caused 971 known casualties in 2016, more than twice the toll of the previous year, according to Cluster Munition Monitor. Most victims were Syrians, nearly all of them civilians, but Saudi Arabia has also used American-supplied cluster bombs in Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPerhaps the saddest part of all this is that for well over a decade the world seemed to have gotten a grip on what are referred to generically as the \u201cexplosive remnants of war.\u201d Thanks to an international treaty that came into force in 1999 \u2014 now signed by 163 countries and banning the production, stockpiling and transfer of land mines \u2014 casualties declined steadily worldwide.

This additional effect outweighs the harm caused by secondhand smoke by enough to suggest that our efforts to discourage smoking, strict as they seem, may not be nearly strict enough.\n\nSome are more sensitive than others to environmental influences. I have four adult sons, none of whom is a smoker. I once remarked to a friend that if they had grown up when I did, at least two of them would be. My son Chris, who was present during this conversation, immediately asked, \u201cWhich two?\u201d \u201cDavid (my oldest) almost certainly would have been,\u201d I said, \u201cand Hayden (my youngest) probably would have been, too.\u201d I added that Jason wouldn\u2019t have smoked no matter when he had been born. Chris seemed offended, insisting that he, too, probably would have become a smoker if he had grown up when I did.\n\nWhen I started smoking at age 14 in 1959, many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn\u2019t want me to smoke, but as smokers themselves, they were poorly positioned to object. In those days, more than 60 percent of American men were smokers, and almost as many women. Smoking was just something that most people did.\n\nYet even then, people who smoked did not seem happy about it. Today, roughly 90 percent of smokers say they regret having started, and about 80 percent express a desire to quit. Some 40 to 50 percent of smokers try to quit each year, but fewer than 5 percent of them succeed. Several of my own attempts to quit failed. So I count myself fortunate to have abandoned the habit before leaving home for college.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By far the most powerful predictor of whether a person will smoke is the percentage of her closest friends who smoke. If the share of smokers in someone\u2019s peer group rises to 30 percent from 20 percent, for example, the probability that she will smoke rises by about 25 percent. Whereas most of my teenage friends were smokers, relatively few of my sons\u2019 friends were. In 2016, only about 19 percent of American men were smokers, and only about 14 percent of women.\n\nToday\u2019s environment is different mostly because of the taxes and other regulatory measures we have taken to discourage smoking. Well and good, but does anyone think that still having more than one smoker in six people is a desirable population ratio?\n\nOur stated rationale for discouraging smoking \u2014 to prevent harm caused by secondhand smoke \u2014 greatly understates the amount of harm that these actions prevent. When a regulation results in one smoker fewer, every friend of that person will have one smoker fewer in her peer group. Every member of every one of those peer groups will then become less likely to smoke. And that, in turn, will make others less likely to smoke, and so on.\n\nMost people don\u2019t like being regulated, but even strict libertarians concede the legitimacy of regulations to prevent undue harm to others. As John Stuart Mill memorably wrote in \u201cOn Liberty\u201d: \u201cThe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCausing someone to be more likely to smoke clearly inflicts substantial harm on that person. I have never heard even the staunchest libertarian say, \u201cI hope my children grow up to be smokers.\u201d Further discouraging smoking now will make it much easier to raise children to be nonsmokers.\n\nEvidence suggests that stricter measures to discourage smoking would make even smokers themselves happier. In a 2005 study, for example, the economists Jonathan Gruber and Sendhil Mullainathan found that people with a higher propensity to smoke were significantly happier in places with higher cigarette taxes. Higher taxes, they noted, made it easier for smokers to quit.\n\nToday\u2019s regulations to discourage smoking are strict, yes.

In large swathes of rural India, such as in Rajasthan, all of this is a steep ask. Yet if any one of these steps fail, applicants are denied food assistance.\n\nPreviously, an infirm, older person could send a relative or neighbor with the relevant paperwork as a proxy to collect monthly rations. Now, the biometric identification system requires one\u2019s physical presence.\n\nIn 2017, several economists and I conducted a survey of 900 households in Jharkhand, comparing villages that did and did not implement the Aadhaar system for buying grain. We discovered that the percentage of households that failed to obtain any grain at all was five times higher in the villages where Aadhaar authentication was compulsory (20 percent) than in those where it was not (4 percent).\n\nIn theory, biometric identification could help reduce identity fraud, but there has never been much evidence of large-scale identity fraud in India\u2019s welfare programs.\n\nThe main problem with, say, the main food aid program is that officials and intermediaries appear to misreport official disbursements and skim off some of the aid.

Those voices were barely heard. They came from the bottom of society and were either stifled halfway through by the government or drowned out by civil rights activists with better access to the international media. They have now forced their way to the surface and emerged as a resonant, nationwide cry for justice and equality.\n\nSince the 1979 revolution, Iranian politics has been defined by a split between reformists and principlists, conservatives who say they are devoted to the principles of the revolution. During the 1999 and 2009 uprisings, the protesters enjoyed support from powerful reformists. This time, the dichotomy has been transcended. The demonstrators don\u2019t want support from anyone associated with the status quo, including Mr. Rouhani, the reformist president. No wonder prominent reformist figures, even Ebrahim Nabavi, a dissident journalist living in exile, disparaged the protesters as \u201cthe potato-eating mob.\u201d\n\nIranian economists and intellectuals have long warned that something like this could happen. Even the figures relatively close to the government set off the alarm. In early 2015, Mohsen Renani, professor of economy at the University of Isfahan, wrote an open letter to the Guardian Council, Iran\u2019s highest clerical body and one of the country\u2019s most powerful institutions, expressing deep concern over rising inflation and government incompetence. Mr. Renani predicted that if issues like growing unemployment were not addressed within two years, Iran would face turmoil. Parviz Sedaghat, another prominent political economist, published an article just before the protests broke out discussing how Iran\u2019s economic system has produced first-class and second-class citizens, and warning that some government institutions have become economic conglomerates more powerful than the state. A detailed study published last month by the BBC\u2019s Farsi-language service demonstrated the alarming decline of household income over the past decade. Mr. Rouhani\u2019s austerity budget, submitted to Parliament on Dec. 10, only poured fuel on the rising fire.\n\nUnlike during the first decades of the post-revolutionary Iran, the rich now heedlessly flaunt their wealth. Until the mid-2000s, the gentlemen\u2019s agreement among the embezzlers held that they keep a modest appearance at home and launder their money in Dubai and Toronto. In the most famous case, Mahmoud Reza Khavari, the former managing director of Bank Melli, made off with hundreds of millions of dollars and became a real estate mogul in Toronto. That generation cared about appearances and never dropped the veneer of fealty to the ideals of the 1979 revolution. Their millennial offspring, on the other hand, hardly care. Wealthy young Iranians act like a new aristocratic class unaware of the sources of their wealth. They brazenly drive Porsches and Maseratis through the streets of Tehran before the eyes of the poor and post about their wealth on Instagram. The photos travel across apps and social media and enrage the hardworking people in other cities. Iranians see pictures of the family members of the authorities drinking and hanging out on beaches around the world, while their daughters are arrested over a fallen head scarf and their sons are jailed for buying alcohol. The double standard has cultivated an enormous public humiliation.\n\nThe people today at the top of power pyramid in Iran were involved in the 1979 revolution and witnessed firsthand how, when the shah decided he had \u201cheard the voice of the revolution,\u201d he marked the beginning of his end. That impression has been reinforced by the Arab Spring: Zine el-Abedine Bin Ali of Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt tried to appease protesters and were forced from power. Bashar al-Assad of Syria never even recognized the existence of opposition and he remains in office.\n\nIran has lived through multiple convulsions. The government has mastered the art of survival through crises. They may well survive this round as well but something has fundamentally changed: The unquestioning support of the rural people they relied on against the discontent of the metropolitan elite is no more.

In a working paper released in 2016, Mr. Barkai found that over the past 30 years, workers\u2019 cut of companies\u2019 revenue had fallen most in industries where concentration had increased the most, though he said in an interview that he was not yet convinced this was the cause of weak wage growth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFew workers epitomize the trend as much as agricultural-equipment mechanics, who faced the most concentrated group of prospective employers out of the roughly two dozen occupations that Mr. Azar, Ms. Marinescu and Mr. Steinbaum examined on CareerBuilder. On average, a single employer accounted for an overwhelming majority of job listings for farm-equipment mechanics in a so-called commuting zone in any given quarter.\n\nSuch findings probably wouldn\u2019t surprise Robert Gray, who worked at a farm-equipment dealership for more than two decades before becoming a teacher in the agricultural-equipment technology program at Madison Area Technical College, which has a partnership with John Deere.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Mr. Gray said, several equipment manufacturers had a sizable presence in Wisconsin. But after a series of mergers and acquisitions, a huge portion of the new farm equipment for sale in the state today is made by Deere or two rivals.\n\nAlong with the drop in manufacturers came a decline in the number of separately owned dealerships, which employ mechanics like Mr. Gies.\n\nBrett Faivre, whose family sold two John Deere dealerships to Riesterer & Schnell five years ago, said Deere had structured its contracts with dealers to encourage consolidation.\n\n\u201cVolume discounts are geared more toward larger dealerships,\u201d he said. \u201cThe larger the dealership, the more of a discount you get on equipment.\u201d\n\nKen Golden, a John Deere spokesman, said, \u201cDealership consolidation has occurred as machinery has become more complex and customers have grown their businesses.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical farm-equipment mechanic made about $18 an hour nationally in 2016. By contrast, the median wage for a mechanic who repairs construction and forestry equipment \u2014 similar machines painted different colors, according to Mr. Gray \u2014 is just under $24 per hour. The data collected by Mr. Azar, Ms. Marinescu and Mr. Steinbaum shows that there is substantially less concentration among employers listing openings for construction-equipment mechanics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPete Hoffman, a longtime farm equipment mechanic who teaches at Southwest Wisconsin Technical College, said there was another important factor in the disparity: Many mechanics in states like Wisconsin grow up on family farms and are keen to maintain their connection to agriculture. This could keep the supply of workers up and help hold wages down.\n\n\u201cThey like to smell that good black earth, the fresh-cut hay,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.

A second dealership chain, Mid-State Equipment, has a location in Columbus, about an hour away, but Mr. Gies said he was told it wasn\u2019t hiring when he inquired. (A Mid-State human resources official said the company was always looking for good technicians.)\n\nOther manufacturers have dealerships in the area that are also part of chains.\n\nDavid R. Henderson, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution, said the existence of additional options outside a worker\u2019s current occupation or city made him skeptical that concentration was having an effect on wages.

Less-skilled workers can change occupations relatively easily.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re unskilled, they fit in many kinds of jobs, and so you have more employers at the local level,\u201d Mr. Henderson said.\n\nSome manufacturing industries, like breakfast cereal and tobacco, are even more concentrated than farm equipment. But since many workers in those businesses are less skilled than farm-equipment mechanics, they may be more interchangeable with workers in other industries.\n\nTo the extent that less-urban areas have a problem, Mr. Henderson added, policymakers should make it easier for people to move to cities where there are more opportunities, perhaps by easing building restrictions that drive up housing prices. That suggestion was also raised in a report on employers\u2019 market power by President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nBut at least for workers who want to make a living in a certain kind of work without moving, consolidation may be an issue.\n\nMr. Gies spends his days at the cable company, and his nights doing freelance repair work on his family\u2019s farm.\n\nThe freelance work is fulfilling, and the pay is good \u2014 Mr. Gies charges $65 per hour for labor and expected to make $3,000 to $4,000 replacing the engine of an enormous green tractor parked in his shop on a recent night.\n\nBut when asked why he didn\u2019t go into business for himself full time, Mr. Gies demurred, alluding to the clubby nature of his field.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of guys that would come to me, but they don\u2019t want to shy away from that relationship they have with the dealers around here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dealers I know of, they kind of hold grudges if you get on their bad side.\u201d", "title": "Why Is Pay Lagging?

Trades using the Korean won account for around 5 percent of the volume of Bitcoin trades globally.\n\nWill the government pursue a ban?\n\nFor now, the authorities do not appear to be of one mind on the subject. After Mr. Park\u2019s comments on Thursday, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in clarified that the Justice Ministry\u2019s plan was not final, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nThen, on Friday, Kim Dong-yeon, the finance minister, emphasized that other ministries would be expected to confer on the Justice Ministry\u2019s proposal, Yonhap reported.\n\nWill lawmakers support it?\n\nAt the very least, a ban would not be passed quickly: Securing a majority of votes in the National Assembly could take months.\n\nMore to the point, several lawmakers from major parties signaled this week that they would not support a crackdown. Park Young-sun, a member of the governing party who has no relation to the justice minister, wrote on her Facebook page that closing the exchanges would be like \u201csetting fire to a straw-roofed house to catch a bedbug.\u201d Ha Tae-kyung, a legislator with the opposition Bareun Party, wrote on Facebook that criminalizing virtual currencies would fly in the face of the administration\u2019s claims to support new technologies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The most popular of these has garnered more than 120,000 signatures.\n\n\u201cThe power of the individual investor is very huge in South Korea,\u201d said Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Hashed, a fund in Seoul that invests in virtual currency projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat prompted the investigations?\n\nThe National Tax Service in South Korea declined to comment on why its representatives visited two major virtual currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, this week. But Shin Won-hee, head of operations at Coinone, said the tax authorities had wanted to check that the company had paid proper corporate tax.\n\nBithumb told local news outlets that it was cooperating with the investigation.\n\nSeparately, the police in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, have been investigating whether Coinone is operating \u201ca gambling site.\u201d The company had previously allowed investors to buy and sell virtual currencies on margin \u2014 that is, to place bets using borrowed money. But Mr. Shin said that Coinone decided in November to stop allowing margin trading as government officials began expressing concerns about market overheating.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin more expensive in South Korea?\n\nMr. Park, the justice minister, said this week that the depths of South Korean investors\u2019 irrationality was reflected in the high premium \u2014 around 30 percent on Friday \u2014 that they paid on Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea over those elsewhere.\n\nExperts said that South Korean prices were also higher because the exchanges there did not allow trading by foreigners. That prevents overseas investors from selling Bitcoin in South Korea to profit from \u2014 and thereby help narrow \u2014 the price gap.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s isolation from the global market leads investors at home to seek better prices elsewhere. \u201cWe are seeing Koreans taking loads of cash to buy Bitcoin in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia where Bitcoin is cheaper,\u201d said Hong Ki-hoon, professor of economics at Hongik University in Seoul.\n\nWhat do investors think?\n\nWith so many conflicting signals from the government, \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us think that these strong measures will actually be implemented,\u201d said Hyon Hae-in, a 35-year-old Bitcoin investor.\n\n\u201cLongtime investors see times like these as opportunities to trade,\u201d she said.", "title": "Why Is South Korea Spooking the Global Bitcoin Market?", "authors": ["Su-Hyun Lee", "Raymond Zhong"]}

And there isn\u2019t much data on how to qualify for these discounts. The schools may not explain the qualifications, or they\u2019ll hide the formula inside complex calculators. Moreover, the raw numbers of students who do get discounts are often listed in reports that are hard to find.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating bordering on maddening. Shouldn\u2019t we have as much data about merit aid and discounts as we do when buying a home or a car?\n\nTo try to decode some of this, I paid a visit to enrollment practitioners from Mount Holyoke, Simmons, Smith and Wellesley Colleges. The schools have a few important things in common besides Bay State geography: They\u2019re relatively small, and their undergraduate divisions are women\u2019s colleges.\n\nWhen it comes to how they give away and talk about merit aid, however, they are very different.\n\nBut first, a bit of history. For years, most financial aid was based on need. You disclosed your income and assets, and colleges would make their best offer with a package consisting of grants, loans and perhaps a campus job.\n\nThat system still exists, but starting in the 1980s another one emerged alongside it. It came to be known as merit aid because many of the early discounters started giving out grants to top students. Their hope was that drawing enough of those applicants might improve their colleges\u2019 rankings.", "title": "Why It\u2019s So Hard to Calculate What You\u2019ll Pay for College", "authors": []}

Much of the country endured a bitterly cold stretch, causing more people to be crowded together inside. The strain that has been most pervasive, H3N2, is nastier than most. And, we\u2019re being told, the vaccine this year is particularly ineffective.\n\nThat last fact has had many people wondering if they should still get a flu shot. If you read no further in this column, know this: The answer is yes, you should still get a flu shot. The flu season typically peaks December through February but can last until May, and it usually takes about two weeks for the shot\u2019s immunity to kick in.\n\nIt\u2019s worth exploring what we mean by effectiveness when we\u2019re discussing the flu vaccine.\n\nThe flu virus is unstable, and it changes a lot each season. This means that the immunity you gained from a shot a year ago doesn\u2019t work so well this time around. Each summer, scientists gather and try to make a best guess on which variants are going to be more common in the coming year. They look at data from countries like Australia (whose flu season comes before ours), then they make the shot to match.\n\nThis season, the flu vaccine is most protective against an H1NI, an H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage strain. Some vaccines also protect against a B/Yamagata lineage strain.", "title": "Why It\u2019s Still Worth Getting a Flu Shot", "authors": []}

Times of suppression.\u201d\n\nHer unsettling spot is replete with footage of white supremacists executing Nazi salutes, police in riot gear carrying off protesters \u2014 all the atrocities of the Trump era in which we are now mired. These alternate with shots of a leather-clad Ms. Manning walking determinedly in the nation\u2019s capital, a red rose in her hand. She is poised, but she is angry and ready for a fight (starting with the Democratic Party, of which Senator Cardin is one of its most powerful figures).\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to look at that video without thinking of the civil rights and antiwar movements 50 years ago. So many of its images remind me of ones I\u2019ve seen before \u2014 police attacking black people with fire hoses, marches on Washington, a young person gently putting a flower in the muzzle of a soldier\u2019s gun.\n\nThen, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to confront our enemies was to fight them or forgive them. Then, as now, it was unclear whether the best way to bring about social change was through violence or love.

Among the women raising the question of impropriety that night was the actress Ally Sheedy, who posted and then deleted a few cryptic tweets that said, among other things, \u201cWhy was James Franco allowed in?\u201d\n\nThese days every man in Hollywood seems to have a potential target slapped on his back, but the accusations followed a public incident in New York in 2014. That\u2019s when Mr. Franco, then 35, tried to arrange a hookup with a 17-year-old tourist via Instagram, and later admitted to having used bad judgment.\n\nOnto the present mess. Mr. Franco addressed the Golden Globes tweets last week on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d saying, \u201cI have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy.\u201d He also said: \u201cIf I\u2019ve done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.\u201d He also insisted that he fully supported women speaking out, and later told Seth Meyers in an appearance on his show that the tweets were inaccurate, but that \u201cthis is a conversation that needs to be had.\u201d\n\nThen on Jan. 11, The Los Angeles Times published its article, in which several women said Mr. Franco got peeved when they refused to remove their shirts during filming. Another woman, whom Mr. Franco had been seeing romantically, said that once, while they were sitting in a car, he had nudged her head down to encourage her to perform oral sex, and that \u201cthe power dynamic was really off.\u201d Mr. Franco\u2019s lawyer told The Los Angeles Times that the claims \u201cwere not accurate.\u201d (The actor\u2019s representatives directed The New York Times to statements on the late-night shows.) But since the Los Angeles Times article came out, the actor has laid low, skipping the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, where he was named best actor in a comedy. His representatives did not immediately confirm reports that he will attend the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday night.\n\nStill, those in the Oscar tea leaf reading game have concluded that chances are pretty good that Mr. Franco\u2019s name will be on the list when Oscar nominees are revealed next week.\n\nThe window for nomination voting opened Jan. 5 and closed Jan. 12, just one day after the article ran. The acting nominations are decided by the actors\u2019 branch \u2014 at 1,218 members, the largest one in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \u2014 and many had already submitted their ballots by the time the article appeared.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nInterviewing some of those voters, Glenn Whipp of The Los Angeles Times found that several regretted casting ballots for Mr. Franco yet, per academy rules, couldn\u2019t take them back. But the Bagger is also hearing that some in the actors\u2019 branch met the accusations against Mr. Franco with little more than a shrug, and felt they were small potatoes, especially compared with the alleged misdeeds of, say, Harvey Weinstein, to name just one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Franco\u2019s widely praised performance as real-life oddity Tommy Wiseau, the man behind the cult hit \u201cThe Room,\u201d had also already earned a best actor nomination from SAG-Aftra, the union behind the Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nThe awards projection site Gold Derby still has Mr. Franco squeaking in, in fifth place, among the likely best-actor Oscar nominees. With Gary Oldman (\u201cDarkest Hour\u201d) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d) dominating the race, Mr. Franco was always a long shot to win. The latest allegations make his odds even longer, the academy being particularly sensitive to how it is perceived.\n\nBut still. Mr. Franco could easily be in the running, which would hand the Oscars host, Jimmy Kimmel, a ready-made joke if there ever was one, whether Mr. Franco shows or not.\n\nBut the ceremony isn\u2019t until March 4, with each day bringing a shift in the #MeToo terrain, and each new allegation being met with a torrent of conflicting reactions. Consider all that has happened just in the week and a half since the Golden Globes:\n\n\u2022 Mark Wahlberg and his agency donated $2 million to Time\u2019s Up after the news broke that he\u2019d been paid $1.5 million to reshoot \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d scenes, while his co-star Michelle Williams earned less than $1,000.\n\n\u2022 Ashley Judd, one of the early Weinstein accusers and a deeply involved supporter of Time\u2019s Up, told the BBC that Mr. Franco\u2019s response was \u201cterrific.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019ve all behaved \u2014 at a certain level \u2014 unconsciously, and done things that were insensitive, inappropriate, without necessarily understanding that they were.\u201d Mr. Franco now counts among the very few accused men to publicly garner support.\n\n\u2022 Catherine Deneuve and more than 100 Frenchwomen signed an open letter denouncing #MeToo for conflating sexual assault with harmless flirtation. Amid the ensuing uproar, Ms. Deneuve apologized to victims she\u2019d offended.\n\n\u2022 Rebecca Hall and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet donated their salaries from the forthcoming Woody Allen film \u201cA Rainy Day in New York\u201d to anti-abuse causes. In December, Mr. Allen\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, who has accused him of molesting her, wrote a letter asking why #MeToo had spared him.\n\n\u2022 And then there are the controversial accusations, followed by a backlash, and a backlash to the backlash, against Aziz Ansari, made by an anonymous woman. (He has said he \u201ctook her words to heart and responded privately.\u201d)\n\nAll of which is to say, who the heck knows what the climate will be like when Oscars day dawns on March 4. Just think, the awards season last year felt like a guilty diversion from the craziness unfolding on the national stage.

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "Maybe so, but it still was a smart thing to do.\n\nMr. Mahathir\u2019s advanced age is an asset: His term would presumably be short, forcing turnover in a country long dominated by dynastic politics. Mr. Anwar, who is in prison on a sodomy conviction, is expected to be released in June, subject to a ban that prevents him from holding office for five years. But the prohibition can be lifted with a royal pardon, and Mr. Mahathir has committed to helping Mr. Anwar\u2019s rehabilitation and passing him the baton.\n\nMr. Mahathir is not just the only Malaysian politician today who can hold the fractious opposition together; he is also the only one who stands any chance of defeating Mr. Najib at his own game, namely by appealing to the Muslim-Malay majority.\n\nThe opposition has long been a motley assortment, usually of the Malay party led by Mr. Anwar, a predominantly ethnic-Chinese party and some Islamists. Partly because of their association with, say, the Chinese party, even Muslim-Malay opposition leaders like Mr. Anwar have been accused of betraying their own ethnic group and religion. And UMNO has consistently framed any challenge to it as a threat to Muslim-Malays\u2019 political power, their preferential quotas and even Islam itself.\n\nSuch charges can\u2019t stick against Mr. Mahathir.\n\nUMNO loyalists call him a turncoat, and reformists may question his bona fides as a democrat, but he is popular among many Malays. He is credited with spearheading the country\u2019s industrialization in the 1980s and standing up to the International Monetary Fund during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.\n\nHis Malay-nationalist credentials are even stronger than those of Mr. Najib, who contemplated rolling back ethnic privileges when he became prime minister in 2009. Mr. Mahathir vehemently opposed the move at the time. Today, his new party admits only Malays and natives of Borneo as its members \u2014 a clear attempt to steal some of UMNO\u2019s ethnic thunder.\n\nMr. Mahathir does seem to have an electoral weakness: his apparently tepid commitment to Islam. This has left him open to vicious attacks, notably from the Islamist party PAS, which was once in the opposition but has now joined forces with UMNO, and may play spoiler in this election.\n\nUMNO and PAS have a long and complicated relationship. In recent years Mr. Najib managed to lure a group of PAS hard-liners to his side by endorsing their call to implement and expand certain Shariah punishments. PAS, for its part, has defended Mr. Najib against charges of embezzlement, for example decrying the United States investigation into the 1MDB scandal as a foreign intervention. It has also announced that it will run in 130 out of 222 constituencies nationwide in the upcoming election, putting additional pressure on Pakatan Harapan.\n\nAlthough the opposition appears to be gaining traction, the odds do seem against its winning the contest, especially since the government continues to redraw voting districts to its advantage. A recent poll suggests that Mr. Najib\u2019s party may even secure two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, the voting majority required to amend the Constitution.", "title": "Opinion | Why Malaysia\u2019s Opposition Picked an Old Foe as Its New Leader", "authors": []}

There is absurdity in the task but also, maybe, joy, Camus wrote: \u201cThe absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be unceasing,\u201d Camus wrote, noting, \u201cThe rock is still rolling.\u201d (Camus would doubtlessly have said the same of the Tide.)\n\nSisyphus has a task.

Whereas there used to be no limit on the amount of interest that could be deducted, from now on, a company can only deduct interest expense equal to 30 percent of its Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. (In 2022, the limit on tax deductibility of interest tightens further to 30 percent of Ebit, after depreciation and amortization are deducted.)

(It\u2019s worth noting that the real estate industry somehow got itself exempted from these changes.)\n\nAll things being equal, the change in interest deductibility could affect how much buyout practitioners are willing to pay for companies. The cost of capital will now be higher, which in turn will affect the value of the company or business for sale.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the corporate tax rate lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent, the present value of the tax savings provided by the interest deduction will be less, too.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

By some measures, the prices paid by private equity firms to sellers were at a record high in 2017 as was the level of debt used to finance those deals, according to LeveragedLoan.com. Given that the changes to interest deductibility will, in effect, increase the cost of borrowing for leveraged buyouts, it\u2019s almost inevitable that prices paid to sellers will come down. (Where Congress\u2019s sudden aversion to debt came from is not clear, but it also extended to mortgage interest. Thanks to the new law, homeowners are now only able to deduct interest on mortgages up to $750,000; the marginal interest paid on a larger mortgage will no longer be deductible.)\n\nThere are other changes as well that will affect the buyout business. Whereas in previous years, private equity partnerships could get lower long-term capital gains tax treatment after owning a company for only one year, the new tax law requires that buyout firms hold their companies for three years before getting the lower capital gains tax treatment. That shouldn\u2019t be too onerous. It\u2019s fair to say that most buyout firms do end up owning their companies for at least three years. (It could hurt hedge funds, though, which generally prefer shorter holding periods.)\n\nThe good news for buyout moguls is that Congress left alone their cherished loophole on carried interest, the percentage of an investment\u2019s gains that a private equity partner takes as compensation. The provision allows that income to be taxed at the lower capital gains rates rather than at ordinary income rates. It\u2019s that tax that favors capital over labor and that allows, say, Warren Buffett to pay a lower tax rate than his executive assistant does. The only change to the \u201ccarried interest treatment\u201d for buyout firms under the new tax law is that companies have to be owned for three years instead of one.\n\nThe private equity industry, especially the bigger firms that like to use lots of leverage to goose their equity returns, cannot be happy about these changes to the tax code. Some analysts have taken note. \u201cThis change to the tax code will take a bite out of the bottom line of heavily leveraged Main Street companies owned by private equity firms and will reduce the incentives of these firms to overload the companies in their portfolios with debt,\u201d observed Eileen Appelbaum, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \u201cThis is a curious development considering the lobbying effort to defeat this provision and the large number of PE big shots in positions of influence in the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nBut the industry\u2019s lobbying arm is doing its best to put a good spin on the unexpected changes. In a statement, Mike Sommers, the president and chief executive of the American Investment Council, wrote me that it \u201ccommends Congress for its pro-growth, comprehensive tax law. Tax reform is challenging, and this new law requires some trade-offs from all sectors of the business community, including private equity. While we advocated against changes to the tax treatment of carried interest capital gains, we feel the three-year holding period will continue to support long-term investment. The new limitations to interest deductibility will impact all industries that need debt to help finance growth, but we are encouraged that the provision remains a part of the tax code.\u201d\n\nThere will be unintended consequences of the new tax, that\u2019s for sure; only time will tell how severe they will be.", "title": "Why Private Equity Isn\u2019t Cheering the Tax Overhaul", "authors": ["William D.

But that explains less than half of the spending growth. After accounting for those kinds of demographic factors, which we can do very little about, health spending still grew by about $574 billion from 1996 to 2013.\n\nDid the increasing sickness in the American population explain much of the rest of the growth in spending? Nope. Measured by how much we spend, we\u2019ve actually gotten a bit healthier. Change in health status was associated with a decrease in health spending \u2014 2.4 percent \u2014 not an increase. A great deal of this decrease can be attributed to factors related to cardiovascular diseases, which were associated with about a 20 percent reduction in spending.\n\nThis could be a result of greater use of statins for cholesterol or reduced smoking rates, though the study didn\u2019t point to specific causes. On the other hand, increases in diabetes and low back and neck pain were associated with spending growth, but not enough to offset the decrease from cardiovascular and other diseases.\n\nDid we spend more time in the hospital? No, though we did have more doctor visits and used more prescription drugs. These tend to be less costly than hospital stays, so, on balance, changes in health care use were associated with a minor reduction (2.5 percent) in health care spending.\n\nThat leaves what happens during health care visits and hospital stays (care intensity) and the price of those services and procedures.\n\nDid we do more for patients in each health visit or inpatient stay? Did we charge more? The JAMA study found that, together, these accounted for 63 percent of the increase in spending from 1996 to 2013. In other words, most of the explanation for American health spending growth \u2014 and why it has pulled away from health spending in other countries \u2014 is that more is done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, they\u2019re charged more per service, or both.\n\nThough the JAMA study could not separate care intensity and price, other research blames prices more. For example, one study found that the spending growth for treating patients between 2003 and 2007 is almost entirely because of a growth in prices, with little contribution from growth in the quantity of treatment services provided.

But many economists said that those steps were late, and that they left much work to be done to ensure fairness for women in the field, where the rate of entry for women lags that of math, engineering and other hard sciences.\n\n\u201cThe time had come for the organization to make a more proactive statement,\u201d said Peter L.

He cast the decision as responding to evidence in a way that was natural for the profession. \u201cEconomists, I think, are just very objective in their view of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nIn interviews during and after the conference, prominent women in economics described how their profession throws barriers in their professional paths, and they criticized the male-dominated leadership in the field for moving slowly to tear those barriers down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t know what is implicit bias.

Before this year\u2019s conference, two economists \u2014 Heidi Hartmann, the president of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, and Michael Reich, a labor economist at Berkeley \u2014 circulated a petition calling on the association\u2019s leaders to establish their own job market website where comments would be moderated and sexist postings blocked. The petition was eventually signed by more than 1,000 economists, and, on Friday, the association agreed to start its own job site.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI see this as a big deal,\u201d Abigail Wozniak, an economist at Notre Dame who was active in advocating a new job market site, said by email. \u201cI think the reaction of the A.E.A. was driven in part by a recognition that economics can become more inclusive on a number of dimensions.\u201d\n\nJanet Currie, chairwoman of Princeton\u2019s economics department, and Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard, pointed to a recent study that found that women get significantly less credit than men when they co-write papers with them, as reflected in the way the paper affects their chances of receiving tenure.\n\nWhen the co-author is a man, \u201cpeople don\u2019t say anything about it, it\u2019s just normal,\u201d Ms. Currie said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a woman, it\u2019s: \u2018Oh, everything she wrote is with co-authors.

It happens a lot.\u201d\n\nSarah A. Jacobson, an environmental economist at Williams College, recounted an experience during graduate school that she said was indicative: A well-respected female economist delivering a talk at her department was repeatedly interrupted by male economists when trying to answer questions from the audience.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the seminar, a male economist I respect turned around \u2014 they\u2019re in the audience \u2014 and they were explaining the answer for her, on her behalf,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said.\n\n\u201cYou see it all the time,\u201d she added. \u201cYou occasionally see it if a male is presenting. You see it pretty often if a woman is presenting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nKate Bahn, an economist at the Center for American Progress, said that when she was in graduate school, she was told she was not invited to a regular poker game with her male cohorts, because it included \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d She also noticed that her specialties, labor and gender economics, were viewed as more associated with women, and thus less rigorous.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat there really needs to be is a broader cultural change,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Hengel, the University of Liverpool economist, used readability tests to conclude that papers written by female economists are on average up to 6 percent better-written than those of men, and that those by women languish in peer review a half-year longer than those of men.\n\nShe became interested in the topic as a graduate student, she said, when watching a male friend teach a course and noticing the difference in how students reacted to him compared with how they reacted to her.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re teaching something, when you really nail an explanation, the front row just lights up,\u201d she said. But she watched her friend\u2019s class light up, \u201ceven though he wasn\u2019t nailing it.\u201d\n\nMs. Sharpe, of the N.E.A., said the bias against African-American women, who continue to make up a tiny slice of the economics profession, was especially pronounced. Ms. Sharpe\u2019s data show that only 52 black women earned economics doctorates between 2006 and 2015, a slight increase from the 46 who earned them in the previous decade.\n\n\u201cAll of this conversation about misogyny with women is not having a conversation about black women,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of us as the incredible invisible woman.\u201d\n\nMs. Stevenson\u2019s analysis of the seven leading introductory economics textbooks found that female economists were all but invisible. More than 90 percent of real-world business leaders mentioned in the books were men. Three in five fictional characters whom the authors invented to illustrate a concept were men.\n\nOnly 6 percent of the policymakers referred to in the textbooks were women.

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "The problem with lying, obfuscation and making excuses, though, is that one is often forced to tell more lies, cloud the truth, make more excuses. These words from Mr. Trump are a blight on this nation, a dagger in the very heart of what we claim to be \u201cnoble\u201d about America, a verbal drone fired at our fragile democratic experiment. And if we are honest, we will agree that the national and international damage done by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent white-racist virulence is a heavy moral price to pay, a profound moral tragedy. And for those who remain silent, you also stand accused.\n\nWith his latest display, Mr. Trump has pulled deeply from the white-racist imagination. \u201cShithole\u201d refers either to a toilet or the anus. Then again, in Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth, it could mean both. So, let\u2019s get this right. Places like Haiti, El Salvador and African countries are indicative of places where feces are deposited or places from which feces are expelled. Either way, Haitians, Salvadorans and Africans function, in Mr. Trump\u2019s white racist imaginary, as \u201cdirt,\u201d \u201ccrap,\u201d that which \u201cstinks,\u201d is \u201cfoul\u201d and \u201cnasty,\u201d that which causes us typically to recoil.\n\nThese are the people who bring with them \u201ccontamination,\u201d (Haitians who \u201call have AIDS\u201d) which functions as a trope for uncleanness, pollution, corruption. This supports Mr. Trump\u2019s white nativist narrative regarding making America great again; it is to make America white, \u201cpure,\u201d \u201cclean,\u201d \u201cunsullied\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d again. It is not by accident that those who Mr. Trump prefers are from Norway. After all, for Mr. Trump, they are \u201cpure,\u201d \u201cclean,\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d \u2014 tropes for whiteness.\n\nMr. Trump could have taken this from a Nazi handbook. Nazi ideology embraced Nordicism, which held that whites in Northern Europe were \u201csuperior,\u201d \u00dcbermenschen. Clearly, Mr. Trump, like Hitler, has a preference for Nordic types. This isn\u2019t just ignorance on the president\u2019s part; this is moral transgression of the highest order. As Dr. Ibram X. Kendi powerfully pointed out in The Times yesterday, Mr. Trump is clearly not the first racist president, but we should rise up now to demand forcefully that this ideology has no place in the Oval Office.\n\nThen again, philosophically, Mr. Trump is not far-off from the anthropological \u201cgenius\u201d of Immanuel Kant who, in \u201cOn the Different Races of Man,\u201d held that the first race, which was obviously white, was \u201cvery blond (Northern Europe), of damp cold.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Kant held that black people, because they are black, are stupid. These are the same black people whom Mr. Trump characterized by saying: \u201cYou live in your poverty, your schools are no good. You have no jobs. What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d The answer is clear: Our souls to a racist.\n\nStrange, isn\u2019t it? From the \u201cshithole\u201d of Africa, human life evolved. I guess Mr. Trump knew this, though. After all, he is \u201ca very stable genius.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist Joel Kovel wrote that \u201caversion is the cardinal manifestation of modern American racism.\u201d This is why we had de jure segregation. White people didn\u2019t want to be \u201ccontaminated\u201d by black bodies by mixing with \u201cbad blood.\u201d White people expressed an aversion toward those of us who were racialized as black. We were considered \u201cdirt\u201d; stuff that needed to be removed, kept in its place. Like a shithole, like feces. It is better to be flushed away, kept at a distance. White people refused to touch Black people unless it was on their white perverse terms. Like feces, we were expelled from white spaces, we were deemed \u201cuncivilized\u201d (meaning, not white). Mr. Kovel added: \u201cOf all prejudiced-against people, none have suffered the appellation of filthiness so much as Negroes.\u201d\n\nTragically enough, Kant, our towering philosopher of the Enlightenment, also held that \u201call Negroes stink.\u201d As the scholar Jan Nederveen Pieterse notes, \u201cIt is no wonder then that soap became both a symbol and yardstick of civilization.\u201d Dove advertisers should have known this history.", "title": "Opinion | Will America Choose King\u2019s Dream or Trump\u2019s Nightmare?", "authors": []}

As the United States takes in far fewer refugees, Americans have lost the moral credibility to insist that those countries continue to take in asylum-seekers.\n\nThe limits to refugee resettlement were imposed, ostensibly, to protect national security. Mr. Trump tweeted just this month that further limits to immigration were necessary for security.\n\nIn reality, as an analysis by the conservative Cato Institute reveals, 78 percent of all murders in terrorist attacks in the United States since 2002 have been perpetrated by native-born Americans. Refugees, who are subjected to a more thorough vetting process than that of any other visitors or immigrants, have not taken a single American life in a terrorist attack since the Refugee Act of 1980 was passed into law.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders mandated a report on the fiscal impact of refugee resettlement. But the administration never released that report, perhaps because the results did not suit its agenda.\n\nA draft of the report from the Department of Health and Human Services obtained by The New York Times found that, over the past decade, refugees have contributed $63 billion more in government revenues than they cost. That\u2019s consistent with the findings of economists, such as a recent study that found that refugees, on average, are paying more in taxes than they receive in governmental services and benefits by the ninth year after arrival.\n\nThe past year has been a disaster for refugees and for those of us who are deeply concerned \u2014 many because of the convictions of our faith \u2014 with their well-being.

{"date": "2018-01-10 00:00:00", "text": "Then again, Levitsky and Ziblatt are political scientists, for whom being a serial norm breaker is serious stuff indeed. Norms are what have sustained American democracy \u201cin ways we have come to take for granted.\u201d They identify two in particular: \u201cmutual toleration,\u201d or the understanding among competing parties and politicians that they are legitimate rivals rather than existential enemies; and \u201cforbearance,\u201d or the understanding among politicians that just because they technically have the power to do something doesn\u2019t mean they ought to use it. The erosion of these two norms can lead to a partisan death spiral. The authors argue that Trump has tried to eviscerate both.\n\n\u201cHow Democracies Die\u201d is a lucid and essential guide to what can happen here. Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies have collapsed elsewhere \u2014 not just through violent coups, but more commonly (and insidiously) through a gradual slide into authoritarianism. Autocrats often come to power through democratic elections rather than at the point of a gun. Establishment elites can inadvertently assist would-be despots, as insiders delude themselves into believing they can invite an outsider into power and then pull the puppet strings. As one German aristocrat boasted in 1933: \u201cWithin two months, we will have pushed Hitler so far into a corner that he\u2019ll squeal.\u201d\n\nImage Steven Levitsky, left, and Daniel Ziblatt. Credit Stephanie Mitchell\n\nA \u201cprofound miscalculation,\u201d is how Levitsky and Ziblatt describe this attempt to share power with the Nazis. When presenting the most distressing historical analogies, the authors\u2019 understatement is so subdued it verges on deadpan. But our current moment is so fraught that \u201cHow Democracies Die\u201d is never dull, even if the writing can be. \u201cIf partisan animosity prevails over mutual toleration, those in control of congress may prioritize defense of the president over the performance of their constitutional duties.\u201d This might be blanched prose, but it also sounds like a sly subtweet of the Republican Party.\n\nIn one of the most original turns in the book, Levitsky and Ziblatt assiduously dismantle the myth of American exceptionalism. Even during the supposed heyday of 20th-century bipartisan cooperation, \u201cthe norms sustaining our political system rested, to a considerable degree, on racial exclusion.\u201d Jim Crow was allowed to flourish in a South that was \u201cprofoundly undemocratic.\u201d The post-Confederate states had changed their constitutions and laws to deprive African-Americans of the vote, while Democrats and Republicans found common cause in a political system that was largely restricted to white people.\n\nThe authors hazard that most of the norm-breaking in the last few decades has been conducted by the Republican Party because, unlike its rival, it \u201chas remained culturally homogeneous.\u201d The Democrats have had to negotiate among varying interests in their ranks; the Republicans have not, allowing them to be more single-minded \u2014 and reckless, this book suggests \u2014 in their pursuit of power. But Levitsky and Ziblatt oppose those liberals who advise compromising the concerns of ethnic minorities in order to make Democrats more appealing to Trump\u2019s white working-class base: \u201cIt would repeat some of our country\u2019s most shameful mistakes.\u201d\n\nEach of these books ends on a characteristic note. Frum has prepared us for a grand finale, full of clashing cymbals and swelling violins: \u201cWe are living through the most dangerous challenge to the free government of the United States that anyone alive has encountered. What happens next is up to you. Don\u2019t be afraid. This moment of danger can also be your finest hour as a citizen and an American.\u201d This kind of exhortation is as vague and bombastic as old calls for regime change in Iraq. Levitsky and Ziblatt are drier and more circumspect. There is no democratic paradise, no easy way out. Democracy, when it functions properly, is hard, grinding work.

The demonstrators felt invincible: Their numbers had swelled night after night despite orders from the authorities to withdraw. They chanted slogans demanding more freedom; \u201cDeath to the Dictator,\u201d a reference to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who still has the final word on all state matters; and \u201cForget About Palestine, Give Us a Thought,\u201d to express their anger at their country\u2019s foreign policy, which came at a cost to domestic investments that could have created jobs for unemployed youth.\n\nLater that night, the protests were crushed. I watched members of the Basij, the paramilitary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, beat and stab civilians. I\u2019ll never forget seeing two Basij soldiers throw the limp body of one young man into the trunk of a car. By 3 a.m., the vigilantes were drumming on their trucks in a show of victory. Hundreds of protesters had been arrested and tortured.\n\nAs I followed news of the protests in Iran last week, I remembered that July night.\n\nEven more than the Green Movement of 2009, the recent protests \u2014 and the reaction to them \u2014 recalled those of the early 2000s. Both then and now, moderate political forces controlled Iran\u2019s presidency and its Parliament. And in both cases, the country\u2019s conservatives deployed intimidation, violence and deceit to undermine the moderates.\n\nThe question now is whether the conservatives will succeed in dominating politics and crushing the Iranian people\u2019s desires for reform. This time, they have some help on the world stage \u2014 from an American president with a prolific Twitter account. But they also face a persistent challenge: The people seem more determined than ever.", "title": "Opinion | Will Iran\u2019s Protests Help the Hard-Liners?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "In a pretrial request last year, prosecutors asked Judge O\u2019Neill to allow testimony from 13 other female accusers. The judge would only allow one of them to join Ms. Constand in testifying. On Thursday, the prosecutors, citing a fresh legal argument, asked him to reconsider and allow testimony from all those women, plus accounts from six more.\n\nOrdinarily, prosecutors cannot introduce evidence or accusations of prior bad behavior from other cases because a jury is supposed to focus on the facts of the case before it. But Pennsylvania, like other states, allows for corroboratory statements if they show intent or conduct so similar it can be argued that it demonstrates a common scheme or plan, a kind of unique signature of the defendant. In this case, prosecutors say the various accounts match Ms. Constand\u2019s in that all the women say they too were given an incapacitating substance and then assaulted.\n\nDuring the first trial, the defense hammered at Ms. Constand\u2019s credibility and argued the sex had been consensual. The other woman who testified, Kelly Johnson, said Mr. Cosby had attacked her in a hotel bungalow in Los Angeles in 1996 after having her swallow a large white pill, but she seemed hesitant on the stand.\n\nOnce deliberations began, jurors asked for a definition of several terms like \u201cunconscious\u201d as they sought to parse Ms. Constand\u2019s testimony, in which she said she had woken intermittently during what she called Mr. Cosby\u2019s assault.\n\nProsecutors seemed to take note of that issue Thursday as they argued for the introduction of additional witness testimony, saying it would \u201cestablish that an individual who, over the course of decades, intentionally intoxicated women in a signature fashion and then sexually assaulted them while they were incapacitated, could not have been mistaken about whether or not Ms. Constand was conscious enough to consent to the sexual contact.\u201d", "title": "Will the #MeToo Moment Shape the Cosby Case?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "The powerful Father Karadima had spiritually groomed thousands of Chileans in the ruling elite, including many who were major sustainers and accomplices of Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who misruled the country from 1973 to 1990.\n\nA Vatican investigation in 2011 found Father Karadima guilty of sexual abuse. Investigations by journalists found evidence of financial corruption as well. He had accumulated a fortune for himself and his family by bilking his followers.\n\nFather Karadima was not the only Chilean or Latin American priest to be accused of abuse. Yet authorities in the Catholic Church turned a blind eye. Among those suspected of ignoring the assaults by the priests was Juan Barros Madrid, whom Pope Francis named Bishop of Osorno, a city some 500 miles south of Santiago, despite vocal protests from people in the diocese. Father Barros was the disciple and right-hand man of Father Karadima.\n\nWhen Father Karadima was found guilty by a Vatican commission, he was not defrocked but ordered to spend the rest of his life in prayer and penitence. But although the Vatican barred him from celebrating Mass in public, he has been photographed doing so. And he certainly has shown no signs of repentance, even declaring his innocence in court.\n\nChileans of all kinds see the way the pope addresses the Karadima case as a litmus test. Pope Francis will be welcomed in Chile as a reformer, as an important voice for the vulnerable and the neglected. The faithful and the nonbelievers alike respect the Catholic Church because some of its most prominent leaders championed human rights during Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship, defying threats, death squads and persecution.\n\nAnd yet the daring Chilean church is now scarred and discredited by Father Karadima\u2019s depredations, by the fact that he was sheltered by those who should have judged and punished him. A criminal case was opened, as in almost 75 other cases of priestly abuse, but the judges indicated that the statute of limitations barred them from indicting Father Karadima.\n\nPope Francis needs to deal with this lack of accountability and justice in the next few days. He should see this crisis as a great opportunity for him, even as a form of redemption for his silence in Argentina during its years of tyranny and horror, a silence that has reportedly caused him anguish and remorse.\n\nBy siding with the victims of the church rather than with its conservative and self-serving hierarchy, by publicly condemning Father Karadima by name and denouncing each of those who shielded this malefactor, Pope Francis could, during this visit, help exorcise our ghosts and salve the wounds of Chile. Or does he want to leave the country without having been true to the liberating message of Jesus?", "title": "Opinion | Will the Pope Address Sexual Abuse in the Chilean Church?", "authors": []}

Seeing the disarray around the bank\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan on television, he ordered that the building\u2019s large garage doors be opened and that shelter and medical care be provided to those fleeing the disaster. Within 24 hours, he was behind his desk on the building\u2019s 10th floor.\n\nHe also guided the New York Fed through the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the institution\u2019s preparations for guarding against a so-called Y2K computer-driven market failure at the onset of the year 2000. He spent the last day, and night, of 1999 at Fed headquarters to ensure there were no glitches.\n\nWilliam Joseph McDonough was born on April 21, 1934, on Chicago\u2019s West Side to first-generation immigrants from Ireland. His mother died when he was 10, and his father, who sold insurance, died within a year. He was sent to live with an aunt, but had to fend for himself financially by delivering newspapers.\n\nHis three sisters chipped in to pay tuition for his first year at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien, Wis. He finished first in his class four straight years. The distinction earned him admission to the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, Mass., where he graduated in 1956. He received a master\u2019s degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1962. Later, he served in the Navy, and then joined the State Department, where he became fluent in Spanish and French.\n\nIn 1967, while serving as a diplomat in Uruguay, he met the chairman of the First National Bank of Chicago, who, impressed with Mr. McDonough\u2019s mix of math skills and international polish, offered him a job.\n\nHe rose to vice chairman before retiring in 1989 at 55. He arrived at the New York Fed after another serendipitous encounter: sitting next to E. Gerald Corrigan, the institution\u2019s president at the time, on a plane in 1992. Mr. Corrigan soon asked him to join the New York Fed as head of markets.

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "R. T. Rybak was the mayor of Minneapolis for 12 years, including when the City Council narrowly approved contributing $150 million to build U.S. Bank Stadium. \u201cI hate sports economics, but I love my city,\u201d he said, \u201cand we ended up crafting a deal that ended up being a financial bonanza for Minneapolis.\u201d\n\nHe explained that in addition to helping build U.S. Bank Stadium, the deal also fixed up the Target Center arena and provided funds to operate the convention center. It also spurred Wells Fargo to build two office towers near the stadium and has led to immense development in the Downtown East neighborhood, though the construction mirrors a trend seen across the country and cannot be credited simply to construction of the new stadium.\n\n\u201cI would not have done a deal just for the football stadium,\u201d Rybak said, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t build a stadium for the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nGood thing he didn\u2019t. When cities bid to host the Super Bowl, they agree to an extensive list of specifications, which include providing goods and services worth millions of dollars to the N.F.L., all at no cost to the league. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis obtained a copy of the 153-page bid book the N.F.L. sent to prospective hosts, and the bid committee told The Star Tribune it had agreed to a majority of the conditions laid out, thought it did not specify what it had rejected.\n\nThe bid book shows the host city must provide the N.F.L. with 35,000 parking spaces, thousands of hotel rooms, hundreds of buses and limousines, billboards, security, food and an exemption on paying all sales taxes, among hundreds of other specifications.\n\nThe phrase \u201cat no cost to the N.F.L.\u201d appears in the book 65 times.\n\nAll of these costs, at least in theory, are borne by the host committee. Minneapolis raised $30 million in pledges from the private sector before even bidding on the Super Bowl. According to Langley, of the regional economic development agency, the committee has now raised more than $50 million to put on the game. Enough is budgeted to pay for police overtime, emergency snow removal or any other cost overruns, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a really professional group,\u201d Langley said.\n\nIf so, it is the rare Super Bowl host committee that has budgeted for extras. The city of Santa Clara, Calif., had its costs to host the 2016 Super Bowl reimbursed, but the game cost nearby San Francisco almost $5 million, mostly in police and transit services. Mayor Jerry Weiers of Glendale, Ariz., told ESPN that the city lost money hosting the game in both 2015 and 2008. New Jersey gave the N.F.L. an $8 million tax break, and state-owned New Jersey Transit lost $5.6 million when the game was played there in 2014.", "title": "Windfall for Super Bowl Hosts?

That will make the league more entertaining and make baseball better, because we want to wake up every day and know that every team has an incentive to win, not an incentive to lose.\u201d\n\nSeveral divisions appear to have clear favorites: the Astros, the Indians, the Dodgers and the Washington Nationals all finished first by at least 11 games last season, and all look strong again. Those teams may feel little pressure to spend, and others may believe they are too far away for a free agent to make much difference.\n\nAnother factor is Boras, who represents Hosmer, Moustakas, Arrieta, Martinez, Holland and Gomez. He has waited until deep into the off-season before, finding deals worth more than $200 million for Prince Fielder and Max Scherzer in the second half of January. A slow-moving market does not worry him.\n\n\u201cFans know that talent is there,\u201d Boras said. \u201cThey know that without that talent, the probability of the team winning is dramatically altered. So I have always trusted the fact that the credibility of that ethic will serve both the teams and the players.\u201d\n\nOnce Boras\u2019s elite clients sign, perhaps, the rest of the market will sort itself out.

At Penn State, where a former football coach was found to be a serial child molester, those costs have reached nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.\n\nThe lawsuits and the legislative inquiries center on what Michigan State knew about Dr. Nassar\u2019s behavior during the two decades he worked there. Several victims have alleged that they had told Michigan State employees, as far back as the late 1990s, about being molested under the guise of treatment.\n\nIn 2014, after a complaint from a patient, the university conducted an internal investigation that cleared him, after which he continued to prey on more patients. On Thursday, ESPN reported that Michigan State had neglected to tell federal authorities, who were investigating the college\u2019s handling of other sexual misconduct complaints, about the 2014 case until the accusations against Dr. Nassar became widely known in 2016.\n\n\u201cI feel like every day we are peeling back another layer of a very deep mystery,\u201d said State Representative Adam Zemke, a Democrat who introduced a resolution that passed by a wide margin on Wednesday and called for the resignation of the university president, Lou Anna K.

Hours later, she resigned.\n\nMr. Zemke said he saw parallels between what happened at Michigan State and the \u201cwillful negligence\u201d during the water crisis in Flint, for which government officials have been charged with felonies and accused of covering up evidence.\n\nIn her resignation message, Ms. Simon wrote, \u201cTo the survivors, I can never say enough that I am so sorry that a trusted, renowned physician was really such an evil, evil person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe added: \u201cAs tragedies are politicized, blame is inevitable. As president, it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger.\u201d\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s deepening interest reflects the importance of Michigan State to the state and the realization that the scandal can easily become a political liability if not handled correctly. It has also become a subplot in this year\u2019s race for governor. Among those who have had a role in the investigations are two candidates \u2014 the Republican attorney general, Bill Schuette, whose office prosecuted the state criminal cases, and a Democrat, Gretchen Whitmer, who was the county prosecutor in Lansing during part of the time that Dr. Nassar was being investigated.\n\nBoth Mr. Schuette and Ms. Whitmer have faced criticism by some for their work on the case, and both have strongly defended their record.\n\nWhen The Detroit News wrote in an editorial this month that Mr. Schuette\u2019s \u201cindifference borders on dereliction of duty,\u201d he called for a retraction and said \u201cnothing could be further from the truth.\u201d And after a foe in the Democratic primary race suggested Ms. Whitmer did not act aggressively enough on the case, she said that she was \u201cproud of my record\u201d and that \u201cthis is an issue that is incredibly close to my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the system worked the way that it\u2019s supposed to,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said of the prosecution in an interview on Thursday.

His seven-day sentencing hearing drew more than 150 women, including Olympic gymnasts who are household names, to give wrenching testimony about what he had done to them.\n\nDozens of women, including gymnasts, swimmers, figure skaters, runners and basketball players, are now suing Dr. Nassar, Michigan State and U.S.A. Gymnastics, alleging abuse going back two decades. In court papers, they have said that they trusted Dr. Nassar because he was a renowned sports doctor, and the team physician for the United States gymnastics team.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of his patients said they complained to Michigan State employees, including the women\u2019s gymnastics coach at the time, Kathie Klages, in the late 1990s, according to court papers, but were met with disbelief. A lawyer for Ms. Klages has not commented on the allegations.\n\nIn 2014, a recent graduate filed a complaint against Dr. Nassar under Title IX, the federal law governing sexual harassment and assault on campus. She said that she had sought out Dr. Nassar for hip pain, and that he molested her and became sexually aroused until she removed his hands from her body, according to court papers in the civil cases filed against him.\n\nBut after consulting with other medical professionals, including Dr. Nassar\u2019s colleagues, the university\u2019s investigation concluded that his treatment had been \u201cmedically appropriate,\u201d the court papers said.\n\nThe abuse continued until 2016, when Rachael Denhollander, a former gymnast, told her story to The Indianapolis Star, and a police investigation soon began.\n\nOn Thursday, ESPN reported that Michigan State had failed to turn over its file on Dr. Nassar in 2014, when the Education Department was investigating unrelated complaints about the way the university had handled sexual assault and harassment cases. The university began turning over records in late 2016, ESPN reported, saying that the failure had been an oversight.\n\nOn Thursday, the education secretary said her agency would review Michigan State\u2019s handling of the complaints against Dr. Nassar. \u201cWhat happened at Michigan State is abhorrent,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cStudents must be safe and protected on our nation\u2019s campuses. The department is investigating this matter and will hold M.S.U. accountable for any violations of federal law.\u201d\n\nBut in a December letter to Mr. Schuette, the Michigan attorney general, the university\u2019s lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said he believed that evidence would show that no Michigan State official believed that Dr. Nassar committed sexual abuse before the newspaper reports in 2016. The university is also arguing that it cannot be held liable because of Michigan\u2019s sovereign immunity law, which protects state agencies from lawsuits in most circumstances and \u201cprotects the state\u2019s citizens by safeguarding its fiscal stability,\u201d the school said in a court filing.\n\nJohn Manly, a lawyer for some of the women in the civil cases, said the university\u2019s response to the lawsuits reminded him of the way the Roman Catholic Church had responded to allegations of child sex abuse by priests. \u201cIt\u2019s a page right out of the bishops\u2019 playbooks,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Michigan State is ruled to be not immune, the cost could be significant. One state representative, Klint Kesto, a Republican, said he has drafted legislation that would prevent state funds from being used for payouts. If that bill is passed, it would force Michigan State to use tuition or endowment money. \u201cThe school should use all its assets, all its income from other sources first before they go into the pockets of taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Kesto said.\n\nOn Thursday, Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat, called for congressional oversight and investigations of the scandal and said in a statement that it was \u201ctime for us to find out who is responsible at Michigan State University and U.S.A. Gymnastics for enabling and failing to stop this criminal.\u201d\n\nState legislators requested that university trustees provide investigative documents about Dr. Nassar dating back to 2014.\n\n\u201cIt is our sincere hope that the university will cooperate with our request and inquiries without the need to employ means of compulsion,\u201d the lawmakers wrote, adding that they may issue subpoenas if the records were not received by 5 p.m. on Feb. 9.", "title": "With Larry Nassar Sentenced, Focus Is on What Michigan State Knew", "authors": ["Mitch Smith", "Anemona Hartocollis"]}

Both families lost their homes after unemployment compounded the problem.\n\nIndeed, a home equity line of credit can often serve as gateway debt that threatens retirement goals, according to Milo M.

Then, they used the line for other things, even as their income fluctuated and they refinanced the entire mortgage to try to keep up. By the time they came to see him, they had to sell their home and move into an apartment in order to retire at all.\n\nPerhaps you have more self-control and work in a reasonably secure field.

Half of that will come from those 529 savings, another $4,000 to $6,000 per child will come from Ms. Mouer and her husband, and the girls will cover the rest with federal student loans.\n\nThe parents had planned to use a home equity line of credit to pay their share of the annual college bills all at once, and then repay the debt in full each year. They would capture one deduction on their home equity interest while getting another for deposits in their state\u2019s 529 plan.\n\nThe removal of the home equity deduction takes a bit of wind out of the Mouers\u2019 sails, but the family hopes to stick with the plan. At the same time, they are resolute about not threatening their own retirement security by reaching too high for expensive private schools that don\u2019t offer merit scholarships.\n\nAs for their daughters and their debt, it will be cheap, flexible federal student loans for them and nothing else, in part because one of the family\u2019s goals is to promote independence once college is over.

In a tweet posted on Sunday, she wrote, \u201cCute #TIMESUP pin James Franco,\u201d adding further details of her accusation.\n\nSarah Tither-Kaplan, another woman who criticized Mr. Franco that night, wrote in a Twitter post directed at him, \u201cRemember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn\u2019t exploitative because I signed a contract to do it?\u201d\n\nMs. Tither-Kaplan later told The L.A. Times that she felt pressured to appear nude in an orgy scene in Mr. Franco\u2019s yet unreleased film \u201cThe Long Home,\u201d and that other actresses who appeared in the scene wore plastic guards covering their vaginas that Mr. Franco removed before simulating sex acts with them.\n\n\u201cI got it in my head pretty quickly that, O.K., you don\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 to this guy,\u201d Ms. Tither-Kaplan told The L.A.

Contacted by The New York Times, representatives for the actor pointed to Mr. Franco\u2019s comments in late-night television interviews in which he said the women\u2019s tweets were inaccurate but that he supported their right to speak out.\n\nThe actress Ally Sheedy, who appeared in a 2014 Off Broadway production of \u201cThe Long Shrift\u201d that Mr. Franco directed, wrote in a Twitter post on Sunday, \u201cJames Franco just won.

She did not reply to a request for comment from The New York Times.\n\nMr. Franco, 39, has acted widely in films and TV shows, including \u201cFreaks and Geeks,\u201d \u201cPineapple Express,\u201d \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d which earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He currently stars in the HBO drama \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d playing dual roles as twin brothers in 1970s New York.\n\nIn a statement, David Simon, a co-creator of \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d said that after checking with fellow producers, \u201cwe have no complainant or complaint or any awareness of any incident of concern involving Mr. Franco. Nor has HBO been approached with any complaint. In our experience, he was entirely professional as an actor, director and producer.\u201d\n\nMr. Franco is also the director of \u201cThe Disaster Artist,\u201d as well as a prolific writer, stage performer and visual artist, and he ran a film and acting school called Studio 4 that closed last fall.\n\nIn 2014, he acknowledged that he had tried to pick up a 17-year-old girl on social media after images of their Instagram messages were circulated online.\n\nAt that time, Mr. Franco said in an interview with Howard Stern, \u201cThey make it out like I\u2019m pursuing young women. I\u2019m not going to high schools looking for dates. I\u2019m leaving my work and they\u2019re coming there. So, I\u2019m seeing attractive women.\u201d\n\nMs. Paley said she reached out to Mr. Franco in October after The New York Times published a report revealing that the film producer Harvey Weinstein had paid settlements to several women who accused him of sexual harassment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Paley said she called on Mr. Franco then to apologize to her and to other women who said he mistreated them. She said she did not receive an apology until several weeks later, when journalists from BuzzFeed began making inquiries about Mr. Franco\u2019s past behavior.\n\nIn a Tuesday appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Mr. Franco told the host Stephen Colbert, \u201cThe things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf there\u2019s restitution to be made, I will make it. I\u2019m here to listen and learn and change my perspective where it\u2019s off.\u201d\n\nAppearing Wednesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers,\u201d Mr. Franco said, \u201cI have my own side of this story, but I believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out enough that I will hold back things that I could say just because I believe in it that much.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd if I have to take a knock because I\u2019m not going to try and actively refute things, then I will, because I believe in it that much.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times canceled a public TimesTalks interview with Mr. Franco, scheduled for Wednesday. \u201cThe event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film \u2018The Disaster Artist,\u2019\u201d The Times said in a statement. \u201cGiven the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we\u2019re no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein.\u201d", "title": "Women\u2019s Accusations Follow James Franco After Golden Globes", "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"]}

Many marchers wore red scarves as a gesture of support for the large number of indigenous women whose murders or disappearances have received relatively little attention from the police.\n\nThe march, which began at the Parliament buildings, was one of about three dozen across Canada.\n\nAmong those who addressed the crowd in Ottawa was Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, who has been one of the leading international voices against President Trump\u2019s climate policies.\n\nLate last year, Ms. McKenna confronted a reporter from a right-wing Canadian news outlet, Rebel Media, over its repeated references to her as Climate Barbie. Earlier, a Conservative member of Parliament apologized for describing her that way on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI realized that when I spoke out in my small case of being called Climate Barbie \u2014 when I did it I felt better, but I also saw that so many other people stood up for me and they also felt empowered,\u201d Ms. McKenna said in an interview outside of a concert venue at the end of the march.\n\nAlthough Ms. McKenna credited Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who regularly describes himself as a feminist, for encouraging women to enter politics, she said their numbers still must increase, and not just in Canada.\n\n\u201cI really believe that we wouldn\u2019t have had an ambitious Paris climate agreement if we didn\u2019t have strong women negotiators,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the untold stories.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Rome, a Harvey Weinstein accuser received a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nThe actress and director Asia Argento, one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, has been mostly vilified by Italian commentators.

Mr. Chan, who voices a wise and venerable teacher in addition to playing the wise and venerable shopkeeper, doesn\u2019t really belong to the ninja genre. But neither do the young fighters who protect the city of Ninjago from an evil four-armed warlord named Garmadon, voiced by Justin Theroux. They prefer big, noisy machines to stealth, guile and swordsmanship. Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster.

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "Katharine from Rhode Island lamented the double standard girls and boys experience when given advice about their sexuality:\n\nIn my own experiences, I have not been pressured to send sexts. I know my case is not necessarily the norm, and I\u2019m lucky to say that. I\u2019ve definitely known of girls who have been pressured to send nude phtotos, even if they didn\u2019t want to. I found that in Rhode Island, an individual can spend up to 15 years in prison, and would be registered as a sex offender, if they possessed nude photos of a minor, even if they were a minor. I\u2019m more aware of the social ostracization that comes along with sending nudes. For women especially, sending nudes tends to result in the same sort of victim shaming that accompanies sexual assault. Basically, the sender is at fault in these interactions, for sending pictures to a person of questionable intentions. What this response fails to ignore is the unhealthy power structure between men and women. This is even more so evidence of men\u2019s sexuality being celebrated and excused, whereas women are encouraged to virtuous and pure, which leads to their sexuality being repressed. I think the best thing we can do as a society is to stop chastising women for being taken advantage of by men. I know this is easier said than done, but I think education can definitely be a weapon against sexual discrimination. Maybe this means altering our already lacking sexual education courses; I\u2019m not entirely sure. Still, I\u2019m hopeful for my generation, as we are increasingly more comfortable to acknowledge the faults with our society and try to repair them.\n\nFrancesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., emphatically agreed:\n\nThe article illustrated the problem of teenage sexuality and sexting very clearly, I think. I\u2019ve heard numerous stories about girls who were pressured by boys they may not even know to take and send nude photos, and how they were spread to others or used as blackmail. This is a truly illuminating example of how girls get the short end of the stick in situations such as these, because while a lot of advice given about sexting consists of warning girls not to take or send sexual photos, people don\u2019t think to look for the common cause of the problem: harassment. Such harassment is perpetrated because of the sexual power and status that men represent in our society, and is the root that stems to America\u2019s \u201crape culture.\u201d Girls are advised to not wear revealing clothing, never walk alone at night, to not get drunk, but rarely is it ever said: \u201cTry to not sexually harass anyone, please.\u201d Excuses such as \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and \u201cmen can\u2019t control their libido\u201d fuels and justifies much of the sexual harassment that some boys feel entitled to do.\n\nLola Calotychos from Providence, R.I., made a connection to the #MeToo Movement:\n\nI believe this article very accurately depicts the rising sexting culture the vast majority of teens habituate. Most people have developed a distorted sense of how personal and trusting they should be with others via their devices. I know numerous teens who have had their explicit photos secretly saved by the person they sent them to, and then sent around completely out of their control. Furthermore, I know of others who have had the photos saved to their family\u2019s iCloud, leading to unfathomably awkward conversations with their families. On a more important note though, these photos do put people at risk of legal trouble... even jail time in some cases. Moreover, I find it concerning that the statistics proving males\u2019 higher likelihood of pressuring girls for photos of this nature is so distinct. In light of all that is going on regarding sexual misconduct, in particular the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, it makes me think that \u2014 although it could not be entirely eliminated \u2014 the awareness of this issue could prevent this sexting issue, which is the \u201cnorm\u201d in today\u2019s world, from expanding into sexual harassment and assault such as molestation and rape.\n\nJanelly Polanco from Rhode Island spoke from personal experience:\n\nMy friends and I, unfortunately, been all asked for sexual pictures. The experiences in the article were, to some extent, more extreme than what I, personally, have experienced. The harassment or pressuring with no where to turn however is something I have experienced. This is what we consider \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cexpected\u201d when dealing with boys our age which, when taken into consideration, is a fail for our society. I am well aware of the social and legal consequences in regards to sexting or sending sexual photos. Although I have never been taught these consequences by a parent or teacher, media has showed me the extent of the punishment an adult could recieve when he or she is sexually involved with a minor. In society, girls are usually taught to cover themselves up or be able to defend themselves [against boys] rather than boys being taught to respect girls no matter the age. These different messages can conjure up the wrong ideas for both parties. I think parents and teachers, or adults in general should try to normalize sexting or at least acknowledge the expression sexuality in a positive, respectful light rather than leave it to the teenager to figure out for themselves. If sexuality was normalized, teens would be able to find outlets to express their sexting-related issues and ask for help.\n\nAngela from Rhode Island thought setting strict rules would not stop teenagers from sexting:\n\nI feel as though Adults should in a respectful and reassuring way state the consequences of sexting. When adolescents feel attacked I believe that that is the moment that kids act out and do as they please without thinking of how it may affect the future. However, I also believe that setting rules for asking and sending pictures would be ineffective because regardless of the amounts of rules given to kids, they will do what they want.\n\nHannah from Pennsylvania suggested adolescents share their experiences with others:\n\nKids need to be educated about how to say no to being pressured into sending those kinds of pictures, but much of the time they don\u2019t listen to a teacher standing at the front of an 8th grade health class. I personally haven\u2019t done anything like this, but I know the way that we are taught to not send pictures isn\u2019t very impactful. I think it would serve the purpose more to have kids and teens like themselves tell their stories about how they sent or received pictures, and their consequences. That way, it all seems more real to the kids. On the other hand, if there are kids already experiencing something like this, then they should be allowed to talk to someone without being judged or persecuted because of this. They should be able to get help without any reason to feel ashamed or embarrassed.\n\n_________\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nMany students who commented on our prompt \u201cCan You Spot a Liar?\u201d said they thought they would score high on the quiz, but then didn\u2019t do that well. Others scored high and were surprised at their results.\n\nLeah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., says being a terrible liar is beneficial, because it taught her the value of the truth:\n\nWow, I did worse than I thought I would on the quiz. I only answered 5 out of 10 correctly. On the five that I missed I was definitely skeptical of whether or not they were lying and continued to scroll back and forth between the \u201clying\u201d and not lying\u201d buttons. Generally I am a pretty trusting person, and I guess taking this quiz just further validated that. Eyes moving to one side, stuttering, and going into excessive detail or evidence about a subject can be clear clues of lying when trying to get away with something (which I find is one of the easier lies to detect). I am a terrible liar, even my siblings poke fun at me for it, but knowing I\u2019m a terrible liar has allowed me to see the value in the truth.\n\nAubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., made a New Year\u2019s resolution not to lie:\n\nI think a large part of detecting lies relies on how well I know the person. I would not feel confident detecting a lie a stranger told me, unless I was on very high alert for lies. However, once I become familiar with someone, I can recognize lies for what they are. Most people do something to give it away, for example, my brother\u2019s left eye has an ever-so-slight twitch to it in the midst of a lie. Some people also have a tendency to lie about a particular subject and exaggerate the topic. A lie worth the effort to tell is usually complex, which often results in a spider web of other supporting lies that can be hard to keep straight, leading to mix-ups and confusion. When I lie I usually do so to protect someone I care about from a truth that I think will hurt them, or because it is about something that is not my place to tell... One of my goals for the New Year was to stay away from all lies, including secrets. Lying is a way of taking the easy way that forces alliance with some and animosity with others. I am hopeful that avoiding not only lies, but rumors and gossip-which inevitably lead to lies- will allow me the opportunity to dig deeper in my relationships without the fear of getting caught in a lie or gossip.\n\nGilber V. from Chesterfield, Va., looks at facial expressions:\n\nLearning from the facial expression and the behavior of each person can be difficult when trying to detect lies. However, this quiz shows that sometimes you can accurately tell whether a person is lying or not just by paying attention to the eye movements, their confidence while talking, and their body language. These are important, yet subtle clues that can help you come to a final judgement, but it can also lead people to make misinterpretations because of the notion of having natural skills for detecting liars.\n\nAlexis Lariviere from Hoggard High School suggests looking at our own lies for clues, and thinks there should be a foolproof method:\n\nThink about all of the times you have lied in your life, there are probably too many situations to count! Everyone lies multiple times in their life, but the real question is can you detect it? As stated in the related article, trained professionals can only spot who is lying 61% of the time. What happens to the other 39% of people who are wrongly accused?When I completed the interactive quiz, I scored 7/10. Some clues that gave liars away were eye movements, shifting, and twitches. The only problem with looking for these clues is that when people do them, it does not necessarily mean they are lying. Some people glance around the room or move naturally and they could be completely honest. There has to be a better way for detecting the authenticity of a statement.\n\nRavi from Seattle tried the advice of an expert, and failed.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Every Body Says\u201d former FBI agent Joe Navarro explains his knowledge of body language after his career in counterintelligence. His technique is to spot people exhibiting self-comforting behaviors, like scratching their nose or twiddling their thumbs, which offset the discomfort of lying. I tried this technique on the quiz, but I scored 5/10\u2014I might as well have been guessing. Navarro makes it clear that you should never take suspicious behavior during one question as incontrovertible evidence that you are being lied to. Suspicious behaviors are signals that you should question a person further along those lines, and if your examinee continues to exhibit tranquilizing behaviors, there\u2019s a good chance that Disneyland isn\u2019t their favorite childhood memory.\n\nCheyenne Newkirk from Wilmington, N.C., scored high, and thinks the key is listening:\n\nOn the \u201cCan You Spot the Liar\u201d quiz I got all but one right, and to be honest going into this I would not have expected to get so many right. Most of them I had to take a good few seconds to figure out while others I could immediately tell if they were lying or not. I wouldn\u2019t consider myself that good at telling lies or even knowing when someone is lying to me but I will give myself credit for being observant.Out of my group of friends I\u2019m always the listener, the one you can come to with how you made eye contact with your crush, or how you had a terrible day. Whatever it is I like to listen, and I think that being able to spot a lie or just anything in general has a lot to with just listening.\n\nKayla Renee from Pennsylvania knows when someone is exaggerating:\n\nI would say that I can easily tell when a person lies to me, especially if I\u2019ve known that person for a while. Sometimes it\u2019s the little pitch change in their voice, other times they can\u2019t look me in the eye. Researches show that when most people lie they tend to look up to right, or if you ask them a follow up question and they hold their \u201cno\u201d or \u201cyes\u201d for a long time, it\u2019s most likely a lie. I don\u2019t notice those little things when I tell a little white lie, but my hands start to sweat when I\u2019m nervous. I can tell easily when someone is exaggerating, which leads to figuring out when someone is lying. I\u2019m a good liar spotter but if you line people up and ask me who is lying, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\n\nTiffany Morel from Rhode Island has newfound respect for professional lie-spotters:\n\nGrowing up in a household where I was told to never lie, having to tell whether or not someone was lying made me realise how much telling the truth has an effect on my daily life. While I might pride myself on telling the truth, paying attention to the body language of others has always come second nature to me. I don\u2019t stop to think if someone is lying or not, but rather just hope that they are being as honest as I am. That being said, while I was taking the quiz, having to stop and focus on whether or not someone may be lying was a bit tedious and made me earn a new respect for the people who have to deal with identifying liars on a daily basis. When taking the quiz, I based my questions on how the conversation made me feel rather than anything else and resulted in getting 9/10 on the quiz.\n\nSadie Gaffin from Providence, R.I., found it easy:\n\nI took the quiz and I received a 9/10 on it. It is usually pretty easy to detect a lie because the person will make obvious gestures. They might look at you and then look away often if they are lying, or they might leave out necessary details, or tell to many details. Also, a lot of the time the tone of voice they use will give it away. If there is passion in their voice, they are usually being honest, however if they sound monotoned, they may be lying. On the quiz, I could tell if someone was being honest because of their tone of voice and their eye contact with the camera.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSpace Travel\u201d brought in one short story, and several thoughtful comments that answered \u201cWhat story could this image tell?\u201d\n\nOlivia Lain from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., wrote the beginning of a short story:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad, we\u2019ll be back hours before the dust storm is supposed to hit. We\u2019ll be fine, we\u2019re always fine.\u201d My dad, geologist Luke Green of the latest NASA mission was always worried that my brother Johnny and I would get into some kind of trouble collecting rocks from far-off sites like we were doing today. I know that he grew up in a time when rockets blew up and space travel was fairly dangerous, but that sort of thing hadn\u2019t happened in years. Johnny and I hovered over to the location where we were supposed to collect our samples, and it was pristine from human impact. We were the first people over here, an experience that wasn\u2019t that uncommon with only 100 or so people on Mars at a given time. Johnny and I are filling up our containers and analyzing our samples when I glimpse something out of the corner of my eye. Something\u2019s is moving over there, but it\u2019s not because of the wind. I motion to Johnny and we get a closer look. It\u2019s a tiny, spider like creature about a half-inch in diameter. This is huge, life has never been found native to Mars, until this creature. \u201cKayla, what do we do?\u201d The question comes from Johnny, and we can\u2019t radio back to camp for some reason. We decide to put it in a container and bring it with us back to camp, but off in the distance, we see the dust storm approaching. We\u2019d spent too much time staring at the little creature, and now we couldn\u2019t even make it back to camp before the storm hit. What could we do?\n\nJalen Owen from Pennsylvania took a dark view of the future:\n\nThis tells a story of a post-apocalyptic future. Today, humans are obsessed with discovering new, complex forms of technology that can made our everyday lives better. However, one day, this machinery will developed too far from our power, and will start to become its own type of humanity. In the picture, we see a human-machine hybrid. This is something not too far from what scientist are trying to discover today. However, the man in the picture should watch his back because one day this machinery will developed feelings and intelligence on its own. And could start to turn on us.\n\nIN from KOP PA said time would tell:\n\nThis image could show our future. I believe that one day you will find families on vacation relaxing on Mars. The women has her bags which may represent how we may even be able to live in space or other planets. The man is holding some sort of technology. This may show in the future we will have technologies that are more advanced than they are today. On the other hand this may show people testing space or planets if they are safe to travel to, but we never. Time will tell.\n\nMitchell Boehling from Wilmington N.C., responded in detail to the article:\n\nIf Buzz Aldrin at 87 years old is still willing to spread that message of humanity reaching mars if only by modeling a fashion line then that should say something about him. As David Ben-David, said in the article \u201cBuzz was the man who gave us a taste of space in the sixties\u201d only further shows the affect that Buzz Aldrin has had on our society. Because he\u2019s such a large proponent of space travel to Mars it\u2019s a shame that all he can do is model for youths clothing lines. Perhaps if he was more in the spotlight then people in positions of power might decide to fund missions sooner to Mars whether than giving very little to NASA and watching space fall into the hands of private companies like Space X.\n\n__________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur popular Picture Prompt \u201cOprah for President\u201d brought in many emphatic \u201cyes\u201d answers, and equally emphatic, but fewer, \u201cno\u201d answers.\n\nHeather Tinsley from Wayne, Neb., was all in:\n\nAbsolutely. I would say that Oprah understands the power of her words and is able to foresee the impact they will make on her audience. To say that she has no political experience is an understatement. Her experience is different. There are many aspects of her career and lifeworks that support the requirements of a high public office that would impact a nation and the world. Any person who can navigate through military, social, political, entertainment, and family issues and be seen in a positive light should be given sound consideration.\n\nKatharine from Rhode Island agreed:\n\nFor Democrats, Oprah possibly represents a weapon against the Trump Administration; she is a powerful orator, a successful businesswomen, and is well-liked by the American public. Despite this, I would be wary to support her in 2020. Though I am well aware of her socially liberal stance, I am sure of little else. Similar to Trump, Oprah lacks the political experience I would want in a candidate. If Democrats want party unity and victory, I\u2019m not sure if this is the route they should take. However, if Oprah does get the nomination in 2020, in an attempt to appeal to the majority, I may feel obligated to vote for her, just to avoid the possibility of a second term for Trump.\n\nFrancis Batz-lux from Providence, R.I., likes Oprah\u2019s positivity:\n\nI think Oprah should run for the 2020 presidential election because she is such a powerful woman. She understands the struggles that families go through in order to put food on the table. As a child, she has seen how hard her own mother would work to make sure they don\u2019t go to sleep on an empty stomach. She will make sure that the power of the people is equally distributed and allow all people from all races to have a voice. Oprah is an inspiration for women everywhere and to become the first female president in history will make her the best role model for children everywhere. She will be able to tackle any political issue that is thrown at her and she will stand alongside the nation. This nation needs a strong leader who is willing to give their all to their people, a leader that will spread positivity rather than hate.\n\nCatherine B from Rhode Island is unsure:\n\nHaving a caring, strong, intelligent, and outspoken person in the White House is very important to many people. Although Oprah fits this description, her lack of experience within politics may be troubling for Democrats and Republicans alike. It would be amazing to have a woman- [and] an African-American- in the presidential seat, but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s the right fit for the job. If the DNC chose a candidate who fits these descriptions and has political experience, they would be much more successful in the long run.\n\nNyah Price from Providence, R.I., said no:\n\nOprah Winfrey\u2018s speech at the Golden Globes was both one of the most passionate and inspiring speeches that has been said in 2018. However it was just that inspirational, not presidential. I have nothing against Ms. Winfrey, but I don\u2019t think it would be wise for her to run in 2020. While she is a very well liked person and has the resources at her fingertips to run, she doesn\u2019t seem like the type to be in charge of our missile launch codes. I feel like Oprah is one known as someone who will take charge of the assignments she starts on, like her network. But how will that translate to running a country? We can\u2019t just give those who are at odds with America a car and expect everything to be smoothed over.\n\nTara Samtmann from Wilmington, N.C., gave a two-part answer to her \u201cno.\u201d Here is Part 1:\n\nOprah Winfrey is a very popular and well-spoken celebrity, who has captured the hearts and minds of millions of Americans, mostly women, for decades. She has been an advocate and supporter of women and women\u2019s rights, and many feel that she speaks for the people of America. But, if Oprah was to run for President, I feel she will capture a lot of attention, but for the wrong reasons. Her Presidential bid would become a media circus, even more than President Trump\u2019s campaign. But Oprah, similar to the President, lacks true government and military experience. Even though both are multi-billionaires and built their wealth on successful businesses, Oprah\u2019s rise to fame and fortune was 100% in the entertainment business. Due to this lack of experience, I do not feel Oprah should run for President.\n\nLola Calotychos from Providence, R.I., is undecided but hopes Oprah runs:\n\nIt has been established that Trump has little regard for ALL Americans, and has done nothing in hopes to unify the American people. Even after America experience a 5-year high jump in hate crimes after Trump\u2019s inauguration, he has not addressed the unjust stigmas fueling much of the hate throughout America. From the Black Lives Matter, \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, and DACA Trump has not motivated the American people to embrace one another, rather, he has fueled the hate culture we live in, and seemingly ok-ed acts such as the attack in Charlottesville. From what I know of Oprah, she is someone who has consistently emulated the importance of equality and truth. Ms. Winfrey has interviewed an abundance of people \u2014 people who she praises for their admirable actions, as well as people who she questions and tries to teach. No matter who she is interacting with, she remains openminded and just; treating everyone equally. These qualities embody the very values many Americans seem to have forgotten in recent times. Oprah\u2019s values and general intelligence would prompt the enforcement of the very words America was founded on: \u201cevery man is created equal.\u201d So would I vote for Oprah? I\u2019m not sure, I am not yet aware of other candidates and Oprah\u2019s stance on more complex political issues, however, I strongly hope she runs in the 2020 election. Oprah could revolutionize society.\n\nKaty from New Brunswick, N.J., joked:\n\n\n\nSure, but only if I\u2019d get a car! And you! And you!\n\nAnd Dave from Arizona said simply:\n\n\n\nIn a heartbeat!\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nCommenters weighed in with their interpretations of our \u201cStamps\u201d Picture Prompt.\n\n\n\nBrooke from Wilmington read it this way:\n\nThis picture represents the negative effects our labeling and quick judgement have on society. The most prominent illustrating detail that I notice is the fear overtaking the faces of these people as well as the blank expressions of those who have been labelled. Labelled people have become so accustomed to these assigned labels that they don\u2019t have the ardor to fight it anymore. Labeling has become such a huge function of our everyday society that people, myself included, can\u2019t walk into a room without automatically making assumptions about people they know nothing about. It is these assumptions that stop people from expressing who they truly are and I think that is a major message of this image. We need to stop making people feel like a stranger in their own body. We need to accept people as they are and judge them on their character and not how they present themselves. We need to respect people\u2019s decisions and not decide who someone is based on who they are physically. Stop the assumptions and the mislabeling, we are just destroying each other.\n\nEmma Weber from London noticed the colors:\n\nThis image portrays to me the negative effect labelling has on society. Stamps with \u2018HIM\u2019 or \u2018HER\u2019 in bold lettering litter the image, holding down several people. Blue and red are the only colours in the picture, reinforcing the fact that gender can be categorised by even colour. The people in black and white makes them seem secondary to the labels that have been placed on them, which reflects how often people regard others in terms of those labels and nothing else. Once you are labelled it is hard to shake off the perceptions that come with the label, and it is even harder to change labels; we can see in the image that those who have got a label are pinned to the ground by it, and seem to be somewhat resigned to their fate. Those who are not yet pinned down by a label are obviously agitated, and are trying to avoid the stamps. I would interpret this as those in society who are not as easily held down by a label, or do not think any label defines who they are.\n\nKayla Renee from Pennsylvania expanded its meaning to all kinds of labels:\n\nThis image reflects our society today, Labels. To label something is to assign that title to them or it. People are unfairly labeled with stereotypes everyday; the jock, the preppy kid, the nerd, the popular kid. Labels are dangerous and too commonly seen in our modern day lives, with gendering as well. Everyday whether we realize it or not, we assign genders to almost everything such as shoes or bookbags and clothes. On a daily basis people assume genders, this frustrates a lot of people in our society, and we could be offending them. This pictures depicts the dangers of a label, in the picture some of the people look afraid of the stamp/label and others just seem fine, as if they were accepting their fate and it\u2019s okay now. We are being crushed by these labels and they are starting to take over our lives. We need to strip ourselves of our labels and stop stereotyping people by the color of their skin, the length of their hair, or the clothes they wear. At the end of the day we are all humans and we all have feelings, let\u2019s treat each other how we would like to be treated.\n\nAnd Anandeep from Pennsylvania explained just how detrimental these labels can be:\n\nThis image shows how easily society tends to put labels on people. This can be based on their actions, looks, skin color, knowledge, or even wealth. The image emphasizes how these labels stick to a person and limit them to certain standards which are hard to escape. This could later influence how people see themselves and make it hard for them to completely express their true personality and potential since they practically have a foot being tied to a rope. Every time we use a labeling pronoun, it\u2019s like tightening the rope until the person really can not any longer willingly move on their own.\n\nZac Gill from Wilmington, N.C., made a connection to current events:\n\nIn my eyes, and probably the eyes of many others\u2019, this image is a commentary on gender labeling and how our society \u201cstamps\u201d everyone with what they deem acceptable. This comment is coming from an outsider who doesn\u2019t quite understand the world depicted by artist Eleanor Davis, but also by someone who hopes to learn more. Within this picture, a gigantic stamp is being brought down on some people labeling them either \u201cHim\u201d or \u201cHer.\u201d Everyone in the picture has a look of distressed showing that these labels probably aren\u2019t favored. This connects to our societies growing conversation on Gender labeling and growing division on being transgender. I agree with what\u2019s being said with this picture and hope for a more understanding country in the years to come.\n\nWhile Anna Cross from Wilmington, N.C., related to it personally:\n\nHow easy it is for someone to reject an entire person\u2019s identity when they\u2019re unable to feel and see through the eyes of the people they discriminate and ignore. The naive and disrespectful individual will say that it\u2019s \u201ctoo confusing\u201d or \u201cfrustrating\u201d to correctly address someone, but I can assure you it\u2019s far more frustrating to the person that has to deal with mislabeling and discrimination than it is for the protester who fulminates against the different genders and sexualities of others. Two of my friends came out as non-binary last year, but they\u2019re still uncomfortable with telling more than a handful of people about it. They worry about facing harassment and mockery if they tell anyone outside of the immediate friend circle, and while I respect their decision, I still wish this didn\u2019t have to be a concern. Too often society stamps a label on a person just because they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d how someone can be a they or change their gender. But you don\u2019t have to understand it, because only other non-binary individuals can know what it\u2019s like to be non-binary, and only transgender people can know what it\u2019s like to be trans (etc.). As a modern society in the pursuit of equality, we need to be more open-minded to our fellow humans, simply because like any other citizen, they deserve just as much respect and proper treatment as everyone else.\n\nMcKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., summed up the sentiments of many commenters:", "title": "World Travel, Oprah, Spotting Liars and Advice on Sexting: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "I have not had the opportunity to examine the president personally, but warning signs abound. What if I had reliable outside information that Airman Trump displayed erratic emotions? That I saw very clearly that he was engaging in cyberbullying on Twitter? That he had repeatedly made untruthful or highly distorted statements? That his language implied he engaged in sexually abusive behavior? That he appeared paranoid about being surveilled or persecuted by others, that he frequently disregarded or violated the rights of others?\n\nThese are the sorts of things that set off alarms for Air Force psychiatrists. I certainly could not certify him as \u201cP.R.P. ready\u201d without more extensive psychological evaluation.\n\nIt does not take a former Air Force psychiatrist to point out that our country finds itself in a place unlike any we\u2019ve ever been before. Saturday morning\u2019s alarm in Hawaii, as residents read alerts that incoming ballistic missiles were on their way, is a wakeup call to the very real danger we\u2019re facing. Global tension and angst are significantly heightened.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here a few times before, but unlike those other times our commander-in-chief adds, without equivocation, to this angst almost daily with his words and actions. We have always assumed that the person at the top has the mental fitness to meet whatever standards the Air Force set for the rest of the chain of command. What keeps me up at night? The realization that, at the worst possible time, we have a chief executive who I believe would probably fail the P.R.P.\n\nThe topic of presidential fitness and cognitive decline has always been a legitimate issue. The ability for the Executive Office to function effectively and without exposing the American people to undue danger relies on the mental faculties of the one person inhabiting its walls. Former President Jimmy Carter pointed this out in an article he wrote for The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1994, in which he warned that our country is in \u201ccontinuing danger\u201d from the possibility that a president could become disabled \u201cparticularly by a neurological illness.\u201d Revelations that President Ronald Reagan may have had early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s while he was president add to these concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the military will act on its own to require the president to submit to an Air Force psychiatrist\u2019s evaluation. But there are other options. A bill in the House, with support in the Senate, called the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017, explicitly prevents any president from initiating a nuclear first strike without Congressional approval. This should be common sense for any politician to support, because it assures that the checks and balances intended by the framers of the Constitution remain intact. But equally important, it remedies a glaring failure within the nuclear chain of command and mitigates one of the greatest dangers of our nuclear ages: the possibility of an unhinged president executing a calamitous decision that endangers millions of Americans, and potentially millions of others around the globe.", "title": "Opinion | Would the Air Force Let Airman Trump Near a Nuclear Weapon?", "authors": []}

It was also influential in the history of Alabama, where the slaves brought over on the Clotilda settled, creating what became known as Africatown in Mobile, after emancipation.\n\nThe saga, well-known locally, was introduced to a wider audience after it was featured in a November episode of \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d a television series in which the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. investigates the ancestry of his celebrity guests.\n\nIn that episode, Questlove, the drummer of the hip-hop group the Roots, which is also the house band for \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d found out more about his ancestors, who were smuggled to America aboard the Clotilda.\n\n\u201cAll types of emotions are running through my head,\u201d he said on the program. \u201cI feel sad. I feel angered. I feel confused.

Mr. Raines wrote that he believed previous explorers looked near the site he found but never exactly there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe investigation was prompted in September when Mr. Raines asked a friend for thoughts on what he should pursue next.

Rather than bashing the Chinese for stealing American jobs, he stuck to larger principles of fairness. The United States \u201cwill no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices including massive intellectual-property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a rational argument \u2013 and hints at something like leadership.\u201d\n\nWhat Salesforce C.E.O.

He said he wanted economy growing at 5 percent or 6 percent, according to our spies \u2014 and joked about maybe reaching 7 percent. (G.D.P. growth hit about 3.2 percent in the third quarter last year.

Many of the European corporate chieftains arrived at the dinner concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s provocative words about a possible trade war, his harsh treatment of immigrants, his skepticism about climate change, and his apparent disdain for international cooperation. But in the course of a conversation with the C.E.O.s, moderated by Gary Cohn, the dinner appears to have assuaged the worst concerns, leaving many convinced that Mr. Trump employs outrage as a negotiating tactic while pursuing pragmatic aims. \u201cThere\u2019s a very constructive mind-set in the Trump administration to find the best path forward,\u201d one attendee, Vas Narasimhan, the C.E.O. of Novartis, said.\n\nThe president is addressing the forum this morning.

Wynn Resorts shares plunged more than 10 percent on Friday afternoon, wiping $2 billion off the company\u2019s value, after The Wall Street Journal reported that such accusations had been leveled at the company\u2019s founder, chief executive, chairman and biggest shareholder, Steve Wynn. Mr. Wynn promptly dismissed the allegations to Reuters as \u201cpreposterous.\u201d The loss of value is a reminder to directors on all company boards that even an unproven suggestion of sexual harassment is now a financial risk.\n\nCasino companies face manifold pitfalls already. Wynn Resorts, which gets most of its earnings from operations in the Chinese enclave of Macau, is effectively a punt on the whims of politicians in Beijing, who mostly turn a blind eye to the 20 million citizens who flood over the border in a year to engage in activity forbidden back home. Wynn Resorts also faces a continuing lawsuit between Mr. Wynn and his former wife, Elaine, who is suing to regain control of a nearly 10 percent stake she currently cannot vote or sell. Mr. Wynn, in a statement, said it was the fight between him and his former wife that had started the allegations, underscoring the friction between the company\u2019s top two shareholders.\n\nAwareness has grown in the past six months as women \u2014 from boardroom executives to Hollywood stars to assembly-line workers \u2014 have started speaking out about workplace mistreatment. Executives haven\u2019t gone unscathed. Travis Kalanick resigned as Uber\u2019s chief executive last year in the wake of harassment allegations, among other problems. Unlike Uber, which worked through its own scandal in private, Wynn Resorts is exposed to the public ire of shareholders.\n\nThe question, though, is what specifically investors are now pricing in. One risk is that regulators make it difficult for Wynn Resorts to expand. The Massachusetts gaming watchdog said on Friday that it would review plans for a new casino in Boston.", "title": "Wynn Resorts\u2019 Slide Shows Sexual Misconduct Is a Financial Risk", "authors": []}

The Obama presidency talked down American greatness. In Syria, Barack Obama\u2019s abdication was complete. But through dereliction, President Trump has fast-forwarded this American retreat.\n\nOf course, mistrust of America\u2019s rivals is not misplaced. Russia and China, ideological foes, are in an assertive and expansionist mood. Russia has won in Syria. It has not retreated in Ukraine. European nations, including Hungary, have proved susceptible to Vladimir Putin\u2019s democratic authoritarianism. Russian cyberattacks on Western democracies have proved disruptive, especially in the United States.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China, in a speech late last year, offered his nation\u2019s model as \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d This amounted to a remarkable expression of self-confidence. It is of a piece with the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, an attempt to weave other countries\u2019 fates into China\u2019s growing ambitions.\n\nAs the Cold War demonstrated, such challenges to American interests are best confronted through coherent strategy backed by a credible threat of force and a clear set of values. This, however, is not Trump\u2019s thing. Value-free outbursts are. The president is \u201cso boxed in on Russia that he\u2019s deprived of any ability to conduct a policy, and that paralysis is dangerous,\u201d Jonathan Eyal, a London-based strategic analyst, told me. On nuclear weapons and on Syria, the United States has no mechanism for dialogue with Russia at the highest level because Trump is frozen in genuflection to Putin, his own National Security Strategy notwithstanding.\n\nWith China, too, policy has veered: trade bellicosity one moment, blandishments designed to enlist Beijing\u2019s help in squeezing North Korea the next. Xi, deploying pomp and flattery during the president\u2019s visit last year, knows how to get Trump where he wants him. America First makes China look like the more responsible global power. Tillerson labors to open diplomatic channels to Pyongyang; Trump tells his secretary of state he\u2019s \u201cwasting his time.\u201d In the end the confidence of both China and Russia is buttressed by Trump\u2019s wackiness and compromised hesitations.\n\nLast September, Trump met with Emmanuel Macron, the young president of France, who, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has a relationship with him. Syria came up. Trump said he\u2019d hit Syria with 50 missiles after the chemical-weapons infringement. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked his aides who, in cowering unison, confirmed he had. Iran came up. Macron, like other European leaders, is concerned that the nuclear deal Trump opposes be upheld. Trump was uninterested. He veered off on a bizarre tangent about the trade France does with Iran.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to do business with Trump \u2014 not least for those who serve him. This month offered the extraordinary spectacle of the United States ambassador to London, Woody Johnson, rebuffing Trump over the new American Embassy that the president had described as being in an \u201coff location\u201d and costing $1.2 billion. It didn\u2019t \u201ccost the U.S. taxpayer a cent,\u201d Johnson retorted. Trump was really looking for a reason to cancel a British trip that would have provoked protests.

His alleged partners had threatened to kill him, prosecutors say, and he had made threats in the past to take his own life.\n\n\u2018Money, greed, drugs\u2019\n\nWhen Damon G. Tyner took office last year as the Atlantic County prosecutor, he asked his staff to compile a list of unsolved homicide cases going back to 1970. They came back with about 120. Ms. Kauffman\u2019s was one his staff believed that, with a renewed investigation, they could \u201cmake some breaks,\u201d he said.\n\nIt quickly grew into something more complicated than a straightforward murder case.\n\nDoctors across the country have been accused of turning their practices into \u201cpill mills\u201d distributing prescription narcotics. In some cases, doctors have been charged with murder for overprescribing opioids, like fentanyl and oxycodone, to people who fatally overdosed. New Jersey, like many parts of the country, has been in the grip of the deadliest drug crisis in United States history. In Atlantic County, where Dr. Kauffman practiced, more than 160 drug-related deaths, many of which were from opioid overdoses, were recorded in 2016.\n\n\u201cAs big a figure April cut in this community, this case ultimately became larger than her,\u201d Mr. Tyner said in an interview. \u201cI think this was driven by pure narcissistic, sociopathic behavior that is underscored by money, greed, drugs \u2014 all of it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is unclear how the operation began, but Dr. Kauffman and Ferdinand Augello, a local leader of the Pagan motorcycle gang, were believed to be at the top, according to court documents. Dr. Kauffman would give prescriptions to people sent by Mr. Augello, investigators said. Mr. Augello had at least two recruiters who, in turn, would enlist more people who would turn to Dr. Kauffman for prescriptions for OxyContin.\n\nAs the narcotics operation was ramping up, however, Dr. Kauffman\u2019s relationship with his wife became increasingly fractured, prosecutors said. She wanted a divorce. To get it, she said she would spend as much money as she could until he relented, and she also threatened to expose Dr. Kauffman\u2019s drug operation. Prosecutors accused Dr. Kauffman of plotting to kill his wife rather than cede \u201chalf his empire.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe told Mr. Augello of the threat, prosecutors said. Mr. Augello started looking for someone he could hire to kill Ms. Kauffman, asking Pagans and others connected to the gang. It took him nearly a year. On the morning of May 10, 2012, prosecutors said, Francis Mulholland was given a gun and dropped off at the couple\u2019s house at the end of Woodstock Drive, where the door had been left unlocked. (Eighteen months later, Mr. Mulholland, 46, was found by the police on his living room floor, dead from a heroin overdose, the authorities said.)\n\nAfter her killing, prosecutors said, the drug operation continued for five years. Officials did not specify how much money the operation made, but according to court records, the proceeds were used to buy property in Arizona, cars, guns and guitars.\n\nBut it was effectively shut down in June, when investigators searched Dr. Kauffman\u2019s office and home as part of a broader drug-related investigation. At his office, the authorities said, Dr. Kauffman pulled out a handgun and threatened to kill himself, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to jail for this.\u201d He eventually surrendered and had been detained since.\n\nMr. Augello was also charged with first-degree murder and several others were accused of racketeering for their suspected part in the drug operation. Investigators claimed in court records to have conversations recorded by a confidential informant in which Mr. Augello discusses the drug operation and Ms. Kauffman\u2019s murder. In court, prosecutors also accused Mr. Augello of plotting to kill Dr. Kauffman over fears he had \u201cflipped on him.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Augello said he maintained his innocence.\n\nDr. Kauffman, who was moved to a jail outside of Atlantic County because of the threat, shuffled into a courtroom for a recent proceeding in an orange jacket and stared at the floor as prosecutors described the case against him. Louis M. Barbone, his lawyer, said Dr. Kauffman denied the charges and that it would become clear at trial that \u201cinstead this was a conspiratorial plot to kill Kauffman.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, a week after his court appearance, his body was discovered in his cell in the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J. Officials disclosed few details about the circumstances but said it appeared that Dr. Kauffman, who was 68, had apparently killed himself.\n\n\u2018She was a fighter\u2019\n\nOver the years, the void left by the stalled investigation was filled with conjecture. The gossip was incessant. Before the charges, little in the way of solid information had emerged. Her daughter and friends grew frustrated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting for five and a half years for justice,\u201d said Lee Darby, a close friend of Ms. Kauffman\u2019s. \u201cYou try to start figuring it out on your own.

Over time, as this habit has hardened, they have lost the knack and the muscle memory for legislating.\n\nIn fact, although everyone agrees Congress is broken, it has eschewed its dominant role for so long that even reformers disagree about what it is that Congress is failing to do in the first place \u2014 and what purpose institutional reform should serve.\n\nIs Congress\u2019s purpose to implement the agenda of the majority party most effectively, or is its purpose to compel and enable accommodations in a divided country? Today\u2019s Congress does neither very well. But which failure is a bug and which is a feature?\n\nThose two visions of Congress\u2019s purpose (which the political scientist Daniel Stid labels \u201cWilsonian\u201d and \u201cMadisonian,\u201d respectively) generally point in opposite directions when it comes to strengthening Congress, but they are too often confounded. The Wilsonian vision would have Congress function more like a European parliament, with stronger centralized leadership and fewer choke points and protections of minority prerogatives. It would enable the party that won a majority of seats to enact its agenda and see what voters make of it in the next election.\n\nThe Madisonian vision would recover the purpose of Congress in our larger constitutional system but would mean slow going, greater cacophony, less centralization and more opportunities for coalitions of strange bedfellows to form. It would have Congress serve as an arena for continuing bargaining and compromise, on the premise that greater social peace is better for the country than either party\u2019s bright ideas.\n\nA more parliamentary Congress has been the dream of progressive reformers for more than a century, but it is a poor fit not only for a system of divided powers but also for a polarized society. We need Congress to pursue and drive accommodations \u2014 in fact, as the political scientist Philip Wallach has recently argued, Congress is really the only institution in our system of government that could do that.\n\nReforms rooted in that vision would need to focus especially on the budget process, which has come to dominate and distort Congress\u2019s work. Making that process more like legislative work (divided into small, discrete, concrete steps that call for bargaining over particulars) and less like executive work (consolidated into a single, large decision that calls for unity around abstractions) would advance the Madisonian ideal of Congress and could mean rethinking elements of the committee system, the work of \u201cscorekeepers\u201d (like the Congressional Budget Office), the relationship between leadership and backbenchers, even the distinction between authorizing and appropriating that now too often separates policy priorities from budgeting.\n\nMany members of Congress would surely recoil from big changes like these.

Researchers compared identical twins \u2014 who have virtually identical DNA \u2014 to fraternal twins, and in study after study the educational attainment of identical twins tended to be closer than that of fraternal twins.\n\nThe recent revolution in DNA sequencing gave researchers a new way to study the link. In 2016, for example, researchers in England surveyed hundreds of thousands of people and linked 74 different gene variants to how long the participants stayed in school.\n\nSome of those variants were in genes active in the developing brain, perhaps influencing relevant traits \u2014 everything from how well people learn new words to how motivated they are by long-term goals.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the connection between genes and education remains murky. Each gene variant, on average, accounts for just a few weeks of the total. And when researchers try to estimate how important these variations are in entire populations, they end up with different figures. Some researchers estimate the proportion at 21 percent; others have put it at as high as 40 percent.\n\nEither figure means that a lot of variation cannot be accounted for by genetics. Factors in the environment may explain some of the variation: a family\u2019s wealth, for example, or the quality of schools children go to, or their exposure to pollution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the first DNA-based studies of educational attainment came out in 2013, a geneticist named Augustine Kong sifted through the results. At the time, Dr. Kong was working at DeCode, a genetics company based in Iceland, and so he was able to look for some of the variants in the company\u2019s database of Icelandic DNA.\n\nDr. Kong wondered if other researchers had missed something very important. \u201cIt suddenly occurred to me that part of this effect could be coming through the parents,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I got obsessed with the idea.\u201d\n\nChildren, after all, get their genes from their parents. It was possible, Dr. Kong reasoned, that genes could influence how far children got through school by influencing their parents\u2019 behavior rather than the actions of the children themselves.\n\nDr. Kong was well placed to test that idea. DeCode has genetic records for many of the island\u2019s 338,349 residents, including many pairs of parents and children. And among the questions that DeCode had asked its subjects was how many years of school they completed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Kong and his colleagues used a new method to measure the influence of genes on education. They didn\u2019t inspect individual variants to see if each clearly had an impact; instead, they added up the influence of hundreds of thousands of variants in people\u2019s DNA, even if they had a very weak influence at best.\n\nThe researchers compared 21,637 Icelanders to their parents. The parents, of course, passed down one copy of each of their genes to their children. Some of these might be related to educational attainment, and some not.\n\nBut Dr. Kong and his colleagues focused their attention on variants carried by parents but not passed to their children. These variants, the researchers found, predicted how long the children stayed in school \u2014 even though the children had not inherited them.\n\nAny single variant in the parents had a minuscule effect on the children\u2019s education. But combined, the researchers found, the untransmitted genes had a significant impact. Their combined effect was about 30 percent as big as that of the genes that the children actually inherited.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe direct genetic effect is quite a bit smaller than what people thought,\u201d said Dr. Kong, who now a professor at the University of Oxford.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow can that be? Dr. Kong speculated that the genes carried by parents influence the environment in which their children grow up. \u201cVariants that have to do with planning with the future could have the biggest effect on nurturing,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Harden expected that genetic nurture would turn out to be a very complex phenomenon. \u201cMy intuition is that it\u2019s not any one thing, but a constellation of things,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Dr. Harden and other researchers on human behavior hailed the study for revealing something new about nature and nurture, researchers who study animals recalled familiar echoes in their own work.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised by the findings,\u201d said Piter Bijma, who studies livestock at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. \u201cThese are to be expected.\u201d\n\nDr. Bijma and other researchers have amassed a wealth of evidence showing that animals are influenced not just by their own genes but by the genes of their parents. Calves may grow quickly thanks to their own growth-promoting genes, or because the same genes in their mothers make them produce more milk.\n\nA calf may inherit those milk-boosting variants from its mother. But just because the calf carries them doesn\u2019t mean they directly make the calves bigger.\n\nCompared to other mammals, Dr. Bijma observed, human children are especially dependent on their parents \u2014 not just for food and other essentials, but for social development. So it stands to reason that they\u2019d experience similar effects.\n\n\u201cHumans provide substantial care to their offspring, and so the nurture they create is very likely to have a genetic component,\u201d said Dr. Bijma.\n\nDr. Harden said that taking account of genetic nurture could improve research on the effects of poverty on how children do in school, as well as studies of methods to improve educational attainment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so obvious in retrospect, and so elegant,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people are going to say, \u2018I can see my data in a new light with this.\u2019\u201d", "title": "You Are Shaped by the Genes You Inherit.

His aim throughout the process, he said, was to write a book that felt like a film, and while the plotting came to him in an easy burst, the writing proved more of a challenge.\n\n\u201cGetting a character from a sofa to a window is surprisingly difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mallory, who describes himself as \u201cconstitutionally cautious,\u201d continued at William Morrow for another 15 months after the sale of his book, but his international publishers hoped to send him on a nine month world tour to promote \u201cThe Woman in the Window,\u201d and the draft of his second novel was due to Ms. Brehl.\n\nFive days before his book hit shelves, he had his final day at his desk job.\n\nWhile Mr. Mallory now describes himself as \u201csignificantly better off financially,\u201d he hasn\u2019t yet found the time to make use of his recent windfall.

LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES\n\nPop: Jen Cloher, Backed by Courtney Barnett\n\nJan. 30; roughtrade.com.\n\n\u201cIndie rock is full of privileged white kids/I know because I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Jen Cloher sings on \u201cShoegazers,\u201d a tart, bluesy highlight from the self-titled LP that she released in August. That crackling sense of humor drives much of Ms. Cloher\u2019s songwriting; she likes to lob accusations that, often as not, loop back into self-criticism. The album, her fourth, adds up to a persuasive case that, privileged as she and/or her audience might be, this Australian artist is one of indie rock\u2019s sharpest observers.\n\nMany American fans know Ms. Cloher as the romantic partner of the more famous Courtney Barnett, also an Australian indie-rocker. Ms. Cloher sings about that, too \u2014 some of her most poignant songs deal with the vexed intersections of fame and love. (See \u201cForgot Myself,\u201d the album\u2019s excellently sulky opener, or the softer-hued \u201cSensory Memory.\u201d) Expect the payoff to be high, musically and emotionally, when Ms. Cloher headlines Rough Trade NYC on Jan. 30, with Ms. Barnett playing guitar in her backing band.

{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThis is a situation that makes most doctors very uncomfortable,\u201d said Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cSome feel these drugs have been successful used in younger patients, so why not use them?\u201d\n\nSo why not? \u201cWe don\u2019t have good specific data for people without known heart disease over age 75,\u201d Dr. Lee said. \u201cAre statins helpful or harmful for them? The honest answer is, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTo be clear: Statins make sense for adults of any age who already have heart disease, who have suffered a heart attack or stroke, or who have had arteries unblocked with a procedure like stenting. This is called secondary prevention.\n\nIn 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a series of statin recommendations for primary prevention, relevant to adults up to age 75 who have high cholesterol or diabetes, or who for other reasons face an estimated 7.5 percent risk or greater of developing heart disease within 10 years.\n\nLast year, the United States Preventive Services Task Force similarly recommended statins for primary prevention in people aged 40 to 75 who had risk factors like high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking, with a 10-year disease risk of 10 percent or greater.\n\nBut for people over age 75, both panels agreed, there was not sufficient evidence to reach a conclusion. As with many clinical trials, the major statin studies mostly haven\u2019t included patients at advanced ages.\n\n\u201cThe oldest patients enrolled have been up to age 82,\u201d said Dr. Michael Rich, a geriatric cardiologist at Washington University School of Medicine, referring to the PROSPER study published in 2002.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe authors of that study followed 5,800 patients for three years and found that pravastatin provided secondary, but not primary, prevention against cardiovascular events.\n\nBut Dr. Paul Ridker, a self-described \u201cstatin advocate\u201d who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, gets irked at the argument that we don\u2019t know enough to give statins to older patients without heart disease.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any doubt that statin therapy is effective for primary prevention in older adults,\u201d Dr. Ridker said. He cites a recent reanalysis of data from two major studies showing that patients over age 70 taking statins experienced the same reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality as younger ones.\n\nDr. Orkaby and her Harvard colleagues hoped to help resolve such questions with their recent study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, comparing physicians over age 70 who took statins for primary prevention with those who didn\u2019t.\n\nThe team matched each group for 30 variables and found that over an average of seven years, statin-takers had an 18 percent lower death rate, though not a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the same issue, though, an editorial co-authored by Dr. Rich called statin use for primary prevention in older patients \u201can unresolved conundrum.\u201d\n\nThe physician study was observational, so can\u2019t establish causes, he pointed out. And it followed a group that was healthier than average, and all male. Moreover, he said, the findings suggest the drugs had more benefit for those under age 77.\n\nWhat\u2019s not debatable is that while statins do effectively lower cholesterol in older people, their advantages and disadvantages add up differently than at younger ages.\n\nA fairly common side effect, for instance, is myalgia, muscle aches sometimes combined with fatigue. Dr. Orkaby estimates that up to 30 percent of statin takers experience this symptom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSandy Koo, 72, a retired teacher in Los Altos, Calif., began taking Lipitor in her 50s. It lowered her cholesterol, but she found that \u201cI\u2019d walk a block and a half, and I was so achy I had to sit down.\u201d She cycled through other statins for years, looking for one that didn\u2019t make her legs hurt.\n\nMyalgia reverses when people stop taking statins (which also have more serious, but very rare, side effects). Still, many older people already struggle to remain mobile and perform daily tasks.\n\nAt advanced ages, \u201cit\u2019s easier to lose your functional ability and harder to get it back,\u201d said Dr. Lee. (A few small studies report a reversible cognitive impact from statins, too, but he and other researchers didn\u2019t give much credence to the finding.)\n\nFurther, older people often take multiple drugs. Statins interact with scores of them, including proton pump inhibitors (like Nexium), blood pressure and heart medications (like Plavix), and many antibiotics.\n\nComplicating the debate, the 2013 guidelines called for \u201chigh-intensity\u201d statin therapy \u2014 high doses of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or rosuvastatin (Crestor) \u2014 for primary prevention up to age 75, for those who can tolerate it.\n\n\u201cMany patients were doing fine for years on a low-intensity statin, and it was doing the job, reducing their cholesterol,\u201d Dr. Orkaby said. When switched to high-intensity regimens, \u201cthey developed the symptoms you might expect, so they stopped taking them at all.\u201d\n\nAll of which argues for a thoughtful conversation for patients in their late 70s and beyond whose physicians suggest starting \u2014 or stopping \u2014 a statin.\n\nIt can take two to five years for a statin to pay off preventively, so a healthy 80-year-old expected to live that long might well opt to take one or to continue taking one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well known, proven therapy that might prevent a devastating illness,\u201d Dr. Orkaby said. By trying different statins at different dosages, she said, patients usually can find a comfortable regimen.\n\nOn the other hand, she routinely stops statins for nursing home residents \u2014 who are already very ill \u2014 or for elders who are frail, have life-limiting diseases, or grapple with an already daunting number of prescriptions.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of unknowns,\u201d Dr. Orkaby said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do harm by prescribing a medication.

Both children and adults were subject to the agreement, which raised a basic fairness question: Children might be at the mercy of unreliable parents or guardians to follow the rules.\n\nLess than 15 percent of those eligible signed the agreement, and more than 90 percent of children with Medicaid had benefits restricted. A central motivation of the program was to reduce emergency department use, but over all, people were more likely to visit the emergency room. There was no clear improvement in health or healthy behavior. The experiment was scrapped in 2010.\n\nThat individuals bear some responsibility for their health is undeniable. Behavior contributes to nearly half of cancer deaths in the United States, and up to 40 percent of all deaths. But viewing personal responsibility as a central driver of longer lives and lower medical costs is problematic.\n\nAmerican life expectancy has increased markedly in the past century, and few would argue it\u2019s because we now lead healthier lives by dint of willpower. It\u2019s also not clear healthful behavior saves money: People who live longer use more medical care. Smoking cessation, for example, may actually increase long-term health care costs. And ensuring that people bear greater financial risk doesn\u2019t seem to help them make better decisions: A RAND study found that making people pay more for care does reduce how much they use, but that they cut out both highly effective and marginally effective services.\n\nPersonal responsibility is not always demanded equally of people at every income level. Many lawmakers want more \u201cskin in the game\u201d for Medicaid recipients, but not as many clamor for higher deductibles for wealthy Americans \u2014 even though they\u2019re more likely to have enough \u201cskin\u201d to meaningfully play \u201cthe game.\u201d\n\nPersonal responsibility is, of course, not a binary construct. When we say unhealthy behavior \u2014 overeating, smoking, excessive alcohol use \u2014 is not your fault, we may rob people of the initiative to change it. When we say that same behavior is all your fault, we fail to recognize a more complex reality: Health is a product of genes, environment, work, education, family, medical care and many other factors.\n\nAlthough it seems we should encourage personal responsibility, punishing the opposite may be heavy-handed and even counterproductive. Breaking down every factor that leads patients to develop cancer or heart disease or Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 and penalizing or rewarding them based on the share they could in theory control \u2014 seems a herculean and morally suspect task.", "title": "You\u2019re Sick.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "So, what\u2019s this about a \u2018bomb cyclone\u2019?\n\nWhen discussing the storm, some weather forecasters have referred to a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d Calling it a bomb sounds dire, but such storms are not exceedingly rare \u2014 there was one in New England recently.\n\nWhat makes a storm a bomb is how fast the atmospheric pressure falls; falling atmospheric pressure is a characteristic of all storms. By definition, the barometric pressure must drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours for a storm to be called a bomb cyclone.\n\nHere is how it works: Deep drops in barometric pressure occur when a region of warm air meets one of cold air. The air starts to move, and the rotation of the earth creates a cyclonic effect. The direction is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (when viewed from above), leading to winds that come out of the northeast \u2014 a Nor\u2019easter.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened at the end of October, when warm air from the remnants of a tropical cyclone over the Atlantic collided with a cold front coming from the Midwest. Among other impacts then, more than 80,000 electric customers in Maine lost power as high winds toppled trees.\n\nA similar effect was occurring Wednesday, as warm air over the ocean met extremely cold polar air that had descended over the East. Pressure was expected to fall quickly from Florida northward.\n\nWhy is it so cold? What\u2019s the influence of climate change?\n\nThe Times\u2019s Henry Fountain takes a look. Read more here.\n\nThe north, too, had begun buckling down for a major blow.\n\nThe Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with heavy snowfall and wind chills of up to -25 degrees expected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKathryn Garcia, the commissioner of the Department of Sanitation in New York City, encouraged New Yorkers to avoid driving and use mass transit instead.\n\nThe New York City Department of Education announced on Wednesday evening that all public schools would be closed on Thursday. It was the second time in a year that the city made an early call to close schools ahead of a storm. Last March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at noon the day before a predicted snowstorm that schools would be closed; in the end that storm was less severe than expected, but the mayor received little criticism for his caution.\n\nChilly gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. are likely to whip eastern Long Island and southeastern Connecticut starting late Thursday morning, with the potential for downed tree limbs and scattered power failures, the National Weather Service said.\n\nFor Bostonians, Wednesday\u2019s forecast high of 28 degrees was almost a welcome relief after days of temperatures that had hovered in or near the single digits. But it was quite literally cold comfort, with Thursday\u2019s storm expected to drop 10 to 14 inches of snow or more on the city and potentially create blizzard conditions along the New England coast.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The District of Columbia government activated its cold emergency plan on Dec. 27, and on Wednesday, it extended it further. Around an inch of snow is expected in the morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect until 11 a.m. Thursday.\n\nWhile visiting, Hamlet Diaz, 38, said the temperatures were exactly what he was hoping for as his family drove home from an Ontario vacation to Pembroke Pines, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be cold,\u201d he said of his wife, Rachel, and two daughters. \u201cRight now, 8 degrees is what we want.\u201d\n\nSnow even fell on Tallahassee, Florida\u2019s capital. More than 50 miles of Interstate 10 were closed in the Tallahassee area, as well as parts of Highway 90. Mark Wool, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that flurries seemed to come along every few years there.

The performance at Bryant Park is free of charge, while the one at Riverbank costs only the rink\u2019s admission fee ($5 for adults, $3 for children). Anyone who wants to join the action on the ice needs to bring or rent skates and ideally should be capable of navigating the frozen terrain.\n\n\u201cVocalists like to talk about grounded singing,\u201d Ms. Hall Moran said with a grin. \u201cTrying to activate the space between the bottom of your feet and that cold surface is a bit like levitating.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA backing track, at the mercy of each rink\u2019s dubious acoustics, will structure the piece: The mash-up of Carmen\u2019s \u201cHabanera\u201d with Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)\u201d on Ms. Hall Moran\u2019s recently released album, \u201cHere Today,\u201d offers a taste of what the music might sound like. But she has also left ample room for improvisation with the taiko drummer Kaoru Watanabe and the saxophonist Maria Grand, who will be stationed in hockey penalty boxes nearby, as well as through the physical interaction with the swirl of bodies watching and surrounding her.\n\nThis kind of imaginative recontextualization of classical singing has long propelled Ms. Hall Moran. She is a trained mezzo-soprano who never tries to sound like anything else, despite the diverse artistic company she keeps. She has participated in a number of residencies, including one with her husband, the jazz pianist and composer Jason Moran, as part of the 2012 Whitney Biennial; toured with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company; made her Broadway debut as Bess in \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d; and partnered with jazz musicians like the guitarist Brandon Ross and Mr. Moran. In her work, as in that of the visual artist Kara Walker, historical genres like spirituals and Motown (and even the racialized figure of Bizet\u2019s Carmen herself) take on new, charged meanings in juxtaposition with contemporary forms.\n\nDuring a practice session two weeks ago with Moira North, the artistic director of Ice Theater of New York, Ms. Hall Moran indeed evoked Debi Thomas. In a flowing cardigan, ribbons of hair tied back at the base of her neck, she appeared longer limbed than her old hero, though.\n\nWhile a compact body holds advantages for most skating hopefuls, Ms. Hall Moran\u2019s height was actually an asset when she was the only black member of the Shadows, one of the three synchronized skating teams at Terry Conners Rink in Stamford, Conn., where she grew up in an affluent family.

There is no sport more fun to write about in an Olympic year. Skating is full of creative people, individuals who are not muzzled by the team ethos. At the same time, their careers are held in constant judgment by others. Somehow this eternal tension between the objective and the subjective is liberating instead of stifling.\n\nIn September, I traveled to Germany to see a pairs team from North Korea qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Even skaters from the world\u2019s most isolated country couldn\u2019t stop talking to reporters.\n\nNor does the sport ever seem to lose its humor. Adam Rippon, an Olympian from Los Angeles, was asked at the U.S. championships this month what it was like to be an openly gay skater. It was the same as being a straight skater, he said, \u201cexcept with better eyebrows.\u201d\n\nAnd did we mention the costumes?\n\nAt the 1992 Winter Olympics, the skating maven Christine Brennan noticed something familiar about the yellow, orange and red outfit worn by Kurt Browning, a four-time world champion from Canada. Then it dawned on Brennan: Browning was dressed like a warm front on the USA Today weather map.\n\nTara Lipinski, then 15, won gold at the 1998 Winter Olympics with a costume that suggested, I\u2019m going to my first Communion and I intend to yodel.\n\nMy favorite skating character is the droll Tamara Moskvina of Russia, perhaps the world\u2019s greatest pairs coach. The first time we met, at a competition in France, I was among a group of reporters who were all inadvertently wearing press passes for the same news organization.\n\n\u201cC.I.A.?\u201d Moskvina asked.\n\nAt the 1994 Winter Olympics, Moskvina uttered what may be the most incisive and poetic thing ever said about the judging of figure skating: \u201cIt seems to me this is the eternal question between, as we say, lyrics and physics. Some prefer the priest, others prefer the priest\u2019s wife, and others prefer the priest\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday, interest in skating is greatly diminished, except in Japan, where it thrives. At the Winter Olympics, at least we should get to see the sublime strangeness of North Koreans skating to the Beatles. In the United States, though, the only buzz about women\u2019s skating comes from the movies, not the rink, in the form of a mockumentary, \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d about the 1994 knee-whacking of Nancy Kerrigan by associates of Harding.\n\nStereotypes of the sport in those days \u2014 all fur coats, blue blood and white collar \u2014 were not fully accurate. Kerrigan, the supposed ice princess, was the daughter of a welder. And neither is today\u2019s revisionism about Harding scrupulously factual. Yes, she had complicated relationships with her mother and former husband. But Harding was not held back by American skating officials because she did not fit some sequined ideal. Those officials sent her not to one Olympics but to two.\n\nMostly, Harding got in her own way. It happened again last week, when her agent, Michael A. Rosenberg, dissolved their relationship. After promoting the movie and attending the Golden Globes, Harding wanted reporters to sign affidavits and be fined $25,000 for asking about her past, according to Rosenberg.\n\n\u201c \u2018I, Tonya\u2019 is now goodbye Tonya,\u201d Rosenberg wrote.\n\nStill, along with the triple axel, Harding will always have this claim to fame: She is surely the only person ever to report being stalked by professional golfers.", "title": "\u2018I, Figure Skating Reporter\u2019: Full Circle With Tonya Harding", "authors": ["Jer\u00e9 Longman"]}

Its goal is to identify and de-escalate social media conflicts before they erupt into violence on the street.\n\nThe program, developed by the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City in partnership with New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Development, was first tested in 2016. It expanded a year ago.\n\nUnder the program, the violence interrupters spend at least two hours a day monitoring social media for signs of risky behavior, like threats of violence, photos with weapons or expressions of grief or emotional stress, Mr. Polanco said. They focus on people ages 16 to 25. If an alarming post or photo is found, a worker reaches out to the young person.\n\nDuring the pilot program, youth workers interrupted 154 social media feuds; more than half were described as medium or high risk, according to the Citizens Crime Commission.\n\nIn all last year, the city\u2019s Cure Violence sites \u2014 organizations, including True2Life, that treat violence as a public health concern \u2014 intervened in 5,273 street and online conflicts, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which maintains the data. The agency did not have data on what percentage were online interventions. The Citizens Crime Commission is currently working to compile that data.\n\nOn Staten Island, True2Life interrupters focus their outreach on youth in parts of Mariners Harbor and Stapleton, where nearly a third of the residents live below the poverty level, according to a New York City Department of Planning 2016 report.\n\nMichael Perry, 37, a violence interrupter and program supervisor at True2Life, came of age in the 1990s in the Richmond Terrace Development, 10 minutes from Stapleton, where he sold drugs, carried firearms, was arrested, had friends felled by gun violence and was nearly killed himself. It was where \u2014 when Mr. Perry was 9 years old \u2014 his father, who peddled drugs to feed his own addiction, was stabbed to death in a drug feud. Ultimately, Mr. Perry, now a father of two, also found redemption there after praying for a way out.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince joining True2Life four years ago, Mr. Perry has tried to lead by example, telling young people engaged in violence and risky behavior that they, too, can change. In the two years since the pilot launched, Mr. Perry said he intervened in up to 60 online fights that could have led to violence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost social media interventions \u2014 97 percent \u2014 performed during the pilot in 2016 had positive outcomes, according to the Citizens Crime Commission.\n\nTo assist in sorting through hundreds of social media posts, the Citizens Crime Commission is awaiting approval from Facebook to use software they developed that will review, analyze and provide real-time alerts about posts containing violent language.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Patton, an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University and director of SAFE Lab, a research initiative that analyzes the way in which minority youth in Chicago navigate violence online and offline, \u201cbut about how do you take what you want from social media and help people be good stewards of social media?\u201d\n\nMr. Patton began studying the intersection of social media and street violence six years ago after the shooting death of an aspiring Chicago rapper, Joseph Coleman, 18, formerly known as Lil Jojo. Mr. Coleman was killed in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago after a war of words over social media with several rival rappers, including Chief Keef.\n\nStephanie Ueberall, director of violence prevention at the Citizens Crime Commission, said E-Responder includes a 12-week youth leadership program that encourages participants to engage in positive social media exchanges and activism, while teaching them self-empowerment and how to express and manage their emotions.\n\n\u201cSocial media can greatly accelerate violence,\u201d Ueberall said. \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t have the direction or support they need to get into a healthy lifestyle.

Warner Bros., which bought the movie from the Weinstein Company following sexual assault accusations against Harvey Weinstein, has excellent exit-polling numbers to bank on \u2014 the movie earned an A CinemaScore grade overall, and an A+ from audience members under 35.

While investigative reporting ignited the #MeToo movement in the United States, women in China are forced to tell their stories directly online.\n\n\u201c \u2018Me Too\u2019 was an alarm bell for all of us,\u201d said Sophia Huang Xueqin, 30, a journalist in southern China who started a social media platform to report sexual harassment. \u201cWe\u2019re not brave enough to stand out as one individual. But together, we can be strong.\u201d\n\nMs. Huang, who said she left her job at a national news service several years ago after being harassed by a senior colleague, said many women were ashamed to speak out because of the stigma associated with it. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re still in a traditional world where women are supposed to stay at home and support the family and feed the kids,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Communist Party often embraces gender equality as a propaganda theme, noting the strides women made in the first decades of its rule. Mao famously declared that \u201cwomen hold up half the sky.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut in recent years, the government has done little to prevent a resurgence of sexism and workplace discrimination. Men dominate the party\u2019s upper ranks, and government officials and powerful business executives are often protected from allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nLaws on rape and harassment are vague, legal experts say, and courts do not often rule in favor of women who pursue complaints against employers.

I want to be clear on that.\u201d\n\nClaims that Ms. Roiphe\u2019s article would identify someone behind the list appeared on social media around 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, when Dayna Tortorici, the editor of n+1 magazine, tweeted that \u201ca legacy print magazine is planning to publish a piece \u2018outing\u2019 the woman.\u201d Ms. Tortorici went on to encourage the publication, which she did not identify, not to publish names.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe risk of doxxing is high,\u201d Ms. Tortorici wrote, referring to the practice of online critics publishing people\u2019s personal, private information against their ideological opponents without their consent. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, Nicole Cliffe, the founding co-editor of the now defunct feminist blog The Toast, retweeted Ms. Tortorici\u2019s post. Ms. Cliffe added, in later Twitter posts of her own, that Ms. Roiphe was writing her article for the March issue of Harper\u2019s and implored magazine writers to pull their work from the general interest monthly as a protest. She said on Twitter that she would pay the writers the amount they were owed for their articles and help shepherd them toward other publications.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Cliffe, who declined to comment for this article, had pledged to pay more than $19,000 to reporters who had pulled their stories from Harper\u2019s, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\nBrianna Wu, a video game developer who is a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts, latched on to Ms. Cliffe\u2019s offer. \u201cCount me in for 1/2 that cost,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n\nMs. Wu, who said she had experienced online death and rape threats because of articles she has written on video games, said she decided to join the effort because she feared similar repercussions for the creator of the media men list. She added that if she knew the name would not appear in the article, it would \u201cconclude my interest in this.\u201d\n\nMs. Melucci, the Harper\u2019s spokeswoman, said she had no knowledge of writers pulling stories from the magazine.\n\nPart of the social media reaction to the planned Harper\u2019s article most likely has something to do with its author. Ms. Roiphe, 49, is a divisive figure among feminists who first drew public attention for her writing in 1993, when she was a graduate student at Princeton and wrote an article, published in The New York Times Magazine, with the headline \u201cDate Rape\u2019s Other Victim.\u201d In it, she argued that campus feminists had inflated the number of women who had been raped and questioned how the definition of rape was changing.\n\nThe next year, she published her first book, \u201cThe Morning After: Fear, Sex and Feminism,\u201d for which she received death threats, according to an interview with The Guardian in 2013. \u201cI get under people\u2019s skin,\u201d she said in the interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe has continued writing in a contrarian vein, publishing five nonfiction books, a novel and articles in Slate, Vogue and other publications.\n\nSince the first social media posts about the Harper\u2019s article appeared on Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Roiphe has undergone something of a trial by Twitter, with numerous insults hurled her way.\n\nMs. Roiphe said she was not surprised by how people were responding to her on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s a little ironic,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I do address in the piece exactly the sort of Twitter hysteria that we are seeing here.\u201d\n\nGiven the speed of media in the age of social platforms, the subject of the article she has been working on for Harper\u2019s underwent a substantive change just hours after she spoke those words.", "title": "\u2018Media Men\u2019 List Creator Outs Herself, Fearing She Would Be Named", "authors": ["Jaclyn Peiser"]}

That stinginess, coupled with a clock-consuming offense headlined by the N.F.L.\u2019s best rushing attack, powered Jacksonville (10-6) to its first playoff berth since 2007 and its first division title since 1999. The Jaguars host the Buffalo Bills on Sunday in a matchup of longtime playoff outsiders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re built to match up with any team,\u201d safety Barry Church said. \u201cFrom Tom Brady, where they like to do quick stuff and crossing routes, to a guy like Ben Roethlisberger, who likes to develop things and let the play extend, like Russell Wilson as well. We\u2019re going to get tested in the playoffs, but we\u2019re excited for that.\u201d\n\nAs Church hinted, the Jaguars were constructed in a specific way: to counter the increasing diversity of pass-oriented offenses. Their unit is loaded at every level \u2014 elite cornerbacks, speedy linebackers and ferocious rushers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe assembly spanned seasons. It was initiated by General Manager David Caldwell and accelerated by the first-year head of football operations Tom Coughlin, who was hired a year ago to restore the franchise he shepherded from expansion to contender back to prominence.\n\nNo matter how much young talent Jacksonville had procured, its annual spending splurges tended to promote the same reactions, and results, every year: optimism in the spring and summer but despair in the fall and winter. Investing nearly $184 million in guaranteed money from 2014 to 2016, the most in the N.F.L., according to ESPN, yielded all of 11 victories. Only Cleveland (11) won so few games during that span.\n\nAn exceptional draft in 2016, in which the Jaguars with their first three picks landed budding stars \u2014 the shutdown cornerback Jalen Ramsey, the linebacker Myles Jack and the pass-rushing dynamo Yannick Ngakoue \u2014 helped clarify their needs last off-season. Todd Wash, the defensive coordinator, said they prioritized three areas: another cornerback to play opposite Ramsey; a big defensive end capable of rushing the quarterback and setting the edge against the run; and a versatile safety to upgrade their coverage.\n\nThe missing components identified, Jacksonville went and lured them all \u2014 on the first day of free agency. Beyond the money, the cluster of young talent incentivized cornerback A. J. Bouye, defensive end Calais Campbell and Church to sign. Together they have supplemented production \u2014 Campbell\u2019s 14\u00bd sacks tied for second in the league, while Bouye (six interceptions) and Church have helped anchor the secondary \u2014 with accountability and professionalism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA lot of times when you get new guys, they don\u2019t want to step on anybody\u2019s toes,\u201d cornerback Aaron Colvin said. \u201cNot these guys.

But early on, Marrone said, he was skeptical as to how everyone would coalesce.\n\n\u201cSometimes you look at the names on paper and you think to yourself: Maybe these guys can be pretty good,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut you can do all the research in the world and not really know until you get the players in. You\u2019re talking about human nature and personalities, and it\u2019s a difficult situation because those guys got paid a lot of money. You really never know.\u201d\n\nThe mileposts have come at regular intervals: a season-opening 10-sack bonanza at Houston; a five-interception windfall against Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh in Week 5; a shutout at Indianapolis; a smothering showing against Wilson and the Seahawks, who a week earlier had stomped N.F.C.-leading Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cComing out of Pittsburgh, we were like, \u2018I think we have a chance to be pretty successful,\u2019 \u201d Wash said in an interview. \u201cWhen you play against an elite quarterback and you have success, you think you might have something.\u201d\n\nWash coaches his group to play \u201con the edge\u201d and \u201cto the echo of the whistle,\u201d much as he did in Seattle, where he tutored the Seahawks\u2019 defensive line in 2011 and 2012 before following Gus Bradley, Marrone\u2019s predecessor, to Jacksonville. These Jaguars, from their Cover 3 scheme to their brash comportment, evoke a less proven version of the Seahawks\u2019 defense that over the past few seasons has set a standard for excellence.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth teams depended on a four-man rush instead of blitzing, excelled at forcing turnovers and valued speed and athleticism at linebacker to help neutralize pass-catching running backs and tight ends. They also had angular cornerbacks patrolling the boundaries, and every week Ramsey antagonizes, and erases, the opposition\u2019s best receiver the way Richard Sherman did in his prime.\n\nJacksonville has yielded 4.82 net passing yards per pass play (passing yards minus sack yardage divided by total pass plays), the fourth fewest since 2002, according to the sports data service Sportradar. The three teams ahead of them: the 2002 Buccaneers (won the Super Bowl), the 2008 Steelers (won the Super Bowl) and the 2009 Jets (lost in the A.F.C. championship game).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that we don\u2019t potentially have the tools to be as dominant for the next couple of years as those guys,\u201d said safety Tashaun Gipson, referring to Seattle. \u201cWhen you play the Seahawks, you think defense. It\u2019s the staple of what a great defense should look like. Hopefully the comparisons will be null and void, and the Jacksonville Jaguars will be the premier defense for years to come.\u201d\n\nMarrone just wants his team, which surrendered 44 points in a Week 16 loss at San Francisco before rebounding last week at Tennessee, to play well this weekend against Buffalo.\n\nFrom Bill Parcells, Marrone said, he has learned that a team never begins the next season where it left off \u2014 it must prove itself over again. Not that he expects this season to end soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be defined by this game or this season, and I know this team doesn\u2019t, either,\u201d Marrone said, adding: \u201cI have issues enjoying things.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades. Origo, a government-friendly news website, published an article with the headline \u201cOnly blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\u201d And the online theater magazine szinhaz.hu welcomed what it referred to as the Hungarian State Opera\u2019s \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d by staging the opera with \u201cits excellent Hungarian singers.\u201d\n\nMany conservative columnists, including in the daily Magyar Nemzet, have denounced the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of performing the opera only with a black cast. \u201cPolitical correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics,\u201d one columnist said.\n\nThe director of the production, Andras Almasi-Toth, told szinhaz.huthat \u201cwhile performance and staging solutions have progressed \u2014 we play, sing and stage Puccini differently from 50 years ago \u2014 this opera was left out, which makes for a very sterile production. It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine.

Screen Gems, the Sony imprint that produced and released the movie, paid for use of the song, whose rights don\u2019t belong to Mr. Fogerty. But the incompetence really is something. Or maybe it\u2019s the obviousness. Maybe it\u2019s the inevitability. The whole movie seems to exist just for this sequence. Even if I\u2019d paid just to see Ms. Henson mow down gangs of goons (and I probably did pay only for that), I didn\u2019t get my money\u2019s worth. It\u2019s like I bought a can that said \u201cpeaches,\u201d got peaches in the can, but the can was rusty, so the peaches were, too.\n\nMovies and television have a way of using a soundtrack not just to create a mood but to literalize it. You could always count on a master class in splitting the difference between artistry and obviousness during the so-called Blaxploitation era (which \u201cProud Mary\u201d practically pulls a muscle reaching back to evoke). \u201cShaft\u201d and \u201cSuperfly,\u201d on the one hand. On the other, \u201cCoffy is the color of your skin/Coffy is the world you live in.\u201d\n\nFor its part, in a statement to Entertainment Weekly, Screen Gems made Mr. Fogerty an entreaty: Come see the movie! \u201cHe would see\u201d the statement reads, \u201cthat his complaint that the film has nothing to do with the song\u2019s message as \u2018a metaphor about leaving painful, stressful things behind for a more tranquil and meaningful life\u2019 is inaccurate. That is precisely what our Mary is looking to do, and Taraji nails it perfectly.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re not wrong. But come on. Mary winds up taking her self-inflicted babysitting assignment so seriously (I won\u2019t spoil the details) that she actually has no choice but to leave the stress behind.\n\nNow, I know what somebody involved with this movie was thinking. The screenplay seems as if it\u2019s been kicking around for who knows how long (Pam Grier could have done this in 1973, title and all), and maybe it used to be called something else. But it\u2019s \u201cProud Mary\u201d now, and Mary is a black woman \u2014 and when was the last time a black woman, who isn\u2019t Halle Berry, carried any movie by herself, let alone one in which she keeps an arsenal hidden in her walk-in closet, not far from her wigs, one that lets her do the old shoot-and-slide along a warehouse floor? This really is a kind of momentous occasion, and for that you need a momentous song, and \u201cProud Mary\u201d more than satisfies the occasion. Every time I hear Ms. Turner spit out the word \u201cleft\u201d or sing \u201cburnin\u2019\u201d or \u201call right!,\u201d I want to fight to ensure voting rights. I want to karate chop something.\n\nSo it all makes a kind of sense, right? Let\u2019s honor the occasion with a song worthy of it. The occasion might warrant this song. The movie is a different story. Leaning on the Ike and Tina version might bring it into better, blacker alignment with the star, but it addresses neither the central incongruity (Why use this song for a massacre? Why use it for a massacre this badly orchestrated?) nor the artistic injustice of Mr. Fogerty\u2019s complaint.

Israel neither confirms nor denies the existence of the targeted assassination program that Bergman so assiduously documents. The book\u2019s title comes from the Talmud: \u201cIf someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.\u201d This is assassination defined as self-defense. But as Bergman shows, motives aren\u2019t always so righteous and clear-cut; revenge, wrath and other impulses have ways of sneaking in. Before the establishment of Israel in 1948, Zionist underground movements employed what they called \u201cpersonal terror\u201d \u2014 a campaign of bombings and killings \u2014 against the British, who controlled Palestine and restricted immigration by Jews trying to flee Europe.\n\n\u201cWe were too busy and hungry to think about the British and their families,\u201d one assassin told Bergman, recounting how he shot a British officer on a Jerusalem street in 1944. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything, not even a little twinge of guilt. We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.\u201d\n\nImage Ronen Bergman Credit Dana Kopel\n\nMany men who fought in the Zionist underground later became establishment figures in Israel, including Yitzhak Shamir and Menachem Begin; they imported guerrilla methods into the security apparatus they helped create. Assassinations offered a tactical method for a tiny country with rudimentary defenses. The Holocaust, Bergman writes, reinforced the sense that the country and its people would be \u201cperpetually in danger of annihilation.\u201d\n\nMeir Dagan, the spymaster who led the Mossad from 2002 to 2011, kept a photograph in his office of a bearded man in a prayer shawl, kneeling in front of German troops. Whenever Mossad operatives were about to carry out a particularly sensitive mission, he would invite them to his office and explain that the man pictured was his grandfather, shortly before the Nazis murdered him. \u201cMost of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting,\u201d Dagan told Bergman. \u201cWe must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.\u201d\n\nA number of Bergman\u2019s sources express a version of this sentiment. So pronounced is this line of thinking that others have gone so far as to propose that cowardice kept the Jews from revolting \u2014 a statement Primo Levi found \u201cabsurd and insulting.\u201d Still, Levi recognized that this premise provided a sense of agency and a way out of despair. What it also did, and what Bergman is especially attuned to, is mark the country\u2019s political life from the beginning in terms of existential threats. The hostile regimes surrounding Israel have continually stoked such fears; just hours after Israel declared independence in 1948, seven armies from neighboring countries attacked, and opportunistic despots have encouraged terrorism against Israel and its citizens ever since. Extreme measures seem less extreme when it\u2019s a matter of survival.", "title": "\u2018Rise and Kill First\u2019 Shines Light on Israel\u2019s Hidden Assassinations", "authors": []}

While Mr. Murray\u2019s delivery was uneven, he did get off a few laugh lines, including telling the MSNBC hosts that he was working on developing a skin care product (\u201cBlotch\u201d) and a line of wrinkled barn jackets called \u201cfrumpers for guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI convinced this country to elect Donald and I can do it again,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cAlready auditioning candidates, got some prospects. Logan Paul. Martin Shkreli. The Subway guy, Jared Fogle, he\u2019s back. He\u2019s electable. It\u2019s time for America to slide down the Bannon-ster.\u201d\n\nRounding out the impersonations, Leslie Jones appeared as Oprah Winfrey, fresh off her Golden Globes speech that set off days of speculation that she might run for president in 2020. When asked if she was running, Ms. Jones said, \u201cWell, I am a celebrity, so I am qualified.\u201d\n\n\u2018Weekend Update\u2019 Takes On Trump\u2019s Vulgarities\n\nColin Jost and Michael Che targeted the furor surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s disparaging words this week about Haiti and certain countries in Africa. The hosts responded with a mix of detached bemusement and resignation.\n\nMr. Che said:\n\n\u201cCan I be honest? When someone asked me, \u2018Did you hear what Donald Trump called Haiti and Africa?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, boy. Did it start with an \u2018N\u2019?\u2019 But then I heard what he said, and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s it? I\u2019ve said that about countries for not having a CVS.\u2019 Here\u2019s the thing. My job is to make jokes about the news. But Trump saying something racist isn\u2019t exactly news anymore. It\u2019d be news if Trump said, \u2018You know what we need more of in this country? Haitians.\u2019 And by the way, he\u2019s not the only one here that thinks like that. I\u2019ve lived in this country my entire life and I\u2019ve been asked to go back to Africa several times and it\u2019s never been because they thought I\u2019d enjoy it there. But Donald, you do realize how rich these places are in resources, right? I mean, they\u2019re in bad shape because they\u2019ve been robbed and exploited for centuries by Western powers. So the president of the United States calling Africa a shithole is like telling the kid you molested, \u2018Boy, did you grow up to be weird.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Jost followed up and said: \u201cIt was reported that just before the election last year, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer arranged a six-figure payment to cover up an alleged affair between Trump and porn star Stormy Daniels. So at least there\u2019s one storm Trump will pay for,\u201d while a graphic of Puerto Rico flashed behind Mr. Jost.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe went on: \u201cLet me just say what a thrill it is to be alive at a time where \u2018Porn Star Blackmails President\u2019 is like the fourth-biggest story of the week. At this rate, in a year from now, we\u2019re going to see the headline \u2018Trump Found With Dead Hooker\u2019 right next to the crossword puzzle.\u201d\n\nFollowing the theme of Trump-related fatigue, Mr. Che added a joke later about Ms. Winfrey, saying \u201cMany in the public are calling for a run at the presidency in 2020. Oh, can\u2019t we just have a regular one for a while? Just a regular boring, old white dude president that smiles and shape-shifts into a lizard at night. I\u2019m tired of all these fun ideas for president. I miss boring politics.\u201d\n\nWith all the chatter about Ms. Winfrey this week, there was no way that \u201cS.N.L.\u201d was going to let Ms. Jones only play her briefly in the cold open. She returned during \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d alongside Chris Redd, who played Ms. Winfrey\u2019s longtime partner, Stedman Graham.\n\nMr. Redd ended up being the best part of the bit, as he alternated between telling the audience that Ms. Winfrey was and was not running, based on the ambiguous statements Ms. Jones was making. And when asked what his role would be in the White House if Ms. Winfrey won, Mr. Redd said, with a surprised look, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me a question before!\u201d\n\nMs. Jones did have two big laugh lines of her own. Referring to winning the vote of white women, Ms. Jones said: \u201cSomebody needs to look these women in the eye and say, \u2018You deserve my three favorite things: love, respect and a new panini maker. You get a panini! You get a panini! You get a panini!\u201d\n\nAnd when asked if anyone could beat her in the race, Ms. Jones did not miss a beat: \u201cYes. There\u2019s one thing in my life that\u2019s been able to beat me. Bread!\u201d\n\nThe Delightful Weirdness of Sam Rockwell\n\nSam Rockwell, this week\u2019s host, has spent his entire career taking quirky roles. In the opening monologue, the show tackled the fact that he seldom plays leading roles in major movies.\n\nIt featured Mr. Rockwell, less than a week after winning best actor at the Golden Globes for his role in \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d making use of the whole set at Rockefeller Center as he found himself in various (clich\u00e9d) leading man situations \u2014 all while Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cA Little Less Conversation\u201d played in the background.\n\nMr. Rockwell\u2019s oddball brand was an ideal fit for \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d even though a fine might be coming the show\u2019s way. During his first sketch, in which he played a frustrated PBS host on a faux 1990s children\u2019s show called \u201cThe Science Room With Mr. Science,\u201d Mr. Rockwell tried in vain to patiently explain basic science to barely interested children. In his frustration, Mr. Rockwell let slip an expletive that was not caught by censors \u2014 at least on the East Coast. Certainly, he is not the first to do this in \u201cS.N.L.\u201d history. Hello, Kristen Stewart and Jenny Slate!\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rockwell\u2019s portrayal of Stanley Tucci \u2014 another talented actor often relegated to sidekick roles \u2014 in the digital short \u201cTucci Gang\u201d was absurd and yet exactly what one would want Mr. Rockwell to do in this setting.

If Tyler really is a spy, murdering Culber would make sense, as would how he went about it. Wilson Cruz did a nice job portraying Culber in limited screen time, particularly when paired with Anthony Rapp as Stamets.\n\nWhat Worked\n\n1. Mean Captain Tilly\n\nTilly\u2019s transformation into an angry captain in the mirror universe was impressive. She has primarily existed as a foil to Burnham\u2019s dreariness throughout the season, and outside of that, we\u2019ve really seen her be only meek, nerdy and nervous. The mirror-universe arc should allow Mary Wiseman to display more of her acting range.\n\n2. The Original Number One\n\nThe last time Jonathan Frakes sat in the director\u2019s chair for something connected to Trek was two decades ago: the 1998 film \u201cStar Trek: Insurrection,\u201d which was, uh, not good. But that came two years after the brilliant \u201cStar Trek: First Contact,\u201d which Frakes also directed. He also directed several episodes of \u201cVoyager,\u201d \u201cDeep Space Nine\u201d and of course, \u201cThe Next Generation.\u201d\n\nHe did great work in this episode, particularly in the opening scene, during which he effectively ratcheted up the tension as the Discovery crew quickly realized that things were amiss, even beyond the normal scope of time and space. His use of the cameras, which constantly circled the conversations, helped move the story along. In fact, the cameras were rarely stationary, which made the episode even more visually interesting.\n\nI still haven\u2019t forgiven Frakes for this, though:\n\nWhat Didn\u2019t Work\n\n1. Lorca\u2019s Insistence on Protocol\n\nFor some baffling reason, Lorca insists that Culber cannot care for Stamets because Culber\u2019s \u201cmedical objectivity\u201d is compromised. \u201cOh, suddenly you care about protocol?\u201d Culber replies, speaking for all of us. I want to like Lorca. I really do. Jason Isaacs is giving a very compelling performance. But the writers seem to be turning him into a fundamentally different person from who he was earlier in the season. Some might call this character development. Others might say there are more shoes to drop.\n\nI don\u2019t know. But I shared Culber\u2019s incredulity after he reminded Lorca of all the times he\u2019d broken protocol at Lorca\u2019s insistence. Lorca\u2019s response suggests that he doesn\u2019t want to make those mistakes again. But is there another, more qualified doctor on the ship whom we don\u2019t know about?\n\n2. Lorca\u2019s Insistence on Protocol (Part Deux)\n\nLorca seems to have caught on to the romance between Burnham and Tyler. He walks over to Burnham\u2019s station and tells her she can breathe easy because Tyler is safe after a mission.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI need to know that I can rely on my crew to act professionally at all times, particularly now,\u201d Lorca says. \u201cWe\u2019re in dangerous waters.\u201d\n\nThis made me snort. It comes a few episodes after Lorca slept with a superior officer, who repeatedly assailed him for not being professional. Also, perhaps a captain who demands professionalism wouldn\u2019t insist on a mutineer\u2019s becoming a crew member on his ship or on having a phaser within arms reach when he sleeps at night.\n\nAgain, this could all be part of Lorca\u2019s newfound betterment as a captain. If it is, it\u2019s seemed rushed to me.\n\nDid You Catch That?!\n\nHonestly, the entire episode was essentially a callback. So in lieu of the usual Easter egg section, here are a few of the Trek elements that were alluded to most blatantly this week:\n\n1. The agonizer from \u201cMirror, Mirror\u201d:\n\n2. The mirror universe in \u201cEnterprise\u201d\n\n3. The U.S.S. Defiant", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Discovery\u2019 Season 1, Episode 10: Mirrors!", "authors": ["Sopan Deb", "Star Trek"]}

Burnham doesn\u2019t want to tell Saru that Kelpiens in the mirror universe are slaves. Saru doesn\u2019t want to tell Burnham about Culber\u2019s death. Both do so to protect the other from uncomfortable truths, which brings us to the most uncomfortable truth: Ash Tyler, her first love, is actually a surgically altered Klingon spy \u2014 and our old friend, the villainous Voq. By the end of this episode, he\u2019s finally remembered.\n\nOf course, \u201cDiscovery\u201d had telegraphed this for weeks. It was so obvious that I suggested in last week\u2019s recap that it was too obvious. Even in this episode, in the pre-credit scenes (14 minutes!), while Burnham lies in Tyler\u2019s arms, she says, \u201cWe\u2019re all human here,\u201d before adding, \u201cMaybe none of us, no matter what world we\u2019re from really know what darkness is waiting inside.\u201d Sonequa Martin-Green might as well have said, \u201cI am going to foreshadow right here.\u201d\n\nThis leads me to wonder exactly why the \u201cDiscovery\u201d writing staff even went through the motions of trying to turn this into some sort of plot twist. And if anything, now, there are more questions than answers. If Tyler was truly a Klingon spy this whole time, it once again calls into question Lorca\u2019s decision making. He said he screened Tyler personally. How? And what was the point of Voq having his memories wiped so he wouldn\u2019t remember he was a Klingon until later? Because the memory wipe is what eventually blew Voq\u2019s cover \u2014 as they come rushing back, it spurs Tyler-Voq to attack Mirror Voq.\n\nLike with so much of the \u201cDiscovery\u201d maiden voyage, the ambition and ideas are interesting, but the execution often leaves much to be desired. The pacing is closer to the lesser seasons of \u201c24.\u201d Right when an interesting character or relationship is about to be developed, the story line abruptly ends or shifts, often without a payoff that is worth it. This episode is a concrete example of this: The Voq revelation was just not that interesting, mainly because we didn\u2019t get to know Voq well enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat worked\n\nThe opening scene\n\n1. The director T.J. Scott does masterful work in the opening moments, when Stamets\u2019s body is found holding Culber\u2019s body.

It was not well-received by fans or critics \u2014 even though the special effects and action scenes were top notch. \u201cNemesis\u201d was a good action movie. \u201cDiscovery\u201d has great action. But in both, the characters make such astoundingly odd decisions that it makes it difficult to get invested in the action. The plots exist simply as transportation vehicles.\n\nAnd the ending of the episode \u2014 that the Discovery crew has time traveled within their normal universe \u2014 is another big twist, though it was hard to care much about it, at least for now. Too many plot twists come and go in this show without satisfying resolutions; the characters don\u2019t even seem that interested in shocking news anymore. (When Saru finds out that Lorca isn\u2019t, you know, Lorca, he reacts as if he\u2019s told that the mess hall is out of pudding.)\n\n\u201cDiscovery\u201d is a bottom-line show: It\u2019s more concerned with plot ends than with the narrative means. This leaves viewers with the sort of basic questions that shows answer organically, when they don\u2019t opt for cheap plot twists over careful story development.\n\nWhat Worked\n\n1. The fight scenes\n\nThis week, let\u2019s raise our glasses to Glen Keenan, the show\u2019s cinematographer. Georgiou\u2019s containment field was eye-popping and the choreography in the superb fight scenes were unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in Trek. Whatever the other flaws, Mr. Keenan\u2019s work is a bright spot.\n\n2. Rekha Sharma\n\nIt was wonderful to see Ms. Sharma back in action. Like many characters this season, Landry was killed off far too early, wasting an interesting character in the process. (Along with Georgiou, Culber, T\u2019Kuvma, and others.)\n\nWhat Didn\u2019t Work\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nThe \u201cStar Wars\u201d rip-off\n\nThis one is slight \u2014 but it was enough to get me to shake my fist at the television. When Mirror Lorca says to Mirror Stamets, \u201cYour lack of vision continues to disappoint me,\u201d it was way too close to Darth Vader\u2019s \u201cI find your lack of faith disturbing,\u201d in \u201cStar Wars: A New Hope.\u201d It is one of the most famous lines in cinematic history. You can\u2019t pull off a line like that unless it\u2019s a direct homage. And Lorca is no Darth Vader.\n\nSo many \u201cWait, what?\u201d moments\n\nMore important, there were way too moments during the episode where I was baffled \u2014 either by character actions or exposition in the plot. An incomplete and not-so-short list:\n\n\u2022 Early on, Lorca frees his followers from a room of Agonizers. Why were they alive to begin with? In previous episodes, even allies are killed with impunity in the Terran Empire. Enemies are shown being beamed into space. There is no real incentive for Evil Georgiou to not execute a group trying to pull of a coup.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 An ion storm pushed Mirror Lorca out of his own universe? This is a classic Trek plot device. \u201cWe need a way to get from Point A to Point B. Get me an ion storm.\u201d [Update: Multiple readers have pointed out that an ion storm is how the original Enterprise crew, led by Kirk, ended up in the mirror universe. They are correct, so I\u2019ll offer a mea culpa on this one. I forgot. I will, however, stand by an ion storm being a classic Trek plot device!]\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Same if you can understand why the spore drive is no longer instantaneous, which is the entire point of the thing, or why the Terran\u2019s bad faith use of the mycelium network would effect other universes.\n\n\u2022 Why does Georgiou want Lorca to be brought to her alive? She thought he was dead this whole time until Burnham brought him back. Why is it important to her that she gets to kill him?\n\n\u2022 Boy, Burnham is sure able to walk around empty areas of Georgiou\u2019s ship for long periods of time exactly when she needs to, even though many people are trying to find her.\n\n\u2022 So Burnham\u2019s plan, when she and Georgiou get to the throne room, was to kick the guards? And why didn\u2019t Lorca just immediately shoot a defenseless Georgiou?\n\n\u2022 Uh, does anyone know what happened to Franken-TylerVoq-enstein?\n\n\u2022 Why does Georgiou assume she\u2019s a fallen emperor? She put down Lorca\u2019s coup (again). Why can\u2019t she eliminate his supporters, since they have no one to follow?\n\nComing up\n\nWhile I\u2019m not very invested in the time travel plot that\u2019s coming up, I am slightly intrigued. Saru is captain now? More Doug Jones? Yes, please. I\u2019m curious about how the writers will approach a world where the Federation has hit a worst-case scenario \u2014 having lost a war.

Burnham and Georgiou\n\nSonequa Martin-Green is brilliant as Burnham in the scene when Mirror Georgiou tells Burnham, \u201cEverything will be the way it was.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Burnham actually wishes this were the case. Of course, Georgiou means back in the original universe, before the mutiny, back when she was actually a mentor to Burnham. Martin-Green doesn\u2019t say a word \u2014 Burnham can\u2019t reveal her true self at this point \u2014 but her face paints a vivid picture of her internal monologue.\n\nWhat Didn\u2019t Work\n\n1. Why is Saru trying so hard to save Tyler?\n\nDoug Jones is putting in yeoman\u2019s work as Saru, showing genuine concern for The Klingon Formerly Known as Tyler. And yet, I don\u2019t understand why the crew is working overtime to try to save Voq. He is a Klingon spy! He was never actually a human. Saru seems to be trying to save the human side of Voq \u2014 but there never was a human side! He was surgically altered to look like this.\n\nWhich brings up something else: I am further confused over why Voq went so far out of his way to repress his own memories of being a Klingon. Shouldn\u2019t an effective spy know that he\u2019s a spy?\n\n2. The darkness\n\nWe know \u201cDiscovery\u201d is dark. It\u2019s the darkest of all the Treks. It\u2019s also wildly unpredictable. But is anyone having fun watching it? In this episode alone, we see Kelpiens who are either enslaved or eaten. We see a random human\u2019s body explode for a crime we know little about. Mirror Georgiou unexpectedly (and seemingly without justification) kills several people using a device that would be more at home in an \u201cX-Men\u201d movie.\n\nIt would be one thing if this episode were an outlier. But this is the general makeup of the show. (Recently, we saw Culber \u2014 a key character \u2014 have his neck snapped out of nowhere.)\n\nThe crew members seem merely to tolerate one another (Culber and Stamets notwithstanding). No one is having fun. This means the audience doesn\u2019t have fun. The crew of the Discovery doesn\u2019t seem like the type that wants to sacrifice for one another. Why should they? There is very little affection between the characters we see most.", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Discovery\u2019 Season 1, Episode 12: Man in the Mirror", "authors": ["Sopan Deb", "Star Trek"]}

But as the cast\u2019s most recognizable face, Fanning brings a steely intensity to the role when confronting her skeptical male colleagues. She becomes a much cooler customer when, at the end of the day, she sheds her painfully confining corset and lights up cigarette while considering the case. It\u2019s a combination of traits \u201cThe Wire\u201d has trained us to recognize as \u201cgood police,\u201d even if no one in Commissioner Roosevelt\u2019s department is prepared or willing to see it. With any luck, a canny cop-show casting director will recognize it in Fanning.\n\nPlaying the title character presents Br\u00fchl with a tougher task. Dr. Kreizler spends his non-sleuthing hours dealing with the living, not the dead; his work with troubled and vulnerable patients \u2014 children in particular \u2014 requires sensitivity, gentleness and genuine care. As such, aloofness, arrogance and the other traits that typically define maverick masterminds like Kreizler would be out of character. In its way that\u2019s a blessing: Do we really need to see the umpteenth knockoff of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. House? Indeed, Br\u00fchl imbues the alienist with a plain-spoken dignity, even in the moments when his behavior is demanding or shocking by the standards of his day.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t often see the phrase \u201ceminently reasonable visionary\u201d used to describe fictional detectives. (To be fair, with all due respect to our fictional Times colleague, sexually magnetic crime-solving newspaper cartoonists are rarer still.) Kreizler is so calm and so conscientious that he has a tendency to fade into the meticulously constructed background as a result. When he finally does something truly weird, delivering a concluding monologue about his need to \u201cbecome\u201d the killer in order to catch him \u2014 to \u201ccut the child\u2019s throat myself,\u201d psychologically speaking \u2014 the change is so sudden and stark that the lines land with a thud.\n\nThe fact that serial-killer procedurals from \u201cManhunt\u201d to \u201cMindhunter\u201d have painted their protagonists by pretty much these exact same numbers doesn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s true that the source material here predates the current surplus of unstable cop geniuses, but this adaptation of a 1994 book about an 1896 crime must still move and thrill us in 2018. Like the killer himself, who escapes Kreizler during a peculiar pursuit through an abandoned building after taunting him with a grisly trophy, the answer as to whether it will remains elusive for now.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 1: Murder Most Familiar", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "Kreizler stands to a priest and blusters his way into getting Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s tacit approval for his \u201cparallel investigation.\u201d He seems equally self-assured whether he\u2019s arranging a night at the opera or defending the city\u2019s most vulnerable population. He even makes sure to send a tray full of extremely expensive food to Stevie and to his driver, Cyrus, ensuring that they, too, feel part of the team. His affect may occasionally be odd, but no one can doubt his commitment to cooperation.\n\n\u201cThe Alienist\u201d does, however, play to the cheap seats in another way common to period dramas of its ilk: period-appropriate gore and squalor, and as much of it as you can stomach. The episode\u2019s first shot is of a corpse, one of many laid out in a morgue and illuminated by flames lit to burn off the gas inside each cadaver\u2019s bloated belly. A visit to the tenement home of the Santorellis, whose child was one of the victims, reveals a waterfall of sewage, a horde of screeching rats and a baby left to crawl through the hallway while the parents scream at each other inside.\n\nIrish cops beat witnesses to a pulp. Underage sex workers in revealing drag attach themselves like leeches to prospective clients. The eyeless heads of slain humans and cattle stare blindly and balefully at us through the screen. The contrast with the opulence of the opera house and restaurant where Kreizler and his companions convene is striking, sure, but it\u2019s also about as subtle as Captain Connor\u2019s interrogation methods.\n\nMore interesting than all the sociopolitical and physical carnage is the leitmotif that ties it to the rest of the investigation: imagery involving the eye. The emphasis makes perfect symbolic sense as our heroes attempt to bring that which is hidden to light. The grisly removal of an eyeball from a cow\u2019s head by the twin forensics specialists Marcus and Lucius Isaacson (Douglas Smith and Matthew Shear) \u2014 an attempt to determine the killer\u2019s weapon \u2014 certainly makes an impression to that effect, just as an \u201cArkansas toothpick\u201d made an impression on the victims\u2019 eye sockets. The team gazes through magnifying devices (used for the then-fledgling science of \u201cfinger marks\u201d) and later through opera glasses in order to spy on Commissioner Roosevelt and his companions \u2014 an aging Mayor William Lafayette Strong and the philandering robber baron J.P. Morgan.\n\nWhen Sarah and Kreizler ride home from dinner together, their professional and personal chemistry is communicated through a setup that has her staring almost directly into the camera as she speaks, looping the viewer into their conspiracy to carry on with the investigation. Sarah\u2019s eyes also come into play when the corrupt and leering Captain Connor spots an eyelash on her cheek and plucks it from her face, demanding she blow it from his fingers, which are encrusted with the dried blood of a recent assault victim, for good luck.

The series makes much of her being a woman navigating what was until then a department that employed only men.\n\nThe first woman to work in the headquarters of the department was Minnie Gertrude Kelly. Roosevelt hired her during his first week on the job in May 1895. It was a cost-cutting move.\n\n\u201cWhen I took office I found that I had two clerks, one of whom was a stenographer,\u201d he said in a speech on May 9. \u201cI shall be able to get along with one clerk, and he will have to be a stenographer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next day, in eight short lines at the bottom of the front page, Miss Kelly\u2019s appointment was announced:\n\nPresident Roosevelt of the Police Board has appointed Miss Vinie Gertrude Kelley of 160 East Eighty-first Street as his private secretary and stenographer. Mr. Roosevelt said he needed only one clerk, and that he had employed Miss Kelley, as he knew her to be a competent stenographer and typewriter.\n\nAs a clerk and a stenographer, she would be paid $1,700 a year to do the work of two men who had previously earned a combined $2,900 to do the same work.\n\n(And yes, The Times apparently got her given name and surname wrong.)\n\nIn December, The Times reported on the minutes of a commissioners\u2019 meeting, at which they discussed an unnamed \u201cyoung woman stenographer\u201d who was to fill in for a week for a regular \u2014 male \u2014 stenographer at the civil service board.\n\n[Mr.] Roosevelt asked how much pay she was to get. Col. Grant said that it has been arranged for her to get $14 for the week. Mr. Andrews said Secretary Bell thought he could get a substitute for $10 a week. Mr. Roosevelt said he believed a woman should be paid as much as a man if she did the work. The other Commissioners agreed with him, and it was finally decided to pay the girl $12 a week during her temporary engagement.\n\n(Two decades later, Isabella Goodwin would become the department\u2019s first female detective \u2014 an occasion that commanded a full-page spread in The Times.

TNT tried to recreate its grandeur.\n\nBy the dawn of the 20th century, the restaurant was housed in the building on Beaver Street that still holds its name, though not its business, today. It had become a regular fixture in The Times. Charles Dickens visited, and The Times was there. A grand duke held forth, and The Times was there, on page one. The deaths of longtime staff members merited obituaries: a beloved bartender named George in 1879, and a man known as Henri the waiter, in 1904.

{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "For those who could afford it, antiretroviral therapies had granted a reprieve from the death sentence that AIDS represented, but gay men were still routinely regarded with fear, if not contempt. Basic mainstream acceptance of their lives and relationships, much less legal recognition, was a ways off. A taint hung over discussions of gay sexuality, yet the yearning for companionship, love and joy had become far more open since the worst of the AIDS crisis a decade earlier.\n\nPerhaps the most poignant scene in the episode is when the local police are interviewing Antonio D\u2019Amico (Ricky Martin), Versace\u2019s partner. His white tennis shirt and shorts encrusted with his lover\u2019s blood, a forlorn and exhausted D\u2019Amico is asked to explain why \u201cdancers, models and escorts\u201d have been in and out of the house.\n\n\u201cI was his partner, not his pimp,\u201d D\u2019Amico replies. He loved Versace. They were together for 15 years. The officer is mystified.\n\n\u201cThe other men, did they consider themselves to be Versace\u2019s partner too?\u201d he asks.\n\nWhether such a lack of understanding affected Cunanan\u2019s evolution as a killer will presumably be a dominant theme for the rest of the season, which is loosely based on the journalist Maureen Orth\u2019s \u201cVulgar Favors: The Assassination of Gianni Versace.\u201d The first suggestion that he might be lacking a moral compass comes in a flashback to 1990, when a fawning and flirtatious Cunanan approaches Versace and his entourage in a crowded nightclub in San Francisco, but later tells his friends that it was Versace who initiated the conversation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A Catholic and a former altar boy, he passes himself off as a Jew. Asked why he tells straight people that he\u2019s straight, and gay people that he\u2019s gay, he replies, \u201cI tell people what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nVersace invites the young fabulist to a night at the opera: a production of Richard Strauss\u2019s \u201cCapriccio,\u201d for which Versace designed the costumes. They exchange origin stories. Versace\u2019s centers on his muse \u2014 his sister, Donatella \u2014 and love of family. Cunanan\u2019s outlandish tale involves a wealthy father who owned a pineapple plantation in the Philippines, became a pilot for Imelda Marcos, and later ran off with a farmhand, who also served as the chauffeur of his Rolls-Royce. Got that?\n\nIf Versace is incredulous, he\u2019s too polite to say so. He is downright avuncular as he tells Cunanan, \u201cYou\u2019re handsome, you\u2019re clever, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to be someone really special one day.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s some understatement: Returning to 1997, we learn that Cunanan was wanted for four other murders before Versace\u2019s. A botched nationwide manhunt, it seems, has failed to prevent a serial killer from striking again. The F.B.I. has joined the Miami Beach police as they home in on Cunanan.\n\nMeanwhile, Donatella Versace (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) flies in from Italy and asserts control over her slain brother\u2019s business empire, which was headed for an initial public offering on the Milan and New York stock exchanges. She comes across as fiercely protective of her brother\u2019s legacy, if a little sinister. \u201cMy brother is still alive as long as Versace is alive,\u201d she declares, making clear that the brand has transcended the man. She later brushes aside a grieving D\u2019Amico, telling him: \u201cThis is not a time for strangers. This is a time for family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe term \u201cassassination\u201d is, so far, an enigma. The hotels of South Beach, the nightclubs of San Francisco, the gay demimonde and the Italianate arias so lavishly depicted in this series seem fairly removed from the world of politics, particularly at a time when AIDS had begun to recede as a public health crisis and when legal recognition of same-sex relationships still seemed like a distant prospect. How will this show\u2019s creators define politics, including the politics of the closet? What criteria will it use to deem Gianni Versace\u2019s death an assassination?

He steals license plates in a Walmart parking lot and breaks into a deranged smile when a little girl stares at him in suspicion. He switches the radio station when a newscaster says he is wanted for the murder of Lee Miglin \u2014 a victim we haven\u2019t yet met \u2014 and manically sings along to Laura Branigan\u2019s \u201cGloria.\u201d He checks into a seedy South Beach hotel and smooth-talks the receptionist. Scoping out the Versace mansion, he comes face to face with a life-size medallion of Medusa, the mythical Gorgon whose image Versace adopted as a logo, on the front gate. It\u2019s an even match; Cunanan is scary as hell.\n\nI\u2019m struck by his verbosity \u2014 has any serial killer ever had so much to say? His monologues reflect an eye for detail and, of course, a penchant for self-promotion, even delusion.\n\n\u201cI need to make my way in the world,\u201d he tells the hotel receptionist, explaining his interest in being mentored by the Italian designer. \u201cI think Mr. Versace will find my conversation very excellent. I would say, \u2018Sir, nothing is more inspiring to me than that one outfit that Carla Bruni wore. It was a skirt of crinoline, like a giant floral handkerchief fastened with a gold belt and daringly mismatched with a denim shirt.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe lies with abandon, not caring whether his fabrications are even remotely plausible.

I\u2019m a stockbroker. I\u2019m a shareholder. I\u2019m a paperback writer. I\u2019m a cop. I\u2019m a naval officer. Sometimes I\u2019m a spy. I build movie sets in Mexico and skyscrapers in Chicago. I sell propane in Minneapolis, import pineapples from the Philippines. You know, I\u2019m the person least likely to be forgotten. I\u2019m Andrew Cunanan.\n\nThis Whitmanesque survey of economic possibility took my breath away. What if this young, handsome, eloquent man had pursued dreams that didn\u2019t involve duct tape and scissors? Such a pity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe other story in this episode is of Versace\u2019s final weeks, focused in particular on his relationships with his longtime partner, Antonio D\u2019Amico, and his sister and muse, Donatella. Played by a sultry, terrific Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, she worries \u2014 unnecessarily we are told \u2014 that her brother\u2019s brand needs refreshing, lest it be overtaken by new designers like Alexander McQueen and John Galliano.\n\nOf greater emotional consequence is Donatella\u2019s stabilizing influence on her brother and on his partner, whom she scorns for not demonstrating greater fidelity or a willingness to start a family. Whether it\u2019s because of her chiding or a premonition of imminent doom or simply the result of getting older, D\u2019Amico relents. \u201cI want to marry you,\u201d he tells Versace. The designer is skeptical.\n\n\u201cYou can say it in the morning,\u201d he asks. \u201cBut can you say it in the evening?\u201d\n\nEarlier in the episode, the couple visit a hospital \u2014 Versace in the celebrity semi-disguise of a hoodie and sunglasses \u2014 where two AIDS patients, emaciated and deathly ill, can be seen. Lifesaving \u201ccocktails\u201d of antiretroviral therapies had become available, lifting the death sentence the epidemic had imposed on a generation of gay men. Versace, who takes a blood test, recalls that before Donatella was born, he lost an older sister, Tina, to peritonitis.\n\n\u201cUntil that moment, I always believed that if you get sick you can also get better,\u201d he says.\n\nThe episode doesn\u2019t explicitly state that Versace was HIV-positive, as the journalist Maureen Orth contended in her book \u201cVulgar Favors,\u201d on which this television series is loosely based. The implication is certainly strong. But from a dramatic perspective, it\u2019s not important what his illness was \u2014 what matters is that the prospect of premature death hung over these men, who grappled with questions of loyalty, commitment and family, years before same-sex marriage seemed possible, much less became the law of the land. It\u2019s poignant and well worth pondering how Versace\u2019s genius and relationships might have evolved had his life not been cut short at age 50.\n\nFragments:\n\n\u2022 Race has so far been a subsidiary theme, but for brief references to Cunanan\u2019s Asian heritage. (His father was Filipino.) But there\u2019s a telling moment when Cunanan is at a pizzeria and an employee, who has seen the most-wanted poster, goes to the back and dials 911. \u201cIs he black or white?\u201d the dispatcher asks the pizza worker, who is himself black and looks confused. \u201cWhite guy \u2014 he killed four white guys,\u201d the worker pleads. As if any greater urgency were needed.\n\n\u2022 A post-mortem scene \u2014 in which Versace\u2019s body is lovingly dressed by his sister before cremation \u2014 is arguably this episode\u2019s most elegant. His ashes are scooped into an ornate metal box, which flies back to Italy with Donatella.

When Mr. Harrison broke the news that an elimination was nigh, an American contestant named Jamey suggested the cast act multilaterally to resist, invoking a scene from the football movie \u201cRudy\u201d in which the team refuses to play without the titular character. (The international cast blinked blankly at the reference.)\n\nThe night\u2019s sudden bonhomie continued for the rest of the shoot, with the cast members tiptoeing around talk of real-world international relations. \u201cI thought we were going to be a little cliquier,\u201d Ms. Iaconetti said. \u201cBut we all had something in common: being on these shows.

Trump support isn\u2019t philosophical but theological.\n\nTrumpism is a religion founded on patriarchy and white supremacy.\n\nIt is the belief that even the least qualified man is a better choice than the most qualified woman and a belief that the most vile, anti-intellectual, scandal-plagued simpleton of a white man is sufficient to follow in the presidential footsteps of the best educated, most eloquent, most affable black man.\n\nAs President Lyndon B. Johnson said in the 1960s to a young Bill Moyers: \u201cIf you can convince the lowest white man he\u2019s better than the best colored man, he won\u2019t notice you\u2019re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\u2019ll empty his pockets for you.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters are saying to us, screaming to us, that although he may be the \u201clowest white man,\u201d he is still better than Barack Obama, the \u201cbest colored man.\u201d\n\nIn a way, Donald Trump represents white people\u2019s right to be wrong and still be right. He is the embodiment of the unassailability of white power and white privilege.\n\nTo abandon him is to give up on the pact that America has made with its white citizens from the beginning: The government will help to underwrite white safety and success, even at the expense of other people in this country, whether they be Native Americans, African-Americans or new immigrants.\n\nBut this idea of elevating the lowest white man over those more qualified or deserving didn\u2019t begin with Johnson\u2019s articulation and won\u2019t end with Trump\u2019s manifestation. This is woven into the fabric of the flag.\n\nAs I have written here before, when Alabama called a constitutional convention in 1901, Emmet O\u2019Neal, who later became governor, argued that the state should \u201clay deep and strong and permanent in the fundamental law of the state the foundation of white supremacy forever in Alabama,\u201d and as part of that strategy he argued:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is good policy to go up in the hills and tell them that Booker Washington or Councill or anybody else is allowed to vote because they are educated.

He likes an easy target, and his recent fiction goes after predictable boogeymen: social media\u2019s encroachment on privacy (\u201cThe Circle,\u201d 2013), say, or addiction (\u201cHeroes of the Frontier,\u201d 2016). It\u2019s narrative nonfiction that is his natural home. Telling other people\u2019s stories seems to focus him. The sentences take on an Orwellian clarity \u2014 they\u2019re lean and clean, flensed of the tics, doodles and strenuous self-consciousness of his early work, and of the dour didacticism of the new novels. In \u201cThe Monk of Mokha,\u201d he moves lightly between story and analysis, and between brisk histories of Yemeni immigration to America; gentrifying San Francisco; coffee cultivation (\u201cquite possibly the most complex journey from farm to consumption of any foodstuff known to humankind\u201d); and the saints and thieves who dispersed the beans around the world.\n\nYou can dispatch the book in one sitting. I did, on a snowy Sunday afternoon. It left me warmed, but also wired, and a little twitchy. What is it about Eggers? What accounts for this aftertaste that is equal parts admiration and suspicion?\n\nSurely few writers have so tirelessly sought to be of service. \u201cI am owed,\u201d he wrote in \u201cA Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\u201d (2000), his zeitgeist-defining memoir of losing both parents to cancer just weeks apart, leaving him, a college senior, to raise his 8-year-old brother. In every book since, however, the emphasis has shifted. As if to atone for sudden stardom, he considers a different idea: What do I owe?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To find a way to be useful has remained a central concern \u2014 it\u2019s the \u201clapsed Catholic\u201d in him, Eggers has said, who doesn\u2019t believe writing is real work and longs for \u201creal-world application.\u201d \u201cLet us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed,\u201d goes the Beckett quotation, part of which serves as the epigraph for Eggers\u2019s novel \u201cA Hologram for the King\u201d (2012). It\u2019s this very quality that unites him and his subjects. \u201cHe had never felt such energy and purpose. He was needed,\u201d Eggers writes of Abdulrahman Zeitoun, the hero of \u201cZeitoun,\u201d who paddles his canoe around waterlogged New Orleans, rescuing and feeding marooned people and animals.\n\nOf course, Zeitoun himself took a very different turn after the book was published. In 2012, he was accused of attacking his wife with a tire iron. He was charged with attempted murder and, later, for trying to hire another inmate to finish the job. He was exonerated, but the feeling lingers that Eggers treated us to a partial portrait of the man, that he had skirted some inconvenient truths, some essential darkness.\n\nSo it is with \u201cThe Monk of Mokha\u201d \u2014 a conspicuously PG-13 story of race, religion and manhood. As a teenager working at the mall, Alkhanshali adopted a uniform of preppy clothes and was surprised to see how much kinder the world was to him. His friends started calling him Rupert, after the cartoon bear. In essence, this is the character Eggers introduces us to \u2014 the Rupert bear version of Alkhanshali, agreeable to the hilt, whose strongest emotion appears to be mild vexation.\n\nThis is by design. On the first page, we\u2019re told that the trial of the Boston Marathon bombers has just begun. It isn\u2019t mentioned again, but it hovers over the story, supplying the occasion for it. \u201cThe Monk of Mokha\u201d is part of a wave of narratives introducing \u201cthe good Muslim\u201d: funny and cuddly \u2014 almost aggressively unthreatening \u2014 and, crucially, never devout (see also: \u201cMaster of None\u201d and \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d). \u201cHis story is an old-fashioned one. It\u2019s chiefly about the American Dream, which is very much alive and very much under threat,\u201d Eggers writes of Alkhanshali. It\u2019s about \u201cU.S. citizens who maintain strong ties to the countries of their ancestors and who, through entrepreneurial zeal and dogged labor, create indispensable bridges between the developed and developing worlds, between nations that produce and those that consume.\u201d\n\nEggers wants to humanize immigrants, but in his telling, something very different seems to occur. Everything about his characters is outsize \u2014 their bravery and suffering, their resilience and capacity for forgiveness, their contributions to the country. They are supermen, their powers \u201centrepreneurial zeal and dogged labor.\u201d Time was, to make a home in this country it was enough to yearn to breathe free.", "title": "\u2018The Monk of Mokha\u2019 is Dave Eggers\u2019s Latest PG-13 Story About the American Dream", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal", "Books Of The Times"]}

But not everyone has.\n\nIt has been open season on journalists and critics of Pakistan\u2019s military for years now. Disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, intimidation \u2014 all have been brought to bear, and in the vast majority of cases, no one has ever been brought to justice.\n\nMr. Siddiqui is a prominent critic of the country\u2019s powerful military establishment, and on Wednesday he said he believed that \u201cstate agencies\u201d were behind the attack. Human rights investigators frequently accuse the military\u2019s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, of being behind attacks or threats against journalists. Often, especially in cases of intimidation, the security officers make no attempt to hide who they are.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis was an attempt to take me away and turn me into a silent statistic,\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday. \u201cMy worry is that the next time they come for me, it could end up in something much worse.\u201d\n\nMr. Siddiqui is a 2014 winner of the Albert Londres Prix award, the French equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, and has written articles for several international publications, including The New York Times. He has also been become known as a frequent critic of the military on social media.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the military establishment is annoyed with Taha\u2019s Twitter activity,\u201d said Iqbal Khattack, the Pakistan representative for Reporters Sans Frontieres. \u201cWhat has happened is worrisome, but not surprising.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the interior ministry said Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal had sought an investigation into the attack on Mr. Siddiqui.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe media wing of the Pakistani Army declined official comment.\n\nOne military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the matter, said he doubted the military was behind the attack. He said Mr. Siddiqui had written no articles recently that criticized the army and that it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to carry out such an attack based on a handful of objectionable tweets. The officer then scoffed at the idea that Mr. Siddiqui could have escaped an attack by a dozen trained security agents.\n\nThe threats to journalists and dissidents don\u2019t end with the security agencies. Militants on both sides of the insurgency in Baluchistan Province, for instance, including sectarian groups who mainly fight on the military\u2019s side of the conflict, are known for some of the most brazen attacks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Under a sweeping new cybercrimes law passed last January, the authorities have also begun warning or prosecuting journalists and online activists. And that same month, at least five activists known for internet posts critical of the military suddenly disappeared. Four have since been returned and live in exile abroad.\n\nCivil rights advocates, as well as people directly targeted by the authorities, have described actions under the new cybercrime law that included harassment, intimidation, and detention without access to lawyers or family members. In a few cases, physical abuse of those in custody was reported.\n\nMr. Siddiqui was one of dozens of journalists affected by the law. He was summoned last year by the civilian Federal Investigation Agency to answer for Twitter posts they considered to be critical of the military. Mr. Siddiqui refused to answer the summons unless he was formally charged, and filed a court petition claiming harassment. Hearings in the case continue.\n\nPhoto\n\nOffline, too, it has been a perilous decade for Pakistani journalists.\n\nIn one of the latest attacks, in October, another investigative journalist and critic of the ISI, Ahmad Noorani, was gravely wounded in Islamabad. In 2014, Hamid Mir, a prominent journalist and talk show host, survived an attempt on his life. In the same year, the Pakistani writer and broadcaster Raza Rumi narrowly survived a gun attack that claimed the life of his driver in the city of Lahore. He now lives in exile in the United States. In 2011, Syed Saleem Shahzad, an investigative journalist, was found dead, leading to accusations that the ISI was involved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get much, much worse,\u201d said Zarrar Khuhro, a popular talk show host with Dawn News. \u201cRegardless of who carried out this attack or others before it, the culprits always go unpunished. So why would the attacks stop?\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, we are looking at a new era of oppression in Pakistani journalism,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the new normal.\u201d\n\nAzhar Abbas, the managing director at Geo News, Pakistan\u2019s largest news channel, which has repeatedly come under pressure because of its critical coverage of the military and its support for the civilian government, said it was essential for journalists to come together and put pressure on the government to launch a transparent inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t physically assault people, or make them disappear for having an opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAs journalists we have to resist these attempts to be silenced and make sure the culprits are caught.\u201d\n\nBut the attacks are raising fears, causing many to self censor rather than risk arrest or threats against their families.\n\nIslamabad\u2019s police superintendent, Syed Mustafa Tanveer, said on Thursday that Mr. Siddiqui\u2019s case was formally under investigation, though he said it was too early to say who the attackers were.\n\n\u201cYesterday, Taha was really shaken, but today we have called him back in to ask some more questions and to help us prepare sketches of the attackers,\u201d Mr. Tanveer said.\n\nMr. Siddiqui said that after reaching the police station on Wednesday, he asked the investigating officer to let him know as soon as anyone was arrested.\n\n\u201cWhen I said that, he just looked right at me and laughed out loud,\u201d Mr. Siddiqui said. \u201cRight to my face.\u201d", "title": "\u2018The New Normal\u2019 in Pakistan: a Journalist on the Run From Gunmen", "authors": ["Mehreen Zahra-Malik"]}

Now comes Ada\u2019s aftermath, as she struggles not to let her trauma define her life.\n\nIn some ways, the structure of \u201cThe War I Finally Won\u201d could not be simpler. \u201cYou can know things all you like,\u201d Ada says in the very beginning of the book, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean you believe them.\u201d This is the book\u2019s anchor. Ada\u2019s journey, we understand, will be about learning to believe.\n\nAda\u2019s physical and external problems will be solved rather quickly. In the book\u2019s first chapters, her clubfoot is repaired and she finds herself mending in a hospital. She discovers that her horrible mother is conveniently dead, so Ada and her brother, Jamie, can live happily with their kind guardian, Susan, in a comfortable country cottage. But those physical solutions only take her so far, because of course Ada\u2019s journey isn\u2019t really a physical one at all. Her journey is about constructing belief, and that path is less clear.\n\nAda can\u2019t simply shake off the pain of the past, because she suffers from a kind of PTSD. Fearful and nervous, she hoards, mistrusts physical affection, is ashamed to talk about her foot and struggles to express love until the very end of the book. External events occur \u2014 Susan gets sick , a Jewish refugee named Ruth joins them and Ada\u2019s sponsor, Lady Thorton, suffers a great loss when her son dies \u2014 but these events matter primarily because they give Ada the opportunity to learn, to experience empathy and, ultimately, to love.\n\nAda also grows through direct lessons from others, who increasingly inspire trust. Halfway through the book, Susan offers a variation on the theme. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel safe to actually be safe,\u201d Susan reassures Ada after a moment of panic on a rooftop. Safety is not something Ada can feel yet, but she is able, after so much work, to accept that maybe the safety is there before she can feel it. And that Susan can help her believe in it. This is key, because Ada\u2019s healing feels most complete when she becomes whole enough to see past her own pain, and able to believe or feel for others. As Ada comes to see that her life is better than it has ever been, she recognizes that some of her loved ones are struggling. In the end, she gets her turn to help, and so becomes stronger, more whole.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBy the story\u2019s final page, that initial anchor sentence has shifted. \u201cYou can know things all you like,\u201d Ada tells us. \u201cAnd someday you might believe them.\u201d That \u201cmight\u201d is my favorite word in the book. It makes me believe in Ada, in her journey. The beauty of this book is in the slightness of this shift, in the fact that Ada is still not quite certain but has hope.\n\nRarely is a children\u2019s book so honest in its approach to suffering, and the possibility that recovery will never be complete. Ada will always limp, and she may always feel survivor\u2019s guilt or struggle to trust those who love her. In this way, \u201cThe War I Finally Won\u201d is daring. But there is comfort too, in Ada\u2019s desire to love and grow.\n\nThis willingness to allow for true contrast is the book\u2019s greatest strength. Despair and hope, coldness and warmth, fear and trust, ugliness and beauty. Bones break and knit back together. A terrifying climb to a rooftop reveals a breathtaking sky full of stars. Children are broken and then made whole. And yet they will always have been broken.\u201cThe War I Finally Won\u201d explores how pain can lead to strength, or fear to joy. In the end, we accept that Ada will carry her burden. But we also know that she will work to be okay. The power of this book is that it describes, slowly and sometimes painfully, that it is possible not just to live through pain, but to live with it.", "title": "\u2018The War I Finally Won\u2019 Tells One English Girl\u2019s Survival Story", "authors": ["Laurel Snyder", "Kimberly Brubaker Bradley", "Children S Books"]}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "All of this is very familiar, to the point where \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d starts off feeling ordinary. It reads too much like another knockoff while the author sets up his very basic story elements. (At heart, this is a locked-room mystery in the great Christie tradition.) We need a rundown of who the neighbors are, especially the Russells, the family Anna spies on most avidly. We need to know about Anna\u2019s past life as a child psychiatrist, and about the husband and daughter who have abandoned her in the house. We need to raise eyebrows about the terse, hunky tenant in the basement.\n\nImage A.J. Finn Credit Hope Brooks\n\nWe don\u2019t need a lot of flaunting of the author\u2019s cineaste credentials, but we get it anyway. This will work better later, when the book intercuts movie dialogue from the DVDs Anna watches with what is actually happening in her real world. There are shades of Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cShadow of a Doubt,\u201d \u201cVertigo,\u201d \u201cSpellbound,\u201d \u201cSuspicion\u201d and, of course, George Cukor\u2019s \u201cGaslight,\u201d which has an enormous influence on the whole book (and has influenced many of its predecessors). But despite the value of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d for any writer, this author loves using examples to a fault. At one point, after Anna has dutifully invoked \u201cGaslight,\u201d the book also throws in: \u201cBecause it was no dream. (\u2018This is no dream! This is really happening!\u2019 \u2014 Mia Farrow, Rosemary\u2019s Baby.)\u201d\n\nOnce the book gets going, it excels at planting misconceptions everywhere. You cannot trust anything you read. Even Anna can be made to doubt her own actions and memories, and she has absolutely no allies. Everyone on the street thinks she is peculiar, and that\u2019s the best-case scenario. When she deals with the police \u2014 an inevitable interaction in this genre \u2014 they happen to notice that she has stockpiled enough wine and prescription drugs to sedate an army. There\u2019s no chance they will ever believe anything she says as the danger level rises.\n\nA book that\u2019s as devious as this novel will delight anyone who\u2019s been disappointed too often. (Case in point: those who were hooked by Paula Hawkins\u2019s \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d but then suffered through her \u201cInto the Water.\u201d) And \u201cThe Woman in the Window\u201d sneaks in its zenith of trickery into an effortless early scene. Anna makes a disastrous effort to go beyond her front door and meets someone she\u2019s eager to know. The two of them spend a wonderful, confessional evening back in the house, playing chess and getting loaded. This all goes down so smoothly that its consequences come as a complete shock. And there\u2019s a superb snowbound horror story buried deep inside this novel\u2019s many layers.\n\nHow well does it all hold up, once Finn\u2019s cards have been fully played? Pretty well, but there are problems. An enormous surprise meant to arrive more than two-thirds of the way through the book was guessable even by me \u2014 a terrible guesser \u2014 almost from the start. One character has huge credibility problems. And the writing is serviceable, sometimes bordering on strange. \u201cMy robe is smeared across the floor like a skid mark\u201d offers Anna, as well as \u201cthoughts tumble-drying in my brain.\u201d She really does need to get out of the house more, if only to shake off those domestic turns of phrase.\n\nFor hard-core aficionados of classic logical mysteries, this book includes some special delights. Its nods to contemporary tastes are offset by things like a reference to \u201cThe Thinking Machine,\u201d the nickname of Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, a fictional amateur detective created by Jacques Futrelle. Van Dusen was beloved in his time, but that time was so long ago that Futrelle died on the Titanic. Finn knows commerce but he also knows the classics, old and new. He truly aspires to write in their tradition.", "title": "\u2018The Woman in the Window\u2019 Nods to Classics Old and New, From Hitchcock to \u2018The Girl on the Train\u2019", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "This new collection of stories, like all of Krasznahorkai\u2019s work, consists mostly of the searching, capacious sentences for which he has become known, each additional clause circling the unutterable like \u201ca merry-go-round, around the thing itself,\u201d as the narrator of \u201cObstacle Theory\u201d states.\n\nKrasznahorkai has dismissed the short sentence as \u201cartificial,\u201d a form that is no more than a custom of \u201cthe last few thousand years.\u201d He is not immune, however, to the allure of a succinct end-stop declaration. Several stories in this collection, in fact, begin with them. One starts: \u201cMemory is the art of forgetting.\u201d Another story, \u201cJourney in a Place Without Blessings,\u201d is a series of brief numbered sections, many consisting of only a few haunting words, and some as short as \u201cThe congregation is silent.\u201d Krasznahorkai executes these staccato sentences as skillfully as his signature expansive ones, and witnessing such a distinctive writer deviate a bit in sentence style is an unexpected pleasure of this new book.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs with any writer in translation, that pleasure wouldn\u2019t be possible without Krasznahorkai\u2019s excellent translators: John Batki, Ottilie Mulzet and George Szirtes. Batki is a self-proclaimed kilimologist, an expert in old weavings, which seems like a useful background for the intricate word-tethering of literary translation, and especially of sentences as elaborate as Krasznahorkai\u2019s.\n\nWith impressive subtlety, the translations recreate the playful irony that undercuts the incessant anguish in each story, an anguish that can become predictable and therefore tiresome. In \u201cA Drop of Water,\u201d a man despairs about the towers of excrement among the ancient ghats and temples of Varanasi. But excessive fixation like this also heightens a reader\u2019s attentiveness to the beauty of the next image, when the narrator\u2019s attention shifts to a group of children, \u201cswirling like a whirlpool around the hand holding the iPhone.\u201d What an arresting contrast \u2014 the image of that most ubiquitous of devices causing a whirlpool of children in one of the oldest, continuously inhabited cities in the world.\n\nThe poignant juxtaposition of the ancient and the new is central to the story \u201cBankers\u201d as well. A traveler arrives in Kiev to visit an old friend, hoping to join the catastrophe tourists headed to Chernobyl\u2019s exclusion zone. To his surprise, his friend arrives at the airport with another man already in the car, a man who talks endlessly about workplace minutiae while the arriving traveler looks despondently out the window at the endless banks lining the streets of Kiev. Noticing everything from Megabank to Renesans Kapitol, the traveler, Fortinbras, who shares his name with the Norwegian foil to Hamlet, thinks to himself, \u201cGood heavens \u2026 what is going on here.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nFor most writers, an impulse to capture the bewilderment of moving through a bank-ridden city might lead to a playful list of half a dozen bank names. But Krasznahorkai constantly pushes beyond the expected, escalating everything to the brink of deliriousness with an absurd list of 20 banks. To fully experience the exhilarating crescendo of a Krasznahorkai sentence requires a willingness to submit to this kind of frantic excess.\n\nNot all the stories, however, are frantic and interior. \u201cUniversal Theseus,\u201d one of the most haunting in the book, consists of formal lectures delivered in an ominous auditorium. At the outset of the first lecture, the speaker calmly tells his audience that he knows he\u2019s been invited because someone else wasn\u2019t available. He also admits what he does not know, which is who his listeners are or what they expect of him. He tells his audience he has a \u201clingering bad feeling\u201d that they themselves \u201caren\u2019t quite clear\u201d what they want from him either.\n\nAfter these delightfully brazen disclaimers, the lecturer decides to tell his listeners about the \u201cdeadly honey\u201d of melancholy and what makes it \u201cthe most enigmatic of attractions.\u201d When the lecturer observes a gentleman lock the door behind him, rendering him a prisoner in the auditorium, unable to escape his audience, it feels a bit like a self-fulfilling prophecy, as if he has willed himself into such an unbearable situation \u2014 and a subtle comment on the self-sabotage that humanity continually commits.\n\nHow to escape the bewilderments of the 21st century is the central question of the book: a \u201csequence of steps enabling one to back out of the world,\u201d as the trapped lecturer puts it. Krasznahorkai\u2019s stories refuse to submit to the expectation that fiction provide any kind of reassurance or intimation of redemption. What the stories offer instead is a singular kind of immersive intensity in scenes flooded with such despair that reading them feels at times like drowning in the spiritual questions of our era. When Fortinbras enters one of Kiev\u2019s best-known landmarks, St. Sophia\u2019s Cathedral, he is surprised to find hardly any other tourists there. His friend explains that visitors rarely linger in Kiev now. They all rush right to the Zone to take apocalyptic photographs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWandering-standing in the cathedral, alone with the saints, the melancholy Fortinbras is aware of their gaze, inquiring of him what happened to the past. \u201cWhere is it,\u201d he senses the saints asking, \u201cwhere is that place where their soulful nature would mean something?\u201d A chagrined Fortinbras, who had arrived in Kiev as eager to step through the emptiness of Chernobyl as all the other tourists, concludes that such a place may be nowhere.", "title": "\u2018The World Goes On\u2019 \u2014 and So Do the Sentences", "authors": ["Idra Novey", "Laszlo Krasznahorkai"]}

The same is true for Mr. Trump\u2019s centerpiece project, the border wall.\n\n\u201cAfter it became evident that there wasn\u2019t a dramatic change on the part of the administration, then the smugglers started selling their product again and the flow began to resume,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn releasing the data, the administration acknowledged that it had lost ground in its effort to stem immigration. But it also seized on the statistics to make the case that Congress should overhaul immigration laws to deter more people from coming.\n\nThe Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have been seeking new border security measures in exchange for permitting 800,000 young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers to remain in the United States. On Tuesday, the president indicated he would even consider allowing millions more unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country, provided Congress took steps to keep new ones from entering.\n\nThe numbers of apprehensions are an indication of border activity, but they do not count those who slip through undetected. Though the recent increase makes clear that the flow of migrants has resumed, the numbers have not approached the crisis levels of 2014, when they reached nearly 70,000 in a single month, many of them children traveling alone. Homeland Security officials noted that the 2017 apprehensions still represented a 40 percent decrease from the year before.\n\n\u201cThe final border apprehension numbers of 2017, specifically at the southern border, undeniably prove the effectiveness of President Trump\u2019s commitment to securing our borders,\u201d Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement. He also called on Congress to close what he said were \u201cloopholes\u201d that incentivized illegal immigration and were being exploited by migrants. By that, he seemed to reference the asylum system, as well as special protections for children who cross the border without adult supervision.\n\nTens of thousands of people apply for asylum annually. The vast majority are denied, and cases can drag on for years, during which time many applicants are released from custody and establish ties to the United States, eventually deciding to stay illegally. Their numbers have contributed to an ever-growing immigration court backlog, with more than 650,000 cases now pending, up from 520,000 in late 2016, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group based at Syracuse University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmong those stopped at the border in December were 8,000 families and 4,000 so-called unaccompanied minors. Family detention centers are so full that many families are being let go, with the parents fitted with ankle monitors, the kind of \u201ccatch and release\u201d practice that the administration has been trying to avoid all along.\n\nResponding to the growing number of people crossing the border, the White House late last year pulled together an interagency task force, which has been meeting to evaluate a suite of new deterrence policies, including separating parents from their children as their cases work through the courts, which immigration advocates have denounced as cruel.\n\n\u201cThe administration is committed to using all legal tools at its disposal to secure our nation\u2019s borders, and as a result we are continuing to review additional policy options,\u201d Mr. Houlton said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Mr. Harvey and his wife, Peggy Koeppel, sold their 12th-floor apartment in July, after retiring and moving to the Hudson Valley, but not before they were forced to drop the price by 10 percent to secure a buyer.\n\nJust before a meeting of unit owners to discuss the survey results, on March 29, Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, sent a letter to the board saying that removal of the letters would constitute a \u201cflagrant and material breach of the license agreement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Garten also said that many apartment owners had reached out to express \u201ctheir grave concerns with the Board\u2019s contemplated action.\u201d\n\nThat cast a pall over the meeting, Mr. Koeppel said. \u201cThere was definitively a fear in the air.\u201d\n\nWith a new board on its way in, a decision was delayed. Then, last week, the residential committee of the board asked the court to issue a declaratory judgment that the condominium has the right to use or remove the letters without violating its licensing agreement with Mr. Trump.\n\nUnder the licensing agreement, the committee acknowledges the board\u2019s obligation \u201cto maintain the building in a manner consistent with \u2018super luxury\u2019 condominiums in Manhattan.\u201d\n\nBut, the committee said in its suit, the agreement \u201cdoes not obligate the board to use or display identifications,\u201d but rather \u201c grants the board the right to use the identifications should the board choose to do so.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was first reported by The New York Post.\n\nHarry Lipman, a lawyer for the condominium, said that the committee \u201ctook no position on whether the signage should or should not be removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we obtain the ruling,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cthe committee will give the unit owners the opportunity to express themselves through a fair and democratic vote on the issue without any threat of legal action by the licensor.\u201d\n\nThat election is not a foregone conclusion, of course, but in the presidential election, Mr. Trump received just 64,929 votes in Manhattan, versus 579,013 for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.", "title": "\u2018Trump Place\u2019 Asks if It Can Be Called by Any Other Name", "authors": ["Charles V.

As an immigrant, I was concerned that the country I have grown to love was, to quote a recent Op-Ed article in your paper, beginning to undergo \u201ca national descent into chaos.\u201d Towns were being destroyed by their own citizens for what they saw as police injustice, our police were being slaughtered in cold blood and New York City\u2019s mayor said he had warned his son against the police.\n\nI thought sanctuary cities were unjust to our own citizens, and our attempt to keep intact our reputation as welcoming Uncle Sam was becoming detrimental to our own welfare. Mr. Trump\u2019s language is often inappropriate and juvenile, and I had hoped he would rise to his new position. But although words are indeed important, I thought his tough take-no-prisoners manner and, yes, even his unpredictability might be what was needed at this particular time to cause offending persons and countries to sit up, consider us seriously, and think twice about taking advantage of us financially and otherwise.\n\nANNE MINICH\n\nMILFORD, CONN.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMy hometown, Newton Falls, Ohio, was once a working-class Mayberry.

Ms. Wolfe chuckled and flashed a smile before continuing her descent.\n\n\u201cIt was a gutsy move, and I like being made fun of,\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, 35. \u201cPlus I really didn\u2019t think of myself as a Broadway star.\u201d\n\nYet she had been charging Broadway since her childhood in Visalia, Calif., an inland agriculture town known for its citrus, olives and cotton. From an early age, she sought the spotlight. For a preschool concert, she was relegated to the back row but parted the children \u00e0 la Moses to take center stage when the singing started.\n\nAround the house she mounted musicals starring the family cats and broke into song willy-nilly with her hairbrush microphone. While still in grade school, she arrived at the first rehearsal of a junior college production to star in \u201cAnnie\u201d having already memorized her lines. And before the ripe age of 17 she had played the lead in \u201cHello, Dolly\u201d not once but twice.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe was 15 and in New York City for the first time when she discovered a truth about her dream job. \u201cI had no idea that Broadway was the name of a street,\u201d she said. \u201cStarring \u2018on Broadway\u2019 certainly made more sense once I saw that!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter graduating in 2004 from the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Conservatory of Music with a B.F.A. in musical theater, Ms. Wolfe made her Broadway debut three years later in the revival of \u201c110 in the Shade\u201d and has worked in shows such as \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood,\u201d \u201cThe Last Five Years\u201d and \u201cFalsettos\u201d ever since. She took the lead in \u201cWaitress\u201d last June.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Betsy she can\u2019t do something because she\u2019ll prove you wrong,\u201d said her mother, Bonnie Wolfe, an artist and speech pathologist. Scott Wolfe, a history teacher, athletic coach and former professional baseball player, wholeheartedly agreed about his daughter.\n\nMonths after the opening of \u201cBullets,\u201d Ms. Wolfe and Mr. Krauthamer met again face to face at an after-show get-together. (Both credit Zach Braff, then a stage neophyte, for inviting musicians to a traditionally actors-only social event. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize musicians weren\u2019t usually invited to cast gatherings,\u201d Mr. Krauthamer said.)\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Krauthamer maneuvered to start a conversation and was relieved when Ms. Wolfe \u201cdidn\u2019t run away from a musician,\u201d he said. In an easy exchange, the two soon unearthed similarities under their more obvious differences.\n\nMs. Wolfe was raised in a West Coast conservative Christian home; Mr. Krauthamer grew up on Long Island, in Baldwin, N.Y., in a liberal Jewish family, the son of Marshall Krauthamer, a special-education teacher and guidance counselor, and Susan Krauthamer, a nurse practitioner.\n\nBoth sets of parents shared similar values including service to their communities, the necessity of hard work, and a commitment to their children\u2019s ambitions that stopped well short of being pushy.\n\nLike Ms. Wolfe, Mr. Krauthamer\u2019s path to performing started early. He picked up the French horn in grade school after discovering the drums and trumpets had been claimed. A high school music camp cemented his zeal, after which he tracked down and phoned, without his parents\u2019 help, Jerome Ashby, a much-loved horn player then with the New York Philharmonic and also teaching at Juilliard.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Eventually, Mr. Ashby (who died in 2007) became his teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music. Mr. Krauthamer graduated in 2004 and received a master\u2019s degree in Music from Yale in 2006.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter college, Mr. Krauthamer worked in restaurants: dishwashing, cooking and bartending while supporting his career. Ms. Wolfe sold household items and furniture on Craigslist, stuff she mostly picked up for free. (She still has this urge when she spies good castoffs on the curb.)\n\nIn that first conversation, the parallels in their temperaments also became evident: Both are known for their honesty and authenticity. \u201cLong before I knew I loved Adam, I loved how we talked to each other,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said. \u201cNot for a second were either of us anyone other than who we are.\u201d\n\nThat night Mr. Krauthamer asked for a date, but Ms. Wolfe demurred. Despite their fun and flirty repartee, she wondered if Mr. Krauthamer\u2019s smooth moves might not be exclusive to her. Also, because of her previous relationships, she had little dating experience.\n\nPhoto\n\nIndeed, Mr. Krauthamer had dated plenty and had had his share of relationships, but none had jelled. He had recently shifted to thinking he might remain single, but after connecting with Ms. Wolfe that notion seemed ridiculous.\n\nAt subsequent gatherings, the two easily picked up where they\u2019d left off, but it took months, a lot of back-and-forth texting, and persistence from Mr. Krauthamer to persuade Ms. Wolfe. \u201cI was willing to wait,\u201d he said.\n\nIn June 2014 his perseverance delivered. \u201cBroadway stars have to eat sometime?\u201d was the line that pushed Ms. Wolfe to agree to dinner; afterward they shared a kiss in Riverside Park.\n\nIn both their professions, timing is paramount. But here it was everything. \u201cI\u2019d been savoring the newness of what I knew was going to be a great relationship, and that kiss was everything I thought it was going to be,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Krauthamer found Ms. Wolfe unusually attentive, especially for someone so busy. Besides his own music career, Mr. Krauthamer founded the Jerome Ashby Scholarship at the Juilliard School. He is also the executive director of Musicians for Pension Security, an organization that works for transparency and accountability in the management of retirement benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAdam is sexy, smart, funny and domestic \u2014 I found it impossible not to love him,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.\n\nFor Evan Welty, a close friend of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s since childhood, the pluses of this relationship go far beyond a shared love for performance. \u201cAdam\u2019s passion for justice and public policy awakened Betsy to a world outside the theater,\u201d Ms. Welty said. \u201cFor the first time I\u2019ve seen Betsy really enjoying life.\u201d\n\nWith an unspoken understanding, the couple slid into a devoted relationship. The actress left quirky presents and cute notes on his orchestra seat; the horn player cooked her post-show dinners, and, though he is not a coffee drinker, became expert at making Ms. Wolfe\u2019s particular morning brew \u2014 black with a splash of coconut oil. Within the year they had moved in together.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBroadway careers are filled with crazy ups, downs and in-betweens, and they both really get what it is the other does,\u201d said Adam Kantor, a Broadway actor and friend of Ms. Wolfe\u2019s with whom she often performs.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, nearly a year to the date of their first date, with Ms. Wolfe soon on her way to spending months in La Jolla, Calif., to appear in \u201cUp Here,\u201d Mr. Krauthamer proposed marriage. \u201cWe were deeply in love and I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her,\u201d he said.\n\nCarving out time for a wedding between show schedules was nearly impossible: a 2015 plan to marry in a Manhattan townhouse once owned by Liz Taylor was thwarted after discovering the elevator to the only bathroom was not functioning and couldn\u2019t be fixed on their timeline.\n\nBut on Dec. 17 just over 100 guests gathered in an outside courtyard at the Rancho Valencia Resort in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., for a ceremony combining aspects of both families\u2019 faiths.\n\nLed by the groom\u2019s brother-in-law Matt Gewolb, who was deputized by the County of San Diego for the occasion, the couple exchanged personal vows against a cascade of autumnal-colored roses and eucalyptus leaves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Krauthamer promised to support Ms. Wolfe\u2019s \u201cwildest dreams and relentless work ethic\u201d and to shop with her even \u201cduring the brief between-show break on a two-show day.\u201d\n\nMs. Wolfe said Mr. Krauthamer is her \u201cfavorite and only barista.\u201d And then she added: \u201cYou are my best friend. You are my person. You\u2019re my home.\u201d\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, the sun set beyond the Pacific Ocean. More than a few guests were teary, including Susan Mathews, Ms. Wolfe\u2019s junior high school drama teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s been no one like her before or since,\u201d she said. In speeches, toasts and bubbling conversations, guests extolled the overwhelming generosity of the groom and bride, to their friends and families and to each other.\n\n\u201cI have never seen such a solid and respectful relationship,\u201d said Dannielle Thomas, Ms. Wolfe\u2019s manager.\n\nMs. Wolfe said: \u201cMy relationship is drama free, I save that for the stage.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Waitress\u2019 Star Has a Tip for You: Marry Your Best Friend", "authors": ["Louise Rafkin"]}
